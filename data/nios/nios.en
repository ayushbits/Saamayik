The Indian music system is very closely related to nature.
 The standard notes of Indian classical music are set according to the sounds produced by animals and birds in a certain conditions and environments.
In this lesson we will learn about ragas.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able"
differentiate between swaras and ragas
idenitify Janaka Ragas and Janya Ragas
"and demonstrate two Ragas-Mãyamãlava Gowla,DheeraShankarabharana."
We learn about Raga which is the core of Indian music.
A raga is a series of notes systematically arranged 
which can bring out different experiences in a musician or a listener.
The  whole structure of Indian music is built around the concept of raga.
First we will discuss about swaras.
Every raga has a route which is arranged by
an Aarohanam (swaras arranged in ascending scale) 
an Avarohanam (swaras arranged in descending scale).
The number of ragas include 72 Melakartha ragas
but many ragas are derived from these 72 Melakartha ragas 
The ragas that are derived from any of the Melakartha raga is called Janya raga 
The parent raga is called Janaka raga.
Melakartha ragas are the parent ragas.
A  Melakartha  raga  is  one  which  has  all  7  swaras  and  has Aarohanam and Avarohanam in the correct sequential order 
"(eg.Maya malava gawla, Kalyaani, Sankarabhavanam etc.)."
"For a Janya raga, it is not necessary that it should contain all 7 swaras "
and may have its Arohanam / Avarohanam in the sequential order
"(eg. Mohana, Hamsadhwani, Sree ragam etc.)."
With  regard  to  the  7  swaras  as  mentioned  above
please  also understand that these 7 swaras are extended to make 12 more swaras and named 'Dwadasa swaras'
"with two different versions (minor & major) of swaras ri, ga, ma, dha and ni with just one sa and pa (as these two are basic swaras)."
List  of  Dwadasa  swaras  are  as  given  below.
These  used  in different variations of combinations make up the 72 Melakartha ragas
You can relate this easily if you look at the keys of an octave in a piano / harmonium.
" It's a fact, these 12 swaras together make an octave in all types of music everywhere."
"We will now learn about Raga, which is the core of Indian music."
A raga is a series of notes systematically arranged  which can bring out different experiences in a musician or a listener.
 The whole structure of Indian music is built around the concept of raga.
 Even folk melody songs are set in some raga or other.
 Some folk melodies are in mixed ragas
ie. one part of the stanza being in one raga and another stanza in another raga.
However  a combination of swaras which are pleasant to listen are known as ragas.
The Ragas are of two types especially in Carnatic music.
Janaka raga and Janya raga.
 This division of ragas into Janaka and Janya was given by Vidyaranya.
"A Janaka raga is also known as a Mela Raga, a Melakarta Raga,a Raganga Raga and a Sampoorna Raga."
There are totally 72 Janaka Ragas
Features of a Janaka raga
A Janaka raga has all the seven swaras in order in both the aarohana and the avarohana.
Example - Mayamalavagawla
It has only one variant of each swara.
The  variants  present  in  the  aarohana  are  present  in  the avarohana too.
Ragas derived from Janaka ragas are Janya ragas.
Features of a Janya raga
A Janya raga usually does not have all the seven swaras. It has either five or six swaras in the ascending scale/descending scale/both.
"Even if a Janya raga has all the seven swaras, the swaras are not in original order and/or the sequence of Swara will be different from the original."
Janya ragas are classified into the following groups
Upanga raga: A raga which has five or six notes in its ascending and/or descending scale(s) taken from its parent raga.
"Ex: Hamsadhwani (Derived from Dheerashankarabharana,the 29th Melakarta)."
Bhashanga  raga: A  raga  which  has  five  or  six  notes  in  its ascending and/or descending scale(s) taken from its parent raga 
"and one, two or three swaras not present in its parent raga."
"Ex: Bilahari (Derived from Dheerashankarabharana,the 29th Melakarta.Its Avarohana has the N3, but N2 is used in the raga too)."
"Upanga Vakra raga: The same as Upanga raga, but with the swaras not in order."
"Ex: Vasanta (Derived from Suryakanta, the 17th Melakarta)."
"Bhashanga Vakra raga: The same as Bhashanga raga, but with the swaras not in order."
"Ex: Ananda Bhairavi (Derived from Natabhairavi, the 20th Melakarta."
All Ragas are made up of the following components
Arohana  - A  set  of  notes  (scale)  used  to  play ascending melodies.
Avarohana - A scale used to play descending melodies.
"Vadi - This is the most important note in a raga (the tonic, in Western terminology)."
Samavadi - The second most important note (the dominant).
"Komal means soft and swar means ""note"""
"Any  of  what  western  theory  would  call  ""flattened""  notes included in the raga."
"Teevra Swar - Any ""sharpened"" notes included in the raga."
Varjita Swar - Any notes that should not be used when playing or composing using a particular raga.
Samaya - The  time of day when the raga would be played/sung.
Taal - A rhythm or beat associated with the particular raga.
To learn all these practically you need to go to a guru/teacher who is well-versed and also practice it daily.
Let us learn the basic components of the following Ragas

 You may see huge trees aged 100 years sometimes.
" They grow very tall in  some  forests,  while  in  some  other  cases,  the  trees  spread wide."
" The varieties and types of trees grown in different forests depend upon the nature of land, rain and other environmental conditions."
Have  you  ever  thought  who  waters  the  trees  and  plants  in the  deep  forests? 
"  Definitely  no governments,  NGOs,  private organizations  etc  water  them."
 They  grow  naturally  with  rain-water.
"Different  types  of  plants  and  trees  have  been  described  and classified in Ayurveda, health science and many texts."
Manu Smriti classifies the plants as
"Vrikshayurveda, medical book for plants, has different taxonomy to offer."
 What kind of treatment should be offered for plants have been discussed in detail in Vrikshayurved.
" It's not just enough to keep human beings alone, but animals, birds, plants or any other creatures  also should  be  looked  after."
  This  was  basic understanding of Bharateeyas.
" However, Indians have thought very deeply about the nature, forest, resources etc. to understand and support as much as possible."
In a Sanskrit Subhashita the importance of trees and plants is emphasized through this shloka
According to this shloka - There is no sound which cannot be turned into a Mantra and no plant without medicinal value.
" No man on the earth is useless, but each is rare and wise, capable of discovering and rightly 'employing' all things in the environment in the right manner."
Memorise this shloka and try to understand the importance of each plant.

"When we consider the cows to be very important part of farmer's life, we have to know how to look after them by feeding, cleaning, keeping them healthy, treating illness etc."
Keeping the cowshed (Goshala) clean and tidy helps a lot.
"A clean cowshed, keeps diseases away."
It make them healthy and it resulted in increased amount of healthy milk.
"So in this lesson, lets study about some simple ways to make Goshala clean."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
explain the importance of cleaning Goshalas
describe the maintenance of Goshala
explain the steps taken for cleaning process.
Goshalas are an important part of every households in rural India.
Our ancient texts are filled with praising Cows and their blessings on our life.
While emphasizing the importance of cow Rishis have said
"Let cows be before, behind and around me."
Let cows be in my heart.
Let me live in the midst of cows and  let them bless me.
"Often in India, the farmer's house is built with Soils bricks."
The entire  house  used  to  be  floored  with  Gomaya  (cow dung).
"However, this tradition is decreasing in many areas with the use of new building materials."
"It is said that cowdung has the ability to disinfect the space of its application from all kinds of harmful insects, germs, bacteria etc."
But it doesn't mean that we should not clean our Goshalas.
"Dirt, wastage such as remaining eatable of cows, cow dung, the grass and other things  layered on the floor make goshala dirty."
It reduces  the  hygiene  which  make  them  vulnerable  for  many diseases.
Keeping Goshalas clean is very important as it improves the health of cows.
Healthy cows may produce more milk with better quality.
Goshala (cowshed) is a place for the cows to relax and sleep during the night.
We all may have seen the goshala in our home or at our nearby places.
"Each cow has their own place in the resting area, called STHANA."
The Goshala may look different in different geographical areas because it is mostly prepared using local products available in the vicinity.
At some places the stone pillar are used for walls and grass is used for roof.
At some places we may see bricked walls with cement or tin sheet.
We should consider following important points while making a goshala
A  cow  needs  space  to  lie  down.
One  should  construct Gosthanas  enough  to  be  occupied  by  cows  most  of  the time.
Use appropriate products for making goshala walls.
"Stone Pillars, Brick Pillars, Wood Pillars, Unbaked brick walls, Baked brick walls or concrete walls may be used for wall making."
Good  air  flow  and  proper  lighting  must  be  managed  at Goshalas.
"If you are making bricks walls, create some holes on the walls for smooth flow of air."
"The Goshala must be covered with a roof made of iron sheets, grass thatch or concrete roof."
The roof must be high enough so that it cannot be eaten by a cow if it is made of grass or if hay is stored under it.
The shed should be constructed in such a way that the cow remains can be cleaned all the time.
Clean the cow shed every day.
"Very smooth floor may not be helpful for cows to stand, it may be very slippery"
so rough floor is ideal.
Dry leaves have to be spread on the rough floor for the cows to rest.
Clean and disinfect the floor every day.
This stops foot rot and abscesses.
Mark True or false
The entire house used to be floored with Gomaya (cow dung).
Our ancient texts are filled with praising Cows.
Good  air  flow  and  proper  lighting  are  not  required  at Goshalas.
Don't spread dry leaves on the rough floor for the cows to rest.
The Goshala must be covered with a roof.
Cleaning goshala is equally important.
Many of us are aware with the importance of cleaning goshalas.
"However, we don't know the exact and effective procedure to clean our goshalas."
Let us know the various steps used for making goshala clean and hygienic.
There should be adequate flow of air and light in the goshla.
It helps to keep it dry even in rainy seasons.
Dry materials are used to spread over the floor.
Collect the dry  materials  from  the  entire  floor  and  store  it  outside  the goshala.
"If  necessary,  use  minimal  water  to  wash  the  area  with broom or with pipe connection if bricks have been used for flooring."
The dry leaves spread on the ground should be removed along with cowdung to make organic manure.
Leave  the  cows  outside  for  grazing  for  sometimes.
"In earlier times, the cows were allowed to go into the forest for grazing."
"Once you remove the dry leaves or grass from the ground, easily the entire area becomes clean."
"The area in which the grass and cow eatables are placed, clean the area."
"In many areas, water is mixed with dry fodder alongwith wheat or oats flour."
In such cases remove the liquid remains everyday.
The waste material of the goshala should be collected at a separate place away from the goshala.
The cow dung should also be collected separately which can be used for Biogas.
"Mosquitoes, housefly and other insects are found in goshalas."
They make cows uncomfortable.
"Therefore, some fume by burning cow dung alongwith neem leaves may be used to keep them away from goshala."
These simple steps may be used for making goshala clean.
Keeping goshala clean and hygenic is very important.
Cows are an essential part of Indian society.
Goshalas are prepared mostly using locally available raw material.
It must have proper arrangements of air and light.
It should be clean every day.
Waste material should be kept seperately.
Explain the importance of cleaning goshalas.
Suggest any 4 points to maintain goshala.
Why it is necessary to remove dry leaves from floor.
Why we should create fumes in goshala?
Make a list of any 5 steps taken in cleaning goshalas.
In ancient times humans used to live along river banks.
"They live in rural areas, economy was agrarian and basic needs could be fulfilled directly from natural resources."
Most of the human activities were in harmony with nature and did not affect natural environment adversely.
"With passage of time, humans enhanced their knowledge and resultant in technological advancements"
"hence growing industrialization, population explosion and desire to live a comfortable life have degraded our natural environment because we are used to living in our environment."
Any change in the environment around us which is not favourable troubles us.
"There are some changes that are not suitable to life, and they pollute our environment."
Protection of environment is very essential.
"We should protect our air, water, soil and forests in order to conserve environment."
We also have to see that the balance between natural things and living beings is maintained.
We will discuss ancient traaditonal practices which was used in India  as remedy for pollution and waste.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
explain the types and causes of pollution
identify the traditional techniques for purifying environment
traditional practices to use waste material in domestic needs.
"Vedic scriptures also mentioned the occurrence of environmental pollution  including  air,  water  and  soil  pollution  because  of artificial equipments, machines and toxic unnatural substances (synthesized chemical)."
So human life involves a number of daily activities.
Bathing  and  washing  of  clothes  with  soaps  and detergents add some chemical residue to water and change its quality.
Cooking of food by using firewood may give out smoke in  the  air.
Agricultural  activities  may  dump  fertilizers  and pesticides in the environment in modern world.
The presence of unwanted substances in a concentration which can have an adverse effect on organisms and environment is called pollution.
"Depending upon the area or the part of environment affected, pollution may be of the five types"
We all feel and breathe air.
"Sometimes, we feel very happy and remark about the fresh air around us."
The pollution in air may not be noticed until we see dust or smoke coming out from some source or some foul smell present all around.
All human activities from cooking at home to the working of highly  mechanized  industries  contribute  to  air  pollution.
"pollution  is  the  introduction  of  harmful  chemicals,  biological wastes,  and  particulate  matter  into  the  atmosphere."
Pollution has  harmful  effects  on  humans  as  well  as  on  all  other  living beings
"Pollutant gases cause irritation in eyes, throat and lungs."
"Liver, kidney, spleen and nervous system too are affected."
Also causes gastroenteritis.
Heart  related  diseases  tend  to  increase.  Many people tend to develop terminal ailments such as cancer.
"Water  pollution  is  the  contamination  of  water  bodies  like lakes,  rivers,  ground  water  and  oceans."
It  occurs  due  to  the discharge of untreated pollutants into water bodies.
It not only affects plants and organisms living near the location of discharge but  also  travels  to  other  locations  through  transportation  of polluted water.
Various sources of water pollution are
Soil pollution is caused by the addition of chemicals or other unwanted substances in the natural soil environment.
"As you can see in the pictures, soil pollution results in land degradation."
Don't you think here again we humans are responsible for the increase in soil pollution.
Addition  of  substances  that  change  the  quality  of  soil  by making  it  less  fertile  and  unable  to  support  life  is  called soil pollution
"Domestic sources: plastic bags, kitchen waste, glass bottles and other solid waste."
"Industrial sources: chemical residue, fly ash, metallic waste."
Agricultural residues: fertilizers and pesticides 
Soil erosion also leads to the degradation of soil due to uprooting of plants and over-grazing.
"Noise can be simply defined as ""unwanted sound""."
It is generally higher in urban and industrial areas than in rural areas.
using heavy machinery are exposed to high noise levels for long period of work hours everyday.
Intensity of sound is measured in a unit called decibel or dB.
The lowest intensity of sound that human ear can hear is 10 dB.
"Look at the figure , some sources of noise pollution is seen there ."
Radiation is a form of energy travelling through space.
Radiation pollution is the increase in over the natural back ground radiation.
 There are many sources of radiation pollution
 nuclear wastes from nuclear plants 
mining and processing of nuclear material
the worse case of nuclear pollution was the Chernobyl disaster in Russia occurred in 1986 but the effects still longer today.
Define pollution.
Name different types of Pollution.
Name any two sources of water pollution.
Emphasis  was  given  to  respect  for  natures  and  concept  of environment harmony.
"Vedas, Puranas and great epics also learnt to respect tress and rivers, kindness to birds and animals and reverence for the presence of divinity in nature."
Atrharva veda instructs 'Apo Vata Ashadhayah' means air and water are sacred and  like natural medicines and so it is very important to keep clean and pure.
"Another  hymns  of  Rigveda  says  -  if  the  forests/plants  are destroyed, it will adversely affect the clean air "
 also the mineral wealth as trees and plants are also the saviors of the precious wealth contained inside the earth.
"Other religions too enshrine respect for nature and environmental protection rest (plants and trees), sunlight, morning atmosphere etc are referred as purifiers of environment."
The  Vedas  also  mention  about  the  ozone  layer  as  earth  is surrounded by a membrane which is very thick.
the function of this layer is to protect earth from harmful rays or radiations.
Yagya  (yajna)  is  a  scientific  process  of  sublimation  and transformation of healthy constituents of plants/herbal medicines into  vapor  phase  and  their  expansion  and  dissipation  in  the surrounding air.
"It also helps in maintaining balance of oxygen, carbon-dioxide "
also reducing the harmful growth of poisonous and ozone layer depleting gases and radiations etc.
Yagya  (yajna)  is  also  the  source  of  shower  of  water  and  air purifying  and  vital  elements  from  the  upper  layer  of  earth's atmosphere and space beyond.
"Fire ritual of yagya has power to remove  all  the  faults,  impurities  and  pollution  and  purifies everything around."
"It is also most effective eco-friendly methods of  removing  harmful  germs,  bacteria  and  other  carriers  of infections and diseases."
"It is mentioned in yajurveda, yagya best means of purification of environment, maintenance of ecological balance and healthy and happy survival and all round well beings of all living beings and plants and trees."
Control of water Pollution Water is a powerful medium of purification and also source of energy.
"A narration in Manu Smriti suggests that One should not cause urine, stool and cough in water."
"Anything which is mixed with thses unpious object, bold and poison, should not be thrown into water."
It means we should not pollute our water resources.
Vedic period people took precautions to use water free from all sorts of impurities 
and that great care was taken for an adequate supply of unpolluted water.
"They must have had a plentiful supply of  water  for  drinking,  cooking,  washing  and  other  purposes."
People of ancient and medieval India put great efforts to test and analyse different types of water collected in different places and in different seasons.
Susruta has explained the six types of pollutants and has given the ill-effects caused by consuming or using water with these doshas.
"He has prescribed a few substances like clearing nuts, gomedaka, lotus-bulbs, moss, pearls, thick cloth etc, with which impurities including suspended ones can be removed from water."
"Boiling, making sunlight fall on the water, adding fragrance by dropping flowers in the water, dropping red hot iron balls, sand, lump of mud(alum) in the water and allowing it to clear are some methods prescribed for purification of water."
Water heated by the sun's rays is considered to be very good like gangam water
"when heated by the sun, the bacteria etc. are destroyed "
"and when cooled in night, water becomes soft and light."
"If the water gets polluted and becomes pungent, bitter, tasteless, saline  or  malodorous,  it  is  advised  that  arjuns,  musta,  ustra, nagakesara, kosalaka, amalaka together with ketakaphala should be thrown in the water."
"This will male the foul water transparent, tasteful and fragrant and in addition will confer on it many other good qualities"

What is the best way to purify atmospheres in Vedic period
"Earth, water, fire, air ether mind and false ego all together these eight constitute my separated material energies."
Do not disturb the sky and do not pollute the atmosphere.
"Ancient India civilization always believed to live in harmony with  nature  and  traditionally  toned  hygienic  environment  as described  in  Vedas,  Upnishads,  Smiritis  and  Dharamstras."
Worshipping nature as deity and recognizing earth as mother as they are the basic necessities of human kind to exist on earth shows a kind of conservation ethics.
"From our ancient literatures and  kautila's Arthshastra,  it  was  mentioned  that  maintaining sanitation of habitat was essential and inevitable."
India was rural and pastural and even Rigveda there is no mention urban life.
Later on some examples are seen in Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.
The  sanitization  and  waste  management  techniques  spread through trade route around India.
Drainage systems are considered as a corner stone of urbanism development in the history of  India.
 Recent excavations at Harappa have shown to have flushed toilets in almost every house and were linked to the respective  city's central drainage network and the solid waste was discharged into a rectangular  jar soak pit for collection .
The waste management techniques used in ancient India were successful enough to recycle the household wastage.
Burning of wood or coal was used for cooking purpose and the carbon was decomposed underground.
Used to consume freshly prepared food so no packaging was done to pollute the environment.
Villagers  dug  a  small  hole  in  the  backyard  to  collect  daily household waste and covered it with mud/sand till pit got levelled.
"After a few months, this land was used in the farms as compost."
Some big holes were made near a big tree and the waste was collected  in  it.
The  waste  contents  were  mixed  with  the  mud during  watering  of  the  tree  and  were  slowly  converted  into compost.
"Returning of food waste to soil was a common practice since  vedic  times,  sustainably  recycling  nutrients  and micronutrients."
The real problem of waste started through the invention of plastic in the name of modernization.
The most favoured waste management is prevention and the least favoured is disposal of waste by storing or burying waste.
Reuse and recycling of waste material is an effective way of reducing air  pollution  
"Segregation of waste, pre-treatment at source, sterilization of rooms will help in checking indoor pollution."
Disposal of waste should be done in a scientific way.
"Vedic  scriptures  also  mentioned  the  occurrence  of environmental  pollution  including  air,  water  and  soil pollution "
"because of artificial equipments, machines and toxic 'unnatural substances."
The  presence  of  unwanted  substances  in  a  concentration which  can  have  an  adverse  effect  on  organisms  and environment is called pollution.
All human activities from cooking at home to the working of highly mechanized industries contribute to air pollution.
"Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies like lakes, rivers, ground water and oceans"
Soil pollution is caused by the addition of chemicals or other unwanted substances in the natural soil environment 
 Arharva veda  instructs 'Apo Vata Ashadhayah' means air and water are sacred and like natural medicines 
and so it is very important to keep clean and pure.
Reuse and recycling of waste material is an effective way of reducing air pollution 
"Reduce, Reuse, Repair and Recycle be our guiding principles for reducing waste generation."

" A shovel is a tool for digging, lifting, and moving bulk materials  such as soil, coal, gravel etc."
It is a hand tools consisting with a broad blade fixed to a medium-length handle.
Shovel blades are usually made of sheet steel or hard plastics and are very strong.
Shovel handles are usually made of wood.
This is a multipurpose garden maintenance tool
"it is a rake, shovel and soil sift in one."
"This lightweight tool is ideal for breaking up soil and clods, mix fertilizer, smooth out soil clearing up weeds or fallen autumn leaves and much more."
" They are used to make rows, furrows, seed holes, cover seeds, till soil and cut and remove weeds"
"Loppers  are  a  type  of  scissors  used  for  pruning  twigs  and small  branches,  like  secateurs  with  very  long  handles."
They are  the  largest  type  of  manual  garden  cutting  tool.
"They  are usually  operated  with  two  hands,  and  with  handles  typically between 30 centimetres and  91 centimetres long to give good leverage."

Buckets used for transporting water etc.
Watering Cans used  for watering of plants
 A garden hose is essential for carrying water to the garden.
Hoses are usually made from rubber or vinyl
rubber is more expensive.
Make sure the hose is long enough to reach comfortably to all parts of the garden.
Start by washing the dirt off your tools with a garden hose by scrubbing with a wire brush.
Dip the tools in a diluted solution of any household bleach.
Turpentine can be used for any items that might be covered in sap and vinegar can be used to soak items coasted in rust.
Rub wooden handles with linseed oil.
"Hoes, shears, scissors, knives, loppers, prunes, and shovels all need to be sharpened sometime and regularly."
Store Tools  in  a  clean  dry  place  after  cleaning  and wiping them
Determine the type of soil you have and plan to get the required mix.
Clay soil will hold water but does not drain well.
It is usually highly alkaline and will need a lot of organic matter added to it.
Sandy soil will drain well but requires frequent watering.
It will also need to be improved with organic material.
Very organic soil is usually highly acidic and will have both good drainage and moisture retention.
You may need to add lime to increase the pH level.
Add  plenty  of  organic  material  to  your  soil  before  you plant.
Dig and aerate your soil each season.
""
Check your soil for good drainage by digging a hole
 a foot deep (30cm) and filling it with water.
The water should drain out in around 15 minutes.
If it takes much longer or drains too fast the may need to take steps to rectify it.
Buy seeds of a reputable seed company.
You can select seed available at your home also.
Choose a variety that will do well in your climate.
When selecting seeds ensure that they free of the following:
Timing is important- not too cold and wet to sow
"Temperature matters - As a rule, the seed of most (but not all) Notes species germinates best in gentle heat."
"Moisture is important - As a rule, most seeds' germination and growth depends on keeping the soil just slightly damp to the touch."
Humidity is important for successful germination.
Light levels matter.
"Depth and spacing matter - Sowing seed too deeply is a classic beginner's mistake, as is sowing too densely."
Consider the space available to grow.
Plants need space to grow and to promote health with airflow to reduce disease like mildew and blight.
"If you have a small garden, look for bush, compact or container varieties to grow."
Water the plants regularly.
"In the summer season, you need to water them at least once every day."
Plants lose a lot of water during this summer and they can wither or have stunted growth if they are not well watered.
With regard to the amount of water to use one needs to consider the species of the flowers and their water requirements.
Other factors that you can consider are the type of soil in the garden and the amount of rainfall in the area.
Excess watering and poor watering methods can cause fungal diseases on plants.
"Garden  soils  lose  fertility  with  time,  subjecting  plants  to inadequate nutrients."
"When you notice signs of low soil fertility, you need to immediately apply appropriate fertilizers."
The best fertilizers for flowers are the water-soluble or liquid ones.
Some fertilizers can scorch plants 
when used incorrectly like when high amounts are used or when applied at the wrong time.
"To avoid this problem, follow the manufacturer's directions for the fertilizer."
Perform  a  soil  test  to  help  pick  the  correct  fertilizer.
Organic fertilizers  take  longer  to  release  in  the  soil
but they create a healthier soil over time.
Mulch  is  any  material  that  is  spread  or  laid  over  the  surface of  the  soil  as  a  covering.
"It  is  used  to  retain  moisture  in  the soil, suppress weeds, keep the soil cool, prevent soil erosion and adds nutrients to the soil"
"Organic mulches also help improve the soil's fertility, as they decompose."
For  mulches  choose the  ones  that  do  not  spoil  the  beauty  of  the  plants.
"Some recommended mulches include grass, leaves, wood chips, and polythene papers."
Weeds compete for nutrients available in the soil and the with useful plants.
Besides they can harbor pests and diseases.
"to get the best from your flowers, you need to remove any weeds that grow in your garden."
"If you are growing flowers in a smaller garden or using pots and vases, you can control weeds by just uprooting them."
"For a larger garden, you need to use garden tools like a hoe and pick"
you need to weed after every week.
"Sunlight is the source of energy in plants, and so you need to ensure  that  the  plants  are  getting  enough  of  it."
"Some  flowers need many hours of sunlight every day while others, like the indoors, need just a few hours."
So you need to know the light requirements of your plants in order to provide them with enough light.
"Pests can easily kill  plants, so it is important to prevent them from attacking the garden."
"You can prevent some pests by keeping the garden free from weeds, refuse and  by installing barriers and traps."
"Some pests that you should be aware of include bugs, mites, aphids, whiteflies, and gnats."
"If  plants  are  attacked  by  pests,  one  needs  to  use  appropriate pesticides to kill the harmful organisms."
"Like  pests,  diseases  are  quite  harmful  to  flowers."
"Most  plant diseases  are  caused  by  fungi,  bacteria,  and  viruses."
you can  prevent  fungal  diseases  by  avoiding  excessive  use  of water in your garden and by using clean weeding and pruning tools.
"Some animals, like cows and goats can destroy plants by feeding on  the  foliage."
Other  animals  like  dogs  and  cats  can  also  be destructive on garden plants.
The best way to protect your garden from animals is to install a barrier.
Pinching is the process of removing stem tips to encourage lateral growth and promote good shape.
It is recommended to pinch back  plants to increase branching and promote the formation of more flowers.
Thinning is the process of removing excess plants to create room for the growth of the remaining plants.
"On the other hand, culling is the process of removing undesirable plants (inferior, weak, infested or diseased) to give more room for the remaining plants or to control pests and diseases."
Staking is done to provide support for plant stems.
It involves fixing a stake or rod in the ground and tying a stem on it.
done on plants with weak stems or where plants are required to grow in a certain direction
Deadheading is the process of removing old or dead flower heads from a plant to encourage more blooming.It can also keep the plants looking tidy.
Soils  lose  their  physical  properties  with  time
lowering their capacity to sustain plant growth so it needs to be replaced
Organic manures are composed of dead plant and animal remains and contain plant nutrients.
They are applied to the soil to increase crop production.
"In the farms manures from cow or buffalo dung, compost  made  from  plants,  leaves  and  kitchen  waste,  and leguminous crops used as green manures"
Maintains soil fertility level.
Increases  the  nutrient  level  of  the  soil  by  improving  soil structure and aeration.
Helps to retain plant nutrients and moisture.
Well-decomposed compost buffers soil reaction and controls soil temperature.
Increases soil microbial activity which helps mineralization of applied chemical fertilizers
making them more available to crops.
Arrange composting material in a pit or heap.
"If composting is done in a heap, the site should be levelled and protected from rain by a roof so that nutrients will not drain off."
Compost is decomposed by fungi and bacteria.
"For proper microbial growth, add starter materials like wood ash."
"Add enough water to keep compost moist; the material should be spongy - not too dry, not too wet."
Turn the compost pit or heap at 30-40 day intervals for proper aeration.
Cover the compost pit or heap with mud or straw or plastic sheets.
This practice enhances decomposition.
Crumbly
Does not stick in the hand.
Dark grey or blackish in color 
Original material cannot be distinguished
One can find many job opportunities or get self employed in Horticultue.
"Horticulture is the branch of agriculture that deals with  the  art,  science  and  business  of  plant  cultivation."
This includes plants that are edible and ornamental.
"It also includes conservation  of  plants,  restoration,  landscape,  design  and construction."

A tailor is a person who cuts and sews fabrics to make garments.
Sewn garments can further decorated be with embroidery also.
Can you imagine stitching without needle and thread? Or cutting without scissors?.
No it is impossible
Do you have any idea of the steps involved in dress making.
"Garment construction involves many steps like cutting, stitching and finishing etc."
so we require many tools and equipments.
In this lesson you will learn about the tools used in sewing and some basic hand stitches 
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
identify and list the different tools used for hand stitching and embroidery
use the basic hand stitches to sew and repair garments
work and use the decorative stitches to decorate an item of clothing
appreciate the scope of basic tailoring.
"Tailoring is the art of designing, cutting, fitting, and finishing clothes."
A tailor depends upon his tools.
He requires a few tools.
"They  are-  a  pair  of  scissors,  a  sewing  machine,  a  measuring tape, a sharp needle, a thimble on his middle finger, some thread reels and balls, and an iron press."
"A tailor is someone who sews, joins, or finishes clothing or other items. They may create new pieces  of  clothing  from  patterns  and  designs  or  alter  existing garments to fit customers better."
Tailoring includes the following activities
Measuring clients to ensure that clothing will fit properly
Cut and measure fabric according to a pattern or design
"Sew clothing by hand, using a needle and thread or with sewing machines"
Finish  and  decorate  the  garments  using  trimmings  and embroidery 
"A basic knowledge of stitching/ hand stitching with needle can help us to handle small repair like tears, loose/lost buttons or hooks."
You could also decorate and make a simple dress look expensive and beautiful by embroidering it.
Every craft requires its specific tools and equipment.
Let us list and study some of the basic tools of stitching by hand.
Scissors—You will need them to cut your fabric and thread.
Measure Tape—You will need them to take measurements.
Needles  and  Threader—Needles  are  used  to  sew  and embroider.
They  are  available  in different  sizes  (Numbers).
They are chosen in accordance with the thickness of the fabric.
The  threader  helps  make  the  threading  of  the  needle  easy and quick.
Thimble—The thimble is worn on your middle fingertip to protect it while you push your needle.
Threads—You can't sew without threads! 
The most used are cotton or polyester
Rulers—They are used for taking straight measurements
Pressing while sewing makes the sewing neater and easier.
The Sprayer is used to moisten the fabric to be ironed to help give a neat finish
"It  is  used  to  cut/rip  out  seams,  to  open buttonholes etc."
It is used to transfer pattern markings to the fabric by leaving a fine imprint on smooth fabrics.
Study the table given below and fill in the columns as required.
Hand sewing needles are available in all kinds of shapes and forms.
"In most cases, the larger the size number, the smaller the needle."
Finer needles are used with thin or delicate fabrics while heavier needles are used with thicker fabrics.
There are tips and tricks that can help make threading a needle less difficult.
"For example, place a white background behind the needle to make it easier to see the eye and thread."
Cut the thread with sharp scissors (to prevent frayed ends) at a 45-degree angle.
"Be sure to stiffen the thread using water, saliva, or wax."
"If you still have difficulty, use a needle threader."
"Hold  both  the  needle  threader  and  needle  in  one  hand,  while keeping the loop of wire on the needle threader through the eye of the needle."
Insert your threadthrough the loop of wire on the needle threader.
Pull the thread through the loop so that you have a tail of least a few inches in length.
"Place the end of the thread on your pointer finger, holding it in place with your thumb."
Wrap the thread around your pointer finger a couple of times.
"Using your thumb, slide the thread loops towards the end of your pointer finger."
The loops will wrap around each other as they travel toward the end of your pointer finger.
"Slide the loose knot to the end of the tread, then tug on the thread to tighten the knot."
"The running stitch is the most basic of the hand sewing stitches, and has many variations."
"It's used for gathering, mending, and tucking."
"Depending on its use, you an either knot your thread or take a couple of back stitches to lock it into place."
"In its longer form, it becomes a basting stitch."
Bring your needle through the fabric from the back (wrong side).
"Once the knot hits the fabric, make a stitch to the left or right."
Bring the thread back up and repeat.
"Uneven Basting Use the same technique as the running stitch, but make longer stitches (between 1/4 inch and a 1/2 inch)."
" Before  sewing  machines,  all  clothes  were  stitched  using backstitches."
"Working from left to right, take a small stitch, then insert the needle at the end of the previous stitch"
bringing it out beyond the point where the thread emerges.
"Continue, always inserting the needle in the end of the previous stitch."
Fasten thread with needle pointing to the left (right) take up a very small bit of the garment fabric just above the fold of the hem.
Try to make your stitch very small as it will be visible from the right side.
Pull up thread.
"Move the needle a bit to the right (left) - about 1/4"" to 1/2""."
Take up a small amount of the hem fabric with the needle still facing to the left (right).
Continue to complete hem.
You can use this stitch to finish hems with fabric that doesn't fray.
"Working from left to right, take tiny stitches on the hem, and then on the garment. Keep the stitches loose and even."
They will appear as crosses on the wrong side and small stitches on the right.
This is a tiny and almost invisible
"when it's done right, and with care on both sides."
Bring the needle through the fold of the hem and pick up a thread of fabric at the same point. Make the stitches about a 1/2 inch apart and fairly loose.
Fasten the thread on the wrong side of the fabric
"then with the right side facing upward, insert the needle from back to front through the fabric 1/8 inch from the edge."
"Wrap the working head around behind the eye end of the needle, then behind the point."
"Pull the needle through, bringing the knot to the fabric edge."
Continue the process
Until making closely spaced stitches and knot.
"The eyelet version( See above) is worked in a circle, with the wrapped edge to the inside."
This blanket stitch variation has at least a 1/4 inch spacing between stitches.
This stitch got its name from being used to create flower stems and it is  good for working curved lines.
Start  by  creating  one  straight  stitch  forward.
"Then,  bring  the needle and thread up underneath the fabric, but instead of going through the center of your initial stitch, go just to the side of the stitch."
"When you're filling in leaves, it's likely you want the design to have a smooth appearance."
"This stitch adds a nice raised texture, and gets the job of filling the big area quickly."
"First, draw out the shape you want to fill to use as a guide."
"With your needle and thread , create one stitch that extends from one end of the shape to the other."
Bring the needle up again just next to the opposite side of the initial stitch.
"Keep the stitches close to one another, as required to fill the pattern or design you are working with."
"First, bring the needle and thread up through the fabric."
Then wrap the thread around the needle twice.
Hold the end of the thread taut and bring the needle down just next to the space where it came through the fabric.
Keep holding the thread taut as you pull the needle through.
You can vary the size of your French knots by wrapping the thread around the needle anywhere between one and three times.
"First, pull your needle and thread up through the fabric"
then insert it going down right beside where you first came up.
Don't pull the thread all the way through the fabric; allow it to form a loop.
Bring the needle up through that loop (this holds it from being pulled all the way through the fabric) and pull.
"To make the next chain stitch, place the needle either directly in the hole you just stitched"
"or close to it, and pull through to create another loop."
"Again, don't pull the thread completely through the fabric. Pull the needle up through the loop to hold it and pull."
Repeat the steps to continue the chain.
"When you reach the end, create a small stitch over the loop to secure it."
"This  variation  of  the  chain  stitch  is  often  referred  to  as  the ""detached chain stitch"" or ""lazy daisy."""
"Just like the chain stitch, take your needle and thread and create a stitch, but before you pull the thread all the way through the fabric, allow it to form a loop."
Bring the needle up through that loop in order to tether it from being pulled all the way through the fabric.
Create a small stitch over the top of the loop.
Space out the next loop or use the stitch to create a daisy.
Continue as desired.
"Another way to work the chain stitch is the feather stitch, which uses the second stitch to fasten the loop of the previous one."
This particular chain variation works well when you want to cover more space.
Start by bringing the needle and thread up through the fabric and creating a straight stitch.
Don't pull the thread all the way through; allow a loop to form and bring the needle up through that loop.
Space  the  next  stitch  over  in  the  opposite  direction  from  the previous stitch.
Create another loop by not allowing the thread to go completely through the fabric.
Pull the needle up through the loop and repeat on the opposite side.
"Bring the needle up in the bottom left hole, reinsert it at the top right to create a diagonal stitch."
"Bring the needle back up directly below its current position, in the next hole down."
Take it back through the fabric in the diagonal hole to the right.
Continue in this way across the row.
"To complete the stitches on the journey back, bring the needle up in the bottom right and take it back down through the top left hole to make the cross."
"when working this stitch, mark parallel lines using a pencil."
"Working left to right, bring the needle up through the fabric at the lower left (point 1) and work a stitch diagonally to the upper right (point 2)."
"Bring the needle up again to the left of the insertion hole (point 3), and then work a stitch diagonally to the lower right (point 4)."
"Come back up to the left of this (point 5), which becomes the new point ."
"(point 1), so you are ready to repeat to the end of the row"
Two important factors to keep in mind are
Button placement
Button attachment technique
"For a flat button, start by sewing an ""X"" on the fabric where you want to place the button."
Sew up and down through the holes in the button several times.
"On the final pass, bring your needle and  thread  only  up  under  the  button."
Wrap  the  thread  tightly around the base of the button a few times.
Pass the needle through this bundle a time or two.
Then bring the needle back to the back side of the fabric.
Stitch through the stitches to form a loop and make a knot.
A buttonhole should be long enough so the button can slip easily through  the  hole  without  strain  or  excessive  wear.
Normally length of the buttonhole should be equal to the diameter of the button  plus  thickness  of  the  button .
Decide upon your buttonhole placement.
Mark your fabric with a common pin.
Measure the size of your button
Cut a tiny slit in your fabric
Stitch around the opening of the buttonhole.
"Using double thread, stitch a tight blanket stitch. Place one stitch close next to another"
Thread a hand sewing needle and knot the thread.
Use a double thread unless the fabric is very thin.
Sew the holes on the end of the hook to the fabric
sew using simple in and out loops of thread or sew with a buttonhole/blanket stitch.
A minimum of six pieces of thread on each part of the hook and the eye is advisable.
More or less can be used depending on the strength of the thread.
Sew the neck of the hook to the fabric to keep the hook laying on the fabric.
Sew a couple of tack stitches to end the sewing.
Knot the thread and cut the thread.
Lay the garment flat and position the eye so the garment lies flat with the eye in the hook.
Sew the metal loops to the fabric in the same manner that you sewed the hook.
"On a loop eye, sew the loop down to the fabric at the end of the fabric, if the loop exceeds the edge of the fabric."
Eyelets are small round holes punched in the goods and worked around over and over.
"Thread  a  sewing  needle  with  a  double  or  single  thread, depending on the weight of the fabric."
Fasten the thread at the desired end of the eye location.
Create a loop by bringing the needle down into the opposite desired end of the eye.
Repeat to have four to six strands of thread bar.
"Bring the needle to the top of the fabric, at one end of the bar."
"Wrap the thread bar, creating a thread loop that the thread is brought through, similar to a blanket stitch"
repeating this process to cover and secure the thread bar.
"After covering the entire thread bar, fasten the thread at the end of the thread loops."
A snap fastener (also called press stud) is a pair of interlocking discs commonly used in place of buttons to fasten clothing.
A circular lip under one disc fits into a groove on the top of the other
holding them fast until a certain amount of force is applied.
Stitch through the holes at the edges of the snap using simple loops or blanket stitch.
"when working with needles, pins and knitting needles"
"Keep needles and pins at a certain place (a special box, cushion, etc.)"
"do not leave them at the workplace, never take the needle, pins in your mouth and do not stick them in the clothes."
Keep your eyes on the needle.
Be safe while ironing.
Make sure your nails are trimmed and hands washed.
Use appropriate cutting tools.
Handle scissors with caution.

"India is a country with a lot of diversity in its Terrain, languages, religions, climate and therefore clothing and in food too."
Food in our multicultural society has been known to bring together all religions and cultures.
"Food therefore finds an important place at  almost  all  occasions  be  it  a  wedding,  birthday,  a  religious occasion, pooja, at meetings,"
"Food  is  offered  to  our family,  friends  and  colleagues  when  we  meet."
We  cook  food differently in different cultures 
food is cooked according to the availability of ingredients available in that particular region.
Once the food is cooked it is brought to the persons who will consume it which we call 'Serving'.
How food is served in India differs from culture to culture and region to region.
It is necessary to know how we can serve the food that is cooked to the guests
For example we know that in the southern and eastern states of India rice is the staple food
while in northern India roti or chapati is the staple food
this is mainly because these regions have climate suitable for growing these food grains.
Rice  items  will  therefore  be  served  very differently than serving a chapati.
Foods of India are  known for its spiciness.
"Throughout our country, spices are used generously in food that make it more palatable."
Cooked food may be served fresh or packed for carrying with the person who will consume it.
In the past few years we have developed a culture of selling the food too in packaged forms.
Food industry is one of the flourishing and profitable propositions for business today.
"Traditionally food in India was eaten while seated either on the floor or on very low stools, durries or mattresses."
Most often food was eaten with the hands using ones fingers.
"Let us understand why serving food is important, how we can serve food keeping in with our Indian tradition and also study about the traditional utensils that are used to prepare or serve food."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
explain  the  importance  of  serving  food
"different  types  of  service, serving food at home and outside"
identify various traditional utensils used for serving food
serve food systematically.
Serving of food is the stage between cooking and eating 
"and involves important roles, mannerisms, and cultural forms depending upon the traditional practices of the community to which the people belong."
Different communities have different practices
for example-we have seen that Indians emphasize on serving food with love and offering second helpings too.
Serving of food may also depend upon where and how the food is had or offered
"for example food may be had at home, restaurant, office, picnic, school etc."
 Define Serving of Food.
 Give an example of how food is served at your house.
Food may be packaged and sent to individuals from one place to another .
"like our famous dabbawalas of Mumbai, it may be served to children in schools during the midday meal or may be served in front of the dinners in a restaurant or may be served to the families at home"
Serving at a hotel may be from a Kitchen from where food is carried to a side table or a trolley.
"Food is served to the persons or the persons may serve themselves from the serving utensils containing food, from the Cooking utensils."
In a restaurant the guests sit at a table with family and friends and are served food by the waiters from the restaurant.
"In restaurants food may be served/ordered à la carte, that is, the diners  may  choose  items  from  a  menu  or  the  food  could  be arranged in a Buffet and the guests could serve themselves from the food arranged on large common tables."
""
""
When food is laid out  on  large  common  tables  so  that  the  guests  can  serve themselves is called a Buffet arrangement.
buffet-Is a meal at which food is placed on a long table a people serve themselves.
In some Indian households women have often been seen serving children and men first
"Food  at  home  may  be  served,  like  we  mentioned  above,  at  a table or to the people sitting on the floor in many households."
 many Indian families use cutlery such as spoons or forks etc for eating 
but many also do not use any cutlery and use their hands to eat food.
The type of cutlery used is chosen based on  the  type  of  food  that  we  eat.
"Since  Indian  food  comes  in different shapes, sizes and textures"
we often prefer to use all our fingers to eat food 
"in order to enjoy the taste, smell, sight and touch of food."
"When the individual sits on the floor, the food may be served  on leaves, Thalis etc "
at many places food may also be served on a long table.
"We  are  aware  that  our  ancestors  cooked  food  in  earthenware because there would have been no plastic, steel or aluminium "
also science has proven that cooking in Matkas or clay pots adds several minerals to food thereby making food healthy 
"by doing this, food is made free from contamination of undesirable metals."
Clay pots are also alkaline in nature 
so they mix well with acidic food and balance its pH level.
These utensils keep the liquids cool in warm areas.
"Small bowls may be used to make curd, kulfi and also serve in them."
Earthern kullads which are environment friendly 
they are  used to serve water or tea.
Leaves are used for serving food which has been the practice from ancient times.
Fresh leaves even today are used as a plate for eating.
This is a common practice in many parts of our country such as in south and west India.
A large number of people from southern states use Banana leaves as they are easily available
these leaves are large and thick
they can easily serve as a plate.
In north India food or very often prasad may be served in donaas or pattals
these pattals are made of dried leaves.
This is mainly because banana leaves are found in abundance in the southern India as compared with  north.
Nowadays  however  plates  and  bowls  made  from thermocol  or  plastic  are  used  
which are not safe for our environment 
as they are not biodegradable.
"Examples of common leaves that may be used are Plantain leaf, Bastard teak leaf, Ricinus communis leaf, Calotropis leaf, Castor leaf, Secrete milky sap leaf, Lotus petals, Tahitian screwpine leaf, Stereospermum suaveolens leaf etc."
The order and type of foods served in a banana leaf varies from culture to culture.
The banana leaf is placed in a way that the broader side comes on the right.
"Things that are less used like as salt and on the right are usually gravy, rice, curd ,pickle and curry that are more requently accessed.  "
Gravy items are served on the top side away from the diner. Dry items such as Rice and papad are usually served on the bottom side.
Serving food on a plate also begins from the left hand and moves to the right.
"We have often seen that items such as salt, lemon, chutney raita and pickle that are eaten in less quantity are placed on the left side, right side usually has dry vegetables and in the centre are placed rice or rice items."
Gravy items are generally served in small bowls or katoris.
 Food from the Midday Meal kitchens in each area are brought to different schools
it is prepared fresh in school  in the morning.
"The food that is dal rice, chana, poorie alu, etc are served to children who either sit in rows on mats or line up in front of the person who ladles out the food into their lunch boxes."

"We have often seen them made from clay, aluminium, iron etc."
"We can also make paratha, chela or dosa on the tava."
A tava is made from thick iron

Drawing is one of the most basic ways to exercise your creativity.
the skills you gain from the activity translate to a bevy of different media.
"for this you can use  a  pencil,  pen,  crayon,  or  even  your fingers"
"Learning the fundamentals is simple to do, but like all art, they require a lot of practice to master."
"But once you do, you'll have the ability create images you're truly proud of."
There are standard drawing techniques
that you need to be familiar with as you put pencil to paper.
Some are so basic that you've probably used them before without even realizing it.
"In this  lesson  you  will  learn  about  the  basic  skills  of  drawing, drawing of shapes like circles and also understand the basics of colour."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
list the basic equipments used for drawing
explain the basic skills of drawing
"draw basic shapes such as circle, triangle, square etc."
create new colours by mixing two or more colours.
Most of us started drawing when we were young.
"Back then, materials  and  tools  were  not  that  important  to  us."
"A  standard pencil on some notebook paper would often ""do the trick""."
Some essential tools of drawng are listed blow.
They are graded from hard (H) to soft (B).
9H is the hardest 
9B is the softest
with F (for fine) and HB in the middle range.
"H pencils (2H, 3H, and 4K; they progressively become harder) are good for clear-cut, light lines, but will scratch into the surface of your paper"
"so B pencils are better for softer, tonal work."
Each grade of pencil will only produce a tone of a given darkness 
and no amount of pressure will make that tone darker.
"If you require a darker tone, you will need to switch to a softer grade of pencil. Soft pencils will give a greater range of tones than hard pencils "
and can be erased easily
without leaving an indent should you make a mistake.
It is for this reason that most drawings are made using a pencil which is HB or softer.
Coloured pencils are made in much the same way as graphite pencils.
The pigment is mixed with a clay filler and a binder.
Wax  is  added  to  act  as  a  lubricant  and  help  the  pencil  slide smoothly over the paper.
These are available in many different colours and forms.
"Some coloured pencils make sharp, definite lines"
while others are softer and can be blended more easily.
Layering colours will produce different shades and unexpected results can be achieved by using the same group of colours in different sequences
"as the name suggests, are made of charcoal and wax"
"provide fuller blacks than graphite pencils, but tend to smudge easily "
and are more abrasive than graphite
  Your standard eraser for erasing graphite.
This eraser uses friction to remove any material from the surface.
inks  available  in  a  range  of  colours
are either water-soluble or waterproof 
Water-soluble inks are not as widely available as waterproof inks.
Both inks can be blended with water to create tones.
A sketchbook is one of the most important things 
an artist can have  a book with blank pages of drawing paper.
Since  a  sketchbook is recommended for daily practice
it is important to choose one that is durable and has plenty of pages.
"Paper can be purchased as loose, single sheets or in sketchbooks and pads."
Single sheets enable you to try out several different papers 
and can be cut or torn to size according to your need
"If you are working on single sheets of paper, you will need to secure it to a drawing board."
"It might sound obvious, but make sure that the board is large enough for your paper and that its surface  is  smooth."
"An  easel  is  an  upright  support  used  for displaying and/or fixing something resting upon it, "
"In particular, easels are traditionally used by painters to support a painting while they work on it,"
"normally standing up, and are also sometimes used to display finished paintings."
Easel is put at an angle of about 20° to the vertical.
Pencils need to be sharpened with a quality pencil sharpener.
Charcoal pencils can be sharpened like graphite pencils.
Metal sharpeners work better than plastic ones.
You can also use a small knife to sharpen your pencils  8.
Felt tip pens allow the artist to create a variety of marks.
this allows the artist to create a broad range of line quality.
 this pencil are made of charcoal 
"and provide fuller blacks than graphite pencils,"
but tend to smudge easily and are more abrasive than graphite.
A very large range of pen options is available-so much so that it may seem a little overwhelming.
Technical pens are convenient to use for fast sketches
 their nibs make unvarying marks.
"Fountain  or  cartridge  pens,  roller-ball,  ballpoint,  fine  liners, and specialist art pens come with a wide range of nibs "
"All pens can create fine, flowing lines"
Drawing is both a talent and a skill.
It takes a lot of practice to become  good  at  something.
A  skill  is  something  taught  and learned
" through levels of learning, you develop expertise."
A talent is an inborn and natural inherent ability.
""
The ability to draw will come naturally for some people
their natural ability can be enhanced by further training and developing higher skill.
"For someone  who  does  not  know  how  to  draw,  they  can  gain instruction and develop skill, even to a high level of expertise."
Some basic skills of drawing are:
The First Skill: recognizing edges
"The Second Skill: recognizing - non-object shapes or ""spaces"""
"The Third - and most difficult skill - sighting, perspective"
The Fourth Skill: Judging Light and Dark
"Applied to drawing, these skills specifically become the ability to:"
"identify edges,"
"recognize spaces,"
"calculate proportions and angles,"
"judge light from shadow, and"
"the unconscious skill of ""putting it all together""."
Drawing is one of the most basic ways to exercise your creativity.
"Whether you're using a pencil, pen, crayon, or even your fingers, the skills you gain from these activity translate into a great artist."
Learning the fundamentals is simple to do
but  they require a lot of practice to master.
"But once you do, you'll have the ability create images you're truly proud of."
There are standard drawing techniques that you need to be familiar with as you put pencil  to  paper.
Some  are  so  basic  that  you've  probably  used them before without even realizing it.
The basic craft of drawing is about two things
you learn to control your hand and  to see.
Let us begin
"This approach challenges you to move your drawing tool back and forth across the paper in an even, level motion."
"Depending on how much pressure you apply, the darker your drawing will appear."
Hatching involves making tiny ticks on your page.
Make sure that each mark is parallel to the other.
"Lines that are close  together  will  look  darker,  while  lines  further  apart  will indicate  highlights."
Now  make  sure  to  try  other  directions  as well.
This  technique  is  the  logical  extension  to hatching.
"But instead of creating a series of parallel lines, have your marks intersect one another in a cross-like formation."
Scribbling allows your hand the opportunity to fly across the page.
Move your pencil in a random formation-no precise marks necessary.
"The more you scrawl all over an area, the darker it will look."
 It involves making a countless amount of tiny dots on your paper.
"Like all other approaches, the closer the dots, the darker the drawing."
"If you're using charcoal or pencil, try blending them."
"To do so, begin with the back-and-forth technique to cover your paper, and then rub the medium into it."
You can use your finger or cloth.
Another option for blending is to experiment with powdered graphite and use a paintbrush to gradually blend and build tone onto your pages.
Lines are among the most fundamental features of any drawing.
Your ability to position lines on your paper will affect the end result of your masterpiece in one way or another.
"In essence, your drawings begin with simple lines to create the guides"
rough sketches that will serve as foundation to what you're about to draw.
By understanding straight lines and mastering how to draw them
you'll realise that there's more to them than simple sticks.
You'll understand the illusion and movement they seem to create when placed with each other in a certain distance and in a certain position.
Experiment  with  curved  lines  and  you'll understand about graceful movements and fluffy figures.
"Mastering your straight and curved lines, you'll understand that combining some of them into a single pattern "
will provide you with magical results that you may have not expected.
 Connecting your lines together will give you shapes.
"Whether they're the basic 2-dimensional ones like squares and circles, the 3-D ones like spheres and boxes, or unique ones that are a result of your creative mind; shapes essentially give your drawings the volume and depth they should have."
"Understanding  shapes  is  important  because  when  combined together,  they  can  form  the  foundations  to  a  more  complex drawing."
A triangle on top of a square can turn into a house.
Ovals stacked together can become pets or wild animals.
A sphere with an irregular box below it can turn into a skull or human head.
"In short, everything you see in life can be drawn easily and properly  when  you  understand  that  they  can  be  visualised  as various shapes put together."
" Whether with your pencil, chalk, drawing inks, wax crayons or any other material you use, shading will further provide depth and volume to whatever you're drawing."
""
But shading anywhere on your canvas or paper isn't the way to achieving a stunning masterpiece.
That's why you should understand how light and shadows play with each other to learn where to put the dark areas on  your  drawing.
Flawlessly darkening some areas on your drawing while leaving white spaces will add a sense of 3- dimensional effect
" and if done properly, you could create an illusion where your drawings tend to pop out of the page as if they're real to those who see them."
Understanding Perspective Combining  your  knowledge  and  experience  on  the  above discussed  basic  elements  of  drawing
you can understand the concept of perspective in terms of drawing.
It essentially gives your drawing a sense of distance as well as provides viewers an idea of the relative space among the structures and characters in your drawing.
"Composition is a great tool to ""say"" something with a drawing, to shape its meaning or message."
Colour  theory  is  both  the  science  and  art  of  using  colour.
"It explains how humans perceive colour; and the visual effects of how  colours  mix,  match  or contrast with each other."
Colour theory also involves the messages colours  communicate;  and  the methods used to replicate colour.
Colour  is  perception.
""
""
Objects in  different reflect combinations  of  wavelengths.
Our  brains  pick  up  on  those  wavelength  combinations  and translate them into the phenomenon we call colour.
Humans see colours in light waves.
""
""
"The more light you add, the brighter the colour mix becomes."
"If you mix all three colours of light, you get pure, white light."
"In colour theory, colours are organized on a colour wheel "
"Colors are grouped into 3 categories: primary colours, secondary colours and tertiary colours."
The colour wheel consists of
"three primary colours - red, yellow, blue"
"three secondary colours - colours created when primary colours are mixed: green, orange, purple"
"six tertiary colours -colours made from primary and secondary colours, such as blue-green or red-violet."
"a line through the center of the wheel, and you'll separate the  warm  colours  from  cool  colours."
" reds, oranges, yellows are warm colours while blues, greens, purples are considered as  cool colours."
"Warm colours are generally associated with energy, brightness, and action, whereas cool colours are often identified with calm, peace, and serenity."
"When  you  recognize  that  colour  has  a  temperature,  you  can understand how choosing all warm or all cool colours can impact your message."
""
" Simply  put,  tints,  tones  and  shades  are  variations  of  hues,  or colours, on the colour wheel."
A tint is a hue to which white has been added.
"For example, red + white = pink."
A shade is a hue to which  black  has  been  added.
""
"For  example,  red  +  black  = burgundy."
""
 a tone is a colour to which black and white (or grey)  have  been  added.
This  darkens  the  original  hue  while making the colour appear more subtle and less intense.

SKY (SPACE)
"Dear student, in the last lesson you learned about fire protectionin Vedas. In this lesson you will learn about the sky i.e. space."
The sky is considered constant.
The quality of the sky is shabd.
Shabd quality is the eternal quality of the sky.
"In the proposed text, we will study many things related to space, such as - aboutthe Sun, Moon and stars, the difference of stars and planets, therelationship between the Sun and the planets, the formation ofday and night, etc."
OBJECTIVES
After reading this lesson you will be able to -
 get to know about space;
"To get to know about Sun, Moon, stars;"
To understand the difference between stars and planets;
To know the relationship between the Sun and the planets;
Understanding of night and day; And
understanding the change of seasons.
SKY (SPACE)
The sky is very large.
It is wrapped around our earth.
When we see it with our eyes we see blue color.
In Vedic culture it is called 'open space' or a place that is void.
It is one of the great five elements.
"If  we  look  at  the  expanse  of  the  sky,  from  theatmosphere around the earth, it is infinite."
"All the weather events like rain, storm etc. occurs in this atmosphere."
"All the planets, satellites, solar system and much Akash(sky) Ganges are foundin space extending beyond the same atmosphere."
Open Space
Our Akash(sky) Ganga is one of these many  Akash (sky) Gangesspread in space.
Our solar system is located in this.
We also know Akash (sky) Ganga as 'Kshir Sagar' and in English it is called'Milky Way' i.e. 'River of Milk'.
OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP
"The sun, moon and stars have a very important role in people'slife."
"In the absence of these, life of humans is not possible."
People of the older generation thought about them in different ways. 
It was believed that our earth remains fixed and the sun moves.
It rises  in  the  morning  and  sets  in  the  evening. 
"Later  it  was discovered that the Earth revolves around the Sun on its axis,while the Sun remains still at one place."
Days and nights are  formed only when the earth revolves around the sun.
"Like the earth, the moon also rotates.The moon revolves around the Earth."
"In this way, nature and human life have been created by the interconnection of the sun,moon, earth and stars."
Civilization and culture have evolved and developed from them.
Let  us  now  try  to  understand  the  solar  system  through  theinteraction of teachers and students.
"When sir entered a class, he had a globe in his hand. He startedobserving it very carefully."
"Sir asked- ""Children, do you know what is in my hand?"""
"""Yes sir, it is a globe."
"We have seen this many times, it is placed on the table of the Principal"", the childrenanswered in one voice."
"""You know, why I brought it to the class today?"" sir asked."
"""You must have brought to teach us  geography  today,""  Radha replied immediately."
"""Exactly, today I will give you information about the solar system i.e. Earth, Sun, Moon and stars, ""sir said."
"""What is this solar system, sir?""Gopal asked.""Now everyone tell! Well, everyone must have seen the sun,moon, earth and stars! ""sir asked."
"""I see many stars on the roof every day before sleeping. I try tocount them as well"", Vivek said."
"""So everyone has seen the sun, moon and stars?"""
"""Yes, sir, see it every day,"" the children said."
"""Together they are called the solar system."
"Today I will teach about it.""Sir raised the globe and showed it to everyone - ""Our earth isround like this and it rotates in this way, tilting on its axis."""
"Saying this, he moved the globe by hand."
"""Sir, what is the relationship between the Earth and the Sun?"" Aristina wanted to know."
"""You know that we all live on Earth."
So far there is no evidence of life on any other planet has been found.
It is believed that the Earth is broken by the sun.
The Sun is a large circle of fire and gases.
"It shines continuously with its light, that's why it is considered a star, ""said sir."
"""Sir, why a star? The sun is the sun, not the star,"" Aristina interrupted."
"""One who shines with its own light is called a star."
The one who receives its light from the star is called the planet. 
"Therefore our earth is the planet,because it receives its light from the sun."
As I said earlier it is round. 
It rotates from east to west on its tilted axis. 
"Along its axis, it also rotates around the Sun."
"It also revolves.This revolution of the Earth is completed in 365 days. . """
"""Does only the Earth revolve around the Sun, sir?"" Gopal asked."
"""No, there are seven more planets besides Earth - Mars,Mercury,Jupiter,Venus,Saturn,Uranus  and  Neptune,which revolve around the sun."
Earlier Pluto was also considered a planet.Now some scholars do not consider him a planet.
All these planets get their  shine  only  from  the  sun.The  bodies that orbit(revolve)around these planets are called satellites.We can call them the Sun's own family.
"These all together are called the Solar System,""sir explained in detail."
"""Well, those who orbit(revolve) the Sun, get light from it, theplanets, and the planets that revolve around satellites, ""Gopal said."
"""Got it all right.""""Do satellites revolve around the Earth as well?"" Arstu asked."
"""Only one satellite orbits (revolve) the Earth."
It is called the moon.
"By the way, many satellites also revolve around other planets."
"Like Mars have 2 satellites, 8 of Neptune, 23 ""Because the moonrevolves  around  the  earth,  that's  why  it  is  also  seen  by  us,sometimes hiding and moving out."
"But sir, why is there a difference in its size? Sometimes it lookslike a plate; sometimes it is incomplete like a laugh."
"But sir, why is there a difference in its size? Sometimes it lookslike a plate; sometimes it is incomplete like a laugh."
"""Yes, it keeps on increasing-decreasing."
"""Yes, it keeps on increasing-decreasing."
"When it starts decreasing it is completely hidden,then there is Amavasya(lunar phase) andwhen it shines completely in the sky,that night is the full moon night."
The journey from Amavasya(lunar phase) to Purnima(full moon) takes fifteen nights.
This movement of the Moon is called the phases of the Moon.
There are two phases of 15-15 nights - Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha.
The  dates  of  the  Indian calendar are based on these.
"""You must have also seen that many stars flicker in the sky."
"There are many stars in them, which are much larger thant he Sun intheir size,""sir said."
"""Then why do they appear so small, sir?"" Vivek asked."
"""Because, they are at a much higher distance from our Earth than the Sun."
You know that a distant object appears small.
"""Then there must be many groups of them sir,"" Vivek asked."
"""Is there a group of seven stars along the pole star (Dhruva tara)."""
Radha questioned.
"""Yes, it is right that the pole star in the north direction remains ina stable position and near those seven stars there is a cluster ofstars, which is named as Sapta Rishi,"" sir told."
"""Sir, sometimes a white milky way of star appears in the sky,what is that?""Arstu asked."
"""It is called Akash Ganga(milky way). Sometimes, the shootingstar also appear in the sky,"" sir explained, then said-"" All ourplanets, satellites, constellations and stars etc. revolve in space,ie the sky."
"Space means the sky, which has no end, thus youknow that all the planets including the earth rotate in the sky, sothey cannot rest on anything."
"• The sun, the earth, the moon, etc. makes up the solar system."
• The sun is a star in the solar system. It shines with its own light.
• Earth receives sunlight in the solar system.That's why earth is called a planet.
• Moon is the satellite of our Earth.It revolves around the earth. 
"• Like the moon, other planets also have satellites, which revolve around them."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 11.1
1. What are the names of the planets in the solar system?
2. What is the difference between stars and planets?
3. Where does the Earth revolve?
4. From whom do satellites receive light?
DAY AND NIGHT OCCURRING
"""Sir you just told us that the Sun is a star, so why doesn't it showup at night? The stars shine  at night don't they?"" Raju asked."
"""You know that, we live on earth."
"The sun rises from the east and sets in the west."" sir said."
"""Wow! Who doesn't know this! I know it too,"" Gopal replied."
"""Then now must have know the truth that the sun does notactually go anywhere, nor does it come from anywhere."
It neither rises nor sinks. It keeps shining in the same place.
"It shines with its spreading light,""sir said while giving information."
"""But we see the sun rising and sinking,"" Gopal said, disagreeing."
"""Well, I have also told you that the earth is round like a globe."
"It also  revolves  around  the  sun  rotating  on  its  tilted  axis,"" sirreminded."
"""What happens with this, sir?"""
"""This is the reason why the sun rises and appears to be sinking."
That is why night and day are made.I have told you that the sunshines steadily at one place. 
The part of the earth that is exposed to the sun is filled with sunlight.
"The light which falls on the part of the earth there the day comes out, ""sir said, placing a part ofthe globe in front of the lighted bulb -"
"""Look, the part of the globe which is In front of this bulb isshining with light, while the shadow of the bulb is seen on theback of the globe."
"Thus, the light does not reach this back part. """"Meaning, the part which is hidden behind, has no light. It isconsidered night there,"" Gopal said."
"""Exactly, the Earth rotates on its axis in 24 hours.This formsnight and day."
"That is, the part of the Earth that faces the Sun, there are days. "
"Likewise, in the rest part, the night occurs. Thus,it is 12 hours a day and 12 hours a night."
Seven days are there in a week.The days of the week are also named according to theseconstellations.
"""Sir; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday arethe names of the planets, but on what basis are the names Sundayand Monday?"""
"""Why, don't you know that the Sun itself is called Ravi, it isnamed after Sunday?"
"The Moon also has a name Som, so a day is named as Monday."""
"""The day and night occur by rotation of the earth and the sun;likewise, the seasons occur by rotation."""
"""How is that sir?"""
"""This revolution of the earth is completed in 365 days."
"7 days in a week, 30 days in a month and 365 days in a year"""
"""But, you were talking about how seasons occur?"" Vivek said,interrupting in the middle."
"""Yes, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is differentduring this orbit (revolution)."
The part of the Earth which is closest to the Sun is affected by the heat which results to summer season.
"The part which is away, winters occur there."
"Due to the rotation of the cycle of seasons is formed. """
"""This way there should be only two seasons.""Gopal expressed doubt."
"""The  temperature  of  the  Earth  changes  due  to  the  increasingdistance between the Sun and the Earth. A mixture of these twoforms the other four seasons. These are called spring, monsoon,autumn and pre-winter,"" sir told."
- The earth rotates on its axis.
"- Because of it, day and night occurs."
- The Earth revolves around the sun is called revolution.
- Seasons are formed due to the mutual distance between the sun and the earth.
"1. When one part of the earth has a day, why is there a night in the other part?"
2. How many seasons are there in our country?
3. How does the earth take to complete one round around the sun?
4. How do days and nights occur?
5. How seasons are formed?
• The sun and along its eight planets build our solar system.
• Those that shine with their own energy are called stars.
• Those who receive light from the stars are called planets.
• The bodies that revolve around the planets are called satellites.
• The Earth revolving around the sun is called revolution.
• The earth takes 24 hours to rotate on its axis.
• Earth completes its revolution around the sun in 365 days.

CONSERVATION OF FIRE(ENERGY) IN VEDAS
"Dear student, in the last lesson you read about fire i.e. energy. Inthis lesson you will read about the importance of conserving fire(energy) in the Vedas. In the Vedas, fire has been considered asthe basic platform for the creation of the environment."
The fire element is present in the form of energy in the whole world.
After reading this lesson you will be able
• To know the importance of Fire (energy) in the Vedas; and
• To understand the basic importance of Fire (energy) in the Vedas.
IMPORTANCE AND CONSERVATION OF FIRE (ENERGY) IN VEDAS
"In Vedic discussion, Fire (energy) has been called Global Fire (Vishvanar)."
Global fire means - the power that keeps the world engaged in work. 
This global fire has been considered as the main factor in the creation of the universe.
""
"In view of the protector of this global fire, sage Madhuchanda says to the Rigveda that"
"That is, one who wishes to keep the fire awake, he has knowledgeabout  the  Samaveda."
Knowledge  and  happiness  are  attained.
Some (likse) consider him as bondage.
"Here the Rigveda sages, point towards the use and protection of Fire (energy)."
Keeping awake means keeping it constant and continuously.
"In our Vedic contemplation, Fire has been considered in three forms -"
(1) Earthly fire
(2) Space fire
(3)  Ordinary (Dyosthani) Fire
The  fire  on  earth  is  called  earthly  fire.  Local  electric  fire  isconsidered as space and solar fire as ordinary fire.
"In this way, this global fire spread everywhere. "
The whole earth is resplendent with this fire.
"While enlightening the importance of fire, the sage of the Rigvedaprays to space fire to protect us from the disturbances of space."
It means that the sun should protect us from celestial disturbances;wind from space disturbances and fire from earth's disturbances.
The sage of the Atharvaveda prays for the protection from demoniacal fire -
I.e. O Sun! You protect me by viewing me.
It has been further said that O Sun illuminate us with his life force -
Punishment has been named in the Vedas to destroy and harm fire(energy).
The Atharvaveda prays that O Fire! Inure and afflict what hurts you -
"Pointing to the importance of solar energy, the kaanv sage of theRigveda says that the Continuous energy is received from the Sun -"
"That is, the rays of the sun continue to spread everywhere with the help of its superlative power."
"The energy of this sun (solar energy) is currently very important,so we need to pay attention to solar energy."
We should use the energy we get from the sun.
Sage  Gritsamad (x`rLen) of the RigVeda states that energy is produced by the rays of the sun which have the power to burn instantly.
"The importance of solar energy was pointed out in Vedic thought, which is getting our focus today."
"Today, efforts are being made to make electricity (electricity) from solar energy."
It is said in the Rigveda that the Sun makes the Som (lkse) strong.The earth also gets stronger with Som (lkse).
"In this context, Som (lkse) means the Moon at some places andSomalata at some places means the gas(Hydrogen, Helium) atsome point in reference to the Sun."
Earlier 'Richa' states that Som (lkse) makes the Sun strong. 
"Here the meaning of Som (lkse) can be derived from hydrogen and helium gas, because Som (lkse)transmits energy from the Sun."

Patanjali Yoga Sutra and Hatha Yoga Pradipika are the yogic texts.
"The yoga sutra’s of Maharshi Patanjali,which is also called ‘Raja Yoga’."
These rules are short and easy to remember.
Hatha Yoga Pradipika of Swathmarama is a Hatha Yoga text.
It starts from physical level Kriyas.
"After studying that lesson, you will be able to: explain the meaning of some sutras of Patanjali Yoga Sutra."
explain slokas of Hath Yoga Prdipika.
write and explain these sutras and slokas.
Now Yoga is explained.
Maharshi  Patanjali  starts  the  yoga  sutra  by  telling  that  now discipline of yoga are being explained and he moves on to next Sutra.
"In this sutra, he says that yoga is to stop the chattering of the mind, after controling mind will attain peacefulness"
There are five classes of modification.
1) Knowing correctly (Pramana) 2) Incorrect knowing (Viparyaya) 3) Imagination (Vikalpa) 4) Deep sleep (Nidra) 5) Memory (Smriti)
"In this sutra, he has explained the causes for the pain."
"The causes for  pain  are Avidya  (Ignorance), Asmitha  (I-feeling),  Raga (Liking), Dvesha (Disliking) and Abhinivesha (Fear)."

"Salutation to Adinatha (Shiva) who explained the knowledge of Hatha Yoga, which like a staircase leads the aspirant to the highest Raja Yoga."
"Yogin Swatmarama, after saluting first his Guru Srinatha explains Hatha Yoga for the attainment of Raja Yoga."
The highest state of RajaYoga is unknown due to misconceptions (darkness) created by varying ideas and concepts.
"In good will and as a blessing, Swatmarama offers light on HathaYoga."
Yogi Matsyendranath knew the knowledge of HathaYoga.
He gave it to Gorakhnath and others.
by their grace the author (Swatmarama) learned it.
HathaYoga is the greatest secret of the yogis who wish to attain perfection (Siddhi).
"Indeed, to be fruitful, it must be kept secret; "
revealed it becomes powerless.
"The Hatha Yogi should live alone in a hermitage,"
"and practice in a place of the size of the length of a bow (one and a half meters),"
"there is no hazard from rocks, fire or water,"
It is in a well-administered and virtuous kingdom (nation or town) where good alms can be easily attained.
This is the description of the yoga hermitage as prescribed by the Hatha Yoga practitioners.
"Describing in detail, The room of sadhana shouldn't have window, holes or cracks."
"It should be spotlessly clean, wiped with cow manure"
It should be free from animals or insects.
"Outside, there should be an open platform with a thatched roof, "
and a surrounding wall (fence).

"In the previous lesson, you have learned about some selected slokas and sutras from Yoga Sutra and Hath Yoga Pradipika."
Patanjali Yoga is the system which consists of eight stages.
"These are Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi."
It is therefore widely called Ashtanga yoga (the yoga of eight stages).
In this lesson you will learn Yama which is social discipline and Niyama which is personal discipline.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to: explain Yama and Niyama."
"differentiate between the first three Yama-Ahimsa, Satya and Asteya."
"and explain the first three Niyama of Shoucha, Santhosha and Tapas."
Yama is the first step of Ashtanga Yoga.
Yama means social code.
"There are five Yama; Ahimsa, Sathya, Asteya, Brahmacharya and Aparigraha."
"Among these five Yama, you will learn the first three yama i.e. Ahimsa, Sathya and Asteya."
"Ahimsa means following nonviolence in action, speech and even in the mind."
Completely following nonviolence is the first Yama.
Let’s read a beautiful story of Buddha and Angulimala.
This story explains the meaning of Ahimsa and its implications in our life.
"This story begins at the University of Taxshila, which was a great university in ancient India."
Ahimsaka was a brilliant student.
He excelled in all his subjects.
"Because of this, the other students became jealous."
They made up stories to make the teacher believe 
Students told that Ahimsaka was evil.
The teacher believed these lies and decided to get rid of Ahimsaka.
The teacher knew that Ahimsaka never disrespected elders.
He always listened to his elders.
"so the teacher decided to give Ahimsaka an impossible task,"
"The teacher him that in order to graduate, he needed to collect one thousand little fingers."
"This is an impossible task, therefore Ahimsaka will never come back."
"Instead of giving up, Ahimsaka set out to collect one thousand little fingers."
"However, he soon discovered that nobody would easily give up their little fingers."
So he hid in the forest 
and murdered people to get their fingers.
He found that he had nowhere to store these fingers.
"So he put them on a string around his neck, to keep he count."
"Because of this terrific necklace of fingers, was nicknamed Angulimala, meaning ‘finger garland’."
Angulimala means ‘finger garland’.
"One day, Buddha left his monastery for a walk in the forest."
"Although Angulimala lived there, Buddha was not afraid, went there"
he continued on his way.
"On this particular day, Angulimala only had one more finger to collect, "
"so when he saw Buddha entering the forest, he dashed out to murder him "
"But no matter how fast he ran behind Buddha, he never seemed to be able to catch up with him."
We can see from this example that Buddha who was follower of nonviolence 
He transformed Angulimala into a monk who was a murderer.
Nonviolence is the personal practice of being harmless to self and also others in any condition.
So practice nonviolence.
"Satya is the second of the Yamas, following Ahimsa."
Satya means always following the truthfulness.
Let’s learn the meaning of Satya through a beautiful story of Kabir and a thief.
Kabir was a poet - saint.
One day he was humming a Doha (a couplet) as he sat weaving a cloth.
"Suddenly, the front door of his hut was thrown open and there stood a ruffian, "
"He told “Quick, show me a place to hide"""
the policeman is after me!
"Kabir calmly pointed to bales of cotton huddled together and said, “There! There you will be safe!” The introduder hid there."
Now the police man entered the hut and asked about the thief
"Kabir, in his unique style, casually pointed to the bales of cotton."
The policeman looked at Kabir’s face and  he did not take him seriously and left from there.
We can see from this example that Kabir who was follower of truthfulness transformed a thief into his disciple.
If you are not truthful to yourself it will harm you.
Asteya means non-stealing.
The Story of woodcutter which shows that how a woodcutter’s non-stealing attitude makes him rich.
This story gives you a clear understanding of non-stealing.
Kalidas was a humble woodcutter.
He was living in a village named Udayapur.
The village was near by a dense forest.
All the villagers were depending upon the forest for their livelyhood.
Kalidas was going regularly to collect firewood.
He was selling the wood in the near-by market.
With that little earning he was managing his family.
"Like usual routine, one day he had gone to the forest to collect the firewood."
He was cutting a tree near the river and His axe slipped away from his hand and was lost in the river.
That poor person got afflicted 
He had only one axe.
Thinking about the future he started weeping.
"Listening to his crying, the river goddess came in front of him"
She asked the reason for his crying.
Kalidas explained everything in detail to the river goddess.
After listening to everything the water goddess plunged into the river.
After a while she came out from the water with a golden axe.
She showed the golden axe to Kalidas and asked “Is it yours?” 
" Kalidas examined the golden axe and said “No my lord, it’s not mine.”"
"Keeping the axe aside, the river goddess plunged into the river a second time. This time she came with a silver axe."
She showed the silver axe to Kalidas and asked again “Is it yours?”  Kalidas said 
"“It is not mine. I am a poor woodcutter. How can I own a golden or silver axe!"""
 I have only an iron axe.
Listening to this the river goddess plunged once again inside the river. This time she came back with the iron axe of Kalidas.
"Seeing his axe, he showed his gratefulness and respect to the river goddess."
Seeing the honesty of Kalidas the river goddess got pleased
She gave the golden and silver axe as a gift to him with his original iron axe.
We can see from this example that the attitude of non-stealing is a boon from God.
So it is good to practice Asteya.
Who was trying to hide in Kabir’s hut?
Who was following thief?
Who was Kalidas?
Why Kalidas refused to accept golden axe?
Why angulimala was following Bhagwan Buddha?
Niyama is the second step of Ashtanga Yoga.
Niyama means personal code.
"There are five Niyama, they are Shoucha, Santhosha, Tapas, Swadhyaya and Ishwarapranidhana."
Among this five Niyama you will learn the first three which will help give you a clear understanding Niyama.
"The first of the five Niyamas is shoucha, which means cleanliness or purity."
Shoucha removes negative thoughts and makes us healthy.
"Right from small things like brushing teeth etc., fixed rules and regulations have been placed, such that utmost cleanliness prevails in the society."
Shoucham is of two kinds- 
"external cleanliness that includes the cleanliness of the body, objects and the surroundings"
the internal cleanliness that involves the purification of the mind.
Most people keep their house clean and neat.
But this attitude is not extended to the external surroundings.
Many people don't use the dustbins.
Cleanliness is not limited to keeping the house and surroundings clean.
"Human beings have made the air, water and earth dirty and polluted by their actions."
Therefore should throw garbage only into the dustbins.
"We should avoid those actions that may cause, water, noise or air pollutions etc."
"Shoucham is also internal cleansing where we abstain from jealousy, hatred, anger, greed, arrogance and develop the attitude of love, compassion, friendliness, cheerfulness etc."
Santhosha is the second of the Niyamas.
Santhosha means contentment.
The following Story of a happy man conveys a beautiful picture of Santhosha.
He was well-disposed to everyone he met.
"He always smiled, and had kind and encouraging words to say, whenever it was necessary."
"Everyone who met him, left feeling better, happier and elated."
"People knew they could count on him, and regarded him as a great friend."
"One of the village dwellers was curious to know what his secret was, and how he could always be so kind and helpful."
"He wondered, how is it that he held no grudge toward anyone, and was always happy."
Once he met him in the street.
" he asked him: ""Most people are selfish and unsatisfied."
They do not smile as often as you do; neither are they as helpful or kind as you are.
What is the secret behind it?
"The man smiled at him and replied, ""When you make peace with yourself, you can be in peace with the rest of the world."
"If you can recognize the spirit in yourself, you can recognize the spirit in everyone, "
and then you find it natural to be kind and well disposed to all.
"If your thoughts are under your control, you become strong and firm."
The personality is like a robot programmed to do certain tasks.
Your habits and thoughts are the tools and programs that control your personality.
"If you don't give attention, you will become free from being programmed"
the inner good and the happiness that reside within you will be revealed.
By this only good habits will get developed.
"But for this, it is important to work very hard."
The personality should be well developed. 
The ability to concentrate and to control the thoughts has to be strengthened.
The work is difficult and endless.
There are many walls that need to be to climbed. It is not an easy task. lamented the villager.
"He replied - Do not think about the difficulties, otherwise this is what you will see and experience."
"Just quieten your feelings and thoughts, and try to stay in this peace."
"Just try to be calm with people, and do not let yourself be carried away by your thoughts."
"""Is that all?"" asked the villager."
That person told to practice to watch the thoughts.
Try to watch your thoughts and see how they come and go.
Stay in the quietness that arises.
"The moments of peace will be brief at first, but in time they will get longer."
"The peace is also strength, power, kindness, and love.In time, you will realize that you are one with the universal power."
"Small thoughts such as selfish, small, limited ego, etc won't even touch you."
"""I will try to remember your words,"" said the villager,"
"""there is another thing that I am curious about."""
You do not seem to be influenced by the environment.
"You have a kind word for everyone, and you are helpful."
People treat you well.
Being good and being kind do not necessarily point to weakness.
"When you are good, you can also be strong."
"""Thank you very much for your advice and explanations"", said the villager, and said ""You explanation gave me the clarity"""
Now I became happy.
"We can see from the above story that, village man who understood the secret of happiness was not only happy but people around him were also happy."
"Long ago, there lived a great scholar and astrologer by the name Pani, on the banks of the river Indus."
"By the grace of Lord Shiva, Pani's wife delivered a healthy son."
The son came to be known as Panini.
The little boy was very active and his smile reminded one of the full moon..
"One day, a friend, scholar, and palmist visited Pani."
He was served the best food and was treated with the best services.
"After lunch, the great man called the child Panini and asked him to sit with him."
Panini readily agreed and sat happily with the great man.
He looked at the right palm of the child.
Because he has no education line on his palm
Pani asked - but would it be possible that you haven't checked my son's palm correctly?
I have checked the boy's palm thoroughly
What are Yama and Niyama?
Which are the three Yama’s explained in this lesson?
Which are the three Niyama’s explained in this lesson?
Why Panini made a cut on his hand?
Why river goddess returned all axes to the wood cutter?

Such teaching learning methods help promote attention-focusing quality.
Games help the learner to focus attention more effectively than any other teaching tools.
This method is also used as a way to teach and learn in the early years.
The learning through play helps in the mastery of social skills of becoming a team player.
This is basically a game for teaching to be focussed.
The players will stand with their hands on the waist in a straight line or in a circle.
The organiser/teacher will arrange chairs in a line.
The number of chairs lined up will be 1-2 less than the number of children participating in the game.
The teacher will either blow a whistle continuously or arrange for some music to be played.
"When the teacher stops playing the musical instrument, all the players must run to sit on the chairs lined up."
The player who does not manage to sit on the chair will be out.
The teacher then keeps removing a few chairs after each round till finally the winner is found.
This is basically a game of alertness and being focussed.
"Each participant will try to keep his right hand on another's head as the Bhasmasura did and say ""Bhasma"", (Ash)."
At the same time the playere should stop others from keeping their hands on his head.
For this they use their left hand.
They can protect their head by keeping their left hand just above their head but not touching it.
One whose head is touched by another's hand is deemed out.
The game continues till the winner is found.
This is basically an awareness and number game.
The children sit in a circle and the teacher calls out some numbers.
"Whenever 3 and its multiples are called, the players will say ‘HARI’and wherever 5 and its multiples are called the players will say‘OM’."
"Wherever multiples of 3 and 5 are called together, the players will say “hari –om”."
The player who repeats the actual number called out instead of ‘Hari’ ‘om’ will be out.
All the players stand in straight line as shown in the figure.

Kerchief was dropped so carefully that 'Y' is not aware of it.
"If 'Y' is not yet aware of the kerchief, then 'X' after completing his round comes and punches on Y's back till'Y' picks up the kerchief"
now 'X' will occupy Y's place.
"If 'Y' comes to know about the placing of the kerchief before hand, "
he picks up the kerchief and chases 'X'

Like this 'X' has to drop the kerchief at the back of some other player.
"If 'Y' does not succeed in touching'X’, then 'X' will occupy Y's place"
and 'Y’ will run and game continues as above.
A player will be selected and he/she has to assume the posture of a frog and start chasing the other players.

Yoga is a mastery over the mind.There are various streams of Yoga.
 Swami Vivekananda broadly categorized this into four streams as they are:
Karma Yoga  -    this  is  about  selfless  action  without  an attachment to the results.
Raja Yoga - this is the practical approach to reach higher states of consciousness.
Bhakti Yoga - this is an attitude of total surrender and love.
Jnana Yoga - this is the path of knowledge. It deals with the intellect.
"Swami Vivekananda said, “All streams of Yoga lead to the same goal.  "
"Do  it  by  work  (Karma Yoga),  worship  (Bhakti Yoga), philosophy (Jyana Yoga) or psychic control (Raja Yoga) by any one or two or all of these and be free”."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able"
"recall four streams of Yoga- Karma Yoga, Raja Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Jnana Yoga and"
"practice  Karma Yoga,  Raja Yoga,  Bhakti Yoga  and  Jnana Yoga."
Karma means any action which is physical or mental.
"Karma yoga is welfare activity, performed selflessly, unattached and silently. "
"Karma yoga is also an art of ‘working in relaxation’ with total ‘ Awareness ’. Our actions are classified into three, namely Tamas, Rajas and Sattva."
Tamas-This is the darkness and the crudeness in man. 
It is born  of  ignorance  and  the  cause  of  delusion. 
" It  binds  us through recklessness, laziness and sleep."
Rajas -This is full of passion and is born out intense desire and attachment.
 It binds the usthrough attachment with action.
"Sattva -This is pure, without impurities, illuminating and free from sickness. "
It binds usthrough attachment with happiness and knowledge.
Karma Yoga offers us three methods towards achieving the goal.
"First step: This is to destroy the Tamas and remove the resistance to action, both physical and mental."
"Second step:This is to overcome the problems of Rajas, manage the most difficult situations as fire-fighting with ease and not get lost."
Third step:This is to resolve all conflicts that arise on our way towards achieving the goal.
Let us now learn and understand one of the famous sloka from Bhagavad Gita which explains the Karma yoga:
"You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions."
" Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction. BG 2.47"
"This is a very popular verse of the Bhagavad Gita, so much so that even most school children in India are familiar with it."
 It offers deep insight into the proper spirit of work and is often quoted whenever the topic of Karma yoga is discussed.
 This verse gives four instructions regarding the Karma yoga
"Do your duty, but do not worry yourself with the results."
The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment.
"Even while working, give up the pride of doership."
Do your work in regulated and disciplined manner.
Raja means King. Raja yoga is the path of discipline and practice with will power.
  The main texts of this tradition are yoga sutra of Maharshi Patanjali. It is also known as Ashtanga Yoga (The eight-step yoga) because it is organized into eight parts:
Yama – Self control
Niyama - Discipline
Asana - Physical exercises
Pranayama  -  Breathing exercises
Pratyahara - Removal of the senses from external objects
Dharana - Concentration
Dhyana - Meditation
Samadhi - Complete realization
Raja yoga is also defined as the path of willpower.
 Lord Krishna explains this aspect  in Bhagavad Githa:
"Elevate  yourself  through  the  power  of  your  mind,  and  not degrade yourself, for the mind can be the friend and also the enemy of the self. BG 6.5"
Lord Krishna says that we must use the mind to elevate the self.
"In other words, we must use the intellect to control the mind. "
"In today’s time if we are suffering from various problems, suffering from  ill  health,  tensions  and  stresses,  these  are  of  our  own making. "
"Therefore, it is for us to change ourselves to overcome these miseries and grow to reach higher states of bliss, creativity and freedom."
Swami Vivekananda says that “We are the makers of our own destiny”.
 We have been given the freedom to choose either to make or damage ourselves.
" If we use this freedom of will, the power of intelligence and discrimination for development, we ‘make’ ourselves. And if we misuse, there is decline and we ‘damage’ ourselves."
"We  all  possess  that  “will”  power  as  a  manifestation  of  that freedom is in ourselves. Thus, Raja Yoga is to use that will power and elevate ourselves."
1. Karma means any action which is…………. or…………. .
"2. Our actions are classified into……… , ……… and……. ."
3. Raja Yoga is also known as…………….
"The term Bhakti comes from the root 'Bhaj', which means 'to be attached to God'."
 Bhakti yoga is a devotion and it is focused on the cultivation of love and devotion towards the God. 
" The origin of  Bhakti  can  be  seen  in  the  Upanishads,  specifically  the Shvetashvatara Upanishad. "
" The Bhagavad Gita, The Puranas and Narada Bhakti Sutra are important scriptures that explain the philosophy of Bhakti yoga."
Lord Krishna explains the quality of Bhakta in Bhagavad Gith that:
"Those  devotees  are  very  dear  to  me  who  are  free  from  hatred toward all living beings, who are friendly, and compassionate. They are free from attachment to possessions and egotism, equipoised in happiness and distress, and ever-forgiving. BG 12.13"
"Bhakti softens the heart and removes jealousy, hatred, lust, anger, egoism, pride and arrogance."
"Bhakti infuses joy, divine ecstasy, bliss, peace and knowledge."
"All  cares,  worries  and  anxieties,  fears,  mental  torments  and tribulations entirely vanish."
Bhavas or feelings are natural to human beings and so these are easy to practice.
 There are five kinds of bhava in Bhakti.
Shanta  Bhava:  The  devotee  is shanta  or  peaceful. 
 He  does  no jump  and  dance. 
 Bhishma  was  a Shanta Bhakta.
"DasyaBhava:  It  is  about  being  a servant of god. Lord Hanuman was a  Dasya  Bhakta.  He  had  Dasya Bhava, servant attitude."
"SakhyaBhava:  God  is  a  friend  of the devotee. Arjuna had this Bhava towards Lord Krishna. They both used to sit, eat, talk and walk together as close friends."
"Vatsalya Bhava: The devotee looks upon God as his child. Yashoda  had  this  Bhava  with  Lord  Krishna.  The  devotee serves, feeds, and looks upon God as a mother does in the case of her child."
Madhurya Bhava: This is the highest form of Bhakti. The devotee respects the Lord as his lover. This was the relation between Radha and Krishna. The devotee and God feel one with each other and still maintain a separateness in order to enjoy the bliss of the play of love between them.
"Navavidha Bhakti: The nine forms of devotion are Shravanam – Hearing the names, stories and glories of the God Keertanam – Chanting his glories Smaranam – Remembering the God"
• Paada sevanam – Serving the God’s feet
• Archanam – Worshiping the God
• Vandanam – Offering obeisance unto the God
• Daasyam – Serving the God as his servant
• Sakhyam – Developing friendship with the God
• Aatma Nivedanam – Total surrender of oneself to the God
Bhakti is bliss and more blissful would be our lives when we cultivate and practice the above discussed Navavidha Bhakti or nine  forms  of  devotion  in  our  journey  of  life  towards  theSupreme.
Jnana means knowledge or wisdom. Jnana yoga is the path of intellect and the path of analysis. This is also the yoga of wisdom and has its own methodology.
The fundamental goal of Jnana yoga is to become liberated from ignorance and to achieve the true knowledge or wisdom.
Lord Krishna say’s in Bhagavad Gith that:
Even those who are considered the most immoral of all sinners can cross over this ocean of material existence by seating themselves in the boat of divine knowledge.BG 4.36
The three methodology of Jnana Yoga are:
Shravana: It means hearing. Hearing a lecture or reading a book or watching a video all come under Shravana.
"Manana: After  hearing  a lecture,  you  must  start cognizing  about  it,  then logically try to understand it,  repeat  that  again  and again, questioning it to themaximum possible extent which is  called Manana."
Nididhyasana: It means experiment.
Experiencing true knowledge through Jnana yoga allows the student to know God and  be liberated.
"In this unit you have understood the four paths of yoga, namely Karma Yoga, Raja Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Jnana Yoga. "
You also learned the methods and steps of these Yoga.

IMPORTANT TEXTS OF HATHA YOGA
"Hatha Yoga starts from the Annamaya Kosha (physical level), which helps to create a balance between the mind and body."
"Although Hatha yoga begins with the Annamaya Kosha, if performed correctly, the practices of Hatha yoga impact the subtler Pranamaya (Vital force), Manomaya (Mental) and Vijnanamaya (Intellectual) Koshas  as well."
" As one practices Hatha yoga techniques, one's physical and mental potential begin to increase and unfold. "
 Many yogis have written the Hatha yoga texts.
Hatha yoga practices start from following:
Proper Diet- The Hatha yoga texts emphasize on moderate eating or consuming a measured diet. 
Hatha yoga pradipika suggests that One's eating habits should not be driven by cravings.
"A proper diet is one which is tasty, likable and nutritious."
The diet should be able to fulfill all the required nutritional needs of the body entirely.
It also suggests that one should eat only when hungry and not otherwise.
Proper Body Cleansing- Hatha yoga suggests a list of cleansing techniques known as shat-karma
Dhauti- Cleanse teeth and body
Neti- Cleanse nasal passages
Basti-Cleanse bladder
Trataka- Cleanse eyes
Kapalabhati-Cleanse phlegm
Nauli-Abdominal massage 
Proper Postures- Asanas are specialized postures of the body often imitating many of the animal postures. 
Large number of Asanas exists.
"The main four Asanas are: Padmasana, Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Vajrasana"
Proper Breathing- Pranayama is a breathing technique.
This practice will consciously regulate our breath combined with focused muscles exercises. 
There are several ways in which one can regulate the breathing.
" The following are the few examples of Pranayama: Nadishuddhe, Bhramari, Shitali, Ujjayi Mudra's and Vital Energies- Mudra's or hand gestures are important while performing meditation as these are vital to reach out as well as manipulate the dormant vital energies in the body."

I. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RAJA YOGA AND HATHA YOGA
Hatha Yoga is the physical practice of yoga which focuses first on the Kriya and Asana practice. 
Hatha yoga is part of the integral system of Raja Yoga and focuses on the subtle energy flow in the body known as Prana.
Hatha Yoga is the ladder leading to Raja Yoga. 
We can find the reference of this in Hatha Yoga Pradipika.
"Prostrating first to the guru, Yogi Swatmarama instructs the knowledge of Hatha yoga only for the Raja Yoga (the highest state of yoga)."
Raja yoga is the royal path of yoga consisting of eight steps.
" The first steps, Yama and Niyama, are the moral foundations for the yoga practice followed by Asana, Pranayama, sense withdrawal, concentration, and culminating with meditation and Samadhi."
 Raja yoga is about controlling the mind and thought waves in the mind.

………………is a breathing technique.
WHAT ARE BANDHAS AND MUDRAS?
"Bandha Bandha means to lock, close-off, to stop."
" In the practice of a Bandha, the energy flow to a particular area of the body is blocked. "
"When the Bandha is released, this causes the energy to flood more strongly through the body with an increased pressure."
There are four types of Bandhas:
Mula Bandha - Anal Lock
Uddiyana Bandha - Lifting of the Diaphragm
Jalandhara Bandha - Chin Lock
Maha Bandha - Practice of all three Bandhas at the same time.
Mudra means a 'sign' or a 'seal' in sanskrit.
" The word mudra has a number of different meanings in yoga which include meditation practices. Here, 'Mud' means 'to delight' or 'to be happy' and 'Ra' means 'to give'. "
An action that gives us delight or extreme joy.
Mudra's are most commonly associated with various hand gestures.
"The fingers are related to different types of energies and when they are brought together in specific ways, they produce subtle effects."
The Basics of Mudra's
Thumb-The fire (Agni)
Index finger-The air (Vayu)
Middle finger-The ether (Aakasha)
Ring finger-The earth (Prithvi)
"Small finger-The water (Jala) so as to bring back the balance in the five elements, there are some specific methods of touching and aligning the fingers with each other."
"The following are the few examples of Mudra: Chin Mudra, Chinmaya Mudra, Adi Mudra, Bramha Mudra"

We all get angry - and children are no different.
What techniques should we recommend for children to express their anger in an acceptable manner.
Anger is a strong feeling of displeasure which leads to frustration and confusion.
There are three approaches to deal with anger. Suppression: Suppression is where a person either is not aware of the anger or doesn't feel safe in expressing. This can lead to deeper long-term ailments
"Calming: Calming is a way to get ready for thinking through a  situation  and  figuring  out  how  to  express  the  anger,  for example taking slow, deep breaths and counting 10 backward."
iii. Expression:  Expression  is  the  healthiest  way  to  deal  with anger to express it appropriately.
"Children must be taught an appropriate expression of anger which means, there should be healthy emotional expression."
"As long as children are interacting with the world, they will get angry."
We cannot control them and expect them to always be at peace with everyone and everything.
"Research has shown that physical outlet helps them with their feelings, although sometimes turning to a creative outlet is perfect for him as well."
"Hence in Yoga we have some physical exercises, Asanas, Suryanamaskara, Pranayama, Sukshma Vyayama and simple Meditation techniques which helps them to calm down their mind with express appropriate expression of anger"
In this lesson you will be learning the practices which help in anger management.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to:"
• explain different types of yogic practices;

"The simple, gentle joint movements are very useful to improve blood supply towards the parts of joints like cartilage, ligaments etc."
Especially those joint movements are very much significant if performed early morning.
It also helps to drain some toxic materials  in  the  interstitial  spaces  related  to  joint.
"The  most important and beautiful facet of Yogic Sukshma Vyayama is that every body part such as every muscle, joint and organ is taken into consideration."
The main features or components of Sukshma Vyayamaa are

.  VIBHUTI  PADA
Dharana is holding the mind on to some particular object.
An unbroken flow of knowledge to that object is Dhyana.
"When that, giving up all forms, reflects only themeaning, it is Samadhi."
(These)  three  (when  practised)  in  regard  to  one  object  is Samyama.
By the conquest of that comes light of knowledge.
That should be employed in stages.
These three are nearer than those that precede.
But even they are external to the seedless (Samadhi).
"By the suppression of the disturbed modifications of the mind, and by the rise of modifications of control,the mind is said to attain  the  controllingmodifications  -  followinghe  controlling powers ofthe mind."
Its flow becomes steady by habit.
"Taking in all sorts of objects and concentrating uponone object, these two powers being destroyed andmanifested respectively, the Chitta gets the modificationcalled Samadhi."
"The one-pointedness of the Chitta is when it grasps in one, the past and present."
"By this is explained the threefold transformations ofform, time and state, in fine or gross matter, and in theorgans."
"That which is acted upon by transformations, eitherpast, present or yet to be manifested, is the qualified."
The succession of changes is the cause of manifold evolution.
By making Samyama on the three sorts of changescomes the knowledge of past and future.
"By making Samyama on word, meaning, andknowledge, which are  ordinarily  confused,  comes  theknowledge  of  all  animal sounds."
"By perceiving the impressions, knowledge of pastlife."
By making Samyama on the signs in another's bothknowledge of that mind comes.
"But not its contents, that not being the object of theSamyama."
"By  making  Samyama  on  the  form  of  the  body  thepower  of perceiving forms being obstructed, thepower of manifestation in the eye being separated, theYogi's body becomes unseen."
By this the disappearance or concealment of wordswhich are being spoken is also explained.
"By making Samyama on friendship, etc., variousstrength comes."
"By making Samyama on that effulgent light comesthe knowledge of the fine, the obstructed, and theremote."
"By making Samyama on the sun, (comes) the knowledge of the world."
"On the moon, (comes) the knowledge of the cluster ofstars."
On the pole star (comes) the knowledge of themotions of the stars.
On the navel circle (comes) the knowledge of theconstitution of the body.
On the hollow of the throat (comes) cessation ofhunger.
On the nerve called Kurma (comes) fixity of thebody.
On  the  light  emanating  from  the  top  of  the  head  sightof  the Siddhas.
Or by the power of Pratibha all knowledge.
"In the heart, knowledge of minds."
Enjoyment comes by the non-discrimination of thevery distant soul and Sattva.
"From  that  arises  the  knowledge  of  hearing,  touching,seeing, tasting, and smelling, belonging to Pratibha."
These are obstacles to Samadhi; but they are powers in the worldly state.
"When the cause of bondage has become loosened, theYogi, by his  knowledge  of  manifestation  through  theorgans,  enters another's body."
"By conquering the current called Udana the Yogidoes not sink in water, or in swamps, and he can walkon thorns."
By the conquest of the current Samana he issurrounded by blaze.
By making Samyama on the relation between the ear and the Akasa comes divine hearing.
By making Samyama on the relation between theAkasa and the body the Yogi becoming light as cottonwool goes through the skies.
"By making Samyama on the real modifications of themind, which are outside, called great disembodiness,comes disappearance of the covering to light."
"By making Samyama on the elements, beginning withthe gross, and ending with the superfine, comesmastery of the elements."
"From  that  comes  minuteness,  and  the  rest  of  the  powers, ""glorification of the body,"" andindestructibleness of the bodily qualities."
"The glorifications of the body are beauty, complexion, strength, adamantine hardness."
"By making Samyama on the objectivity, knowledge and egoism of the organs, by gradation comes theconquest of the organs."
"From that comes glorified mind, power of the organsindependently of the body, and conquest of nature."
"By making Samyama on the Sattva, to him who hasdiscriminated between the intellect and the Purusacomes omnipresence and omniscience."
By giving up even these comes the destruction of the very seed of evil; he attains Kaivalya.
"The Yogi should not feel allured or flattered by theovertures of celestial beings, for fear of evil again."
By making Samyama on a particle of time and its multiples comes discrimination.
"Those which cannot be differentiated by species, signand place, even they will be discriminated by theabove Samyama."
"The saving knowledge is that knowledge ofdiscrimination which covers all objects, all means."
By  the  similarity  of  purity  between  the  Sattva  and  thePurusa comes Kaivalya.
"Maharshi Patanj\ali was a great sage who had compiled all the 195  Yoga Sutras at Rudraprayag,  a  hilly  district  in Uttrakhand,   1700 years ago."
It is believed that Maharishi Patanjali was the avatar or incarnation of AdiShesha (The Serpent upon whom Lord Vishnu rests).

"The Siddhis (powers) are attained by birth, chemicalmeans, power of words, mortification or concentration."
"The change into another species is by the filling in of nature. Good deeds, etc., are not the direct causes in thetransformation of nature, but they act as breakers ofobstacles to the evolutions of nature, as a farmer breaks the obstacles to the course of water, whichthen runs down by its own nature."
"Though the activities of the different created minds are various, the one original mind is the controller ofthem all."
"Works are neither black nor white for the Yogis; forothers they are threefold, black, white, and mixed."
From these threefold works are manifested in eachstate only those desires fitting to that statealone.
"(The others are held in abeyance for the timebeing.) There  is  connectiveness  in  desire,  even  thoughseparated  by speices, space and time, there beingidentifi-cation of memory and impressions."
"Thirst for happiness being eternal, desires are withoutbeginning. Being held together by cause, effect, support, andobjects, in the absence of these is its absence."
"The past and future exist in their own nature, qualitieshaving different ways. They are manifested or fine, being of the nature of theGunas."
"The  object  ofperception  is  not  dependent  on  the  chitta;  what would happen to the object of perception when the medium of cognition is not there? Things are known or unknown to the mind, beingde-pendent on the colouring which they give to themind."
"The states of the mind are always known because thelord of the mind is unchangeable. Mind is not self-luminous, being an object."
From its being unable to cognise two things at the same time. Another cognising mind being assumed there will beno end to such assumptions and confusion ofmemory.
"The  essence  of  knowledge  (the  Purusa)  beingun-changeable, when the mind takes its form, itbecomes conscious."
For the discriminating the perception of the mind asAtman ceases. Then bent on discriminating the mind attains theprevious state of Kaivalya (isolation).
"The resolution in the inverse order of the qualities,berfect of any motive  of  action  for  the  Purusa,  isKaivalya,  or  it  is  the establishment of the power ofknowledge in its own nature."

"If you don't have chairs, you can use carpet squares, or pillows instead."
"As  soon  as  the  music  starts  playing,  the  players  walk  in a  circle  around  the  chairs."
"You  can  choose  whether to  go  clockwise  or  counter-clock-wise,  but  all  players should go the same direction following the person in front of them."
"After some time, the teacher, or host should stop the music."
"When the music stops, each player needs to find a chair to sit down in."
There will be one player left without a chair to sit in because there is one less chair than players.
The  player  that  didn't  find  a  chair  to  sit  it  is  out  of  the game.
"After the person who didn't find a chair leaves the game, you need to remove one chair to play another round."

V. BHASMASURAH The story of Bhasmasurah:
Bhasmasura was a very powerful asura (demon).
"He was very big and strong but at the same time, he was also very foolish."
"Bhasmasura prayed to Shiva. Pleased with his devotion, Shiva decided to grant him a boon."
"When Shiva asked, Bhasmasura said,  ""Lord, please grant me the wish that whichever person, place or thing I place my right hand on, is reduced to ashes."
" Lord  Shiva  granted  him  the  boon  and  Bhasmasura  was  very happy.  Having got the boon, the wicked Bhasmsura tried the boon on Shiva himself. As  a  result,  Shiva  started  running from  Bhasmasura  to  save  himself. Seeing  Shiva's  plight,  Lord  Vishnu decided  to  help  him.  He  changed himself  into  a  beautiful  young maiden,  called  Mohini,  instead. He was attacked by Mohini's beauty and asked  her  to  marry  him. Mohini agreed to marry him, but she had a condition. She asked Bhasmasura to touch his head and promise her that he  would  not  marry  again  if  she became  his  wife.  Bhasmasura  agreed. As  soon  as  the  foolish demon touched his head, he was reduced to ashes. That is how Vishnu succeeded in saving Shiva from Bhasmasura.     Each participant will try to keep his right hand on another's head as the Bhasmasura did and say Bhasma"", (Ash)."

The entire world is made up of three aspects;
" Sattva, Rajas and Tamas."
These in their original form are invisible.
They are not seen by your eyes. You cannot touch them.
one  cannot taste Guna like salt.
you've seen  different t.v channels   making documentaries of different things the vast universe.
The spend lot of time lot of energy to follow animals birds plants insects at cetera.  Sometimes it takes more than a decade to document the life journey of of small insect. 
 Day and night without blinking their eyes with very sophisticated cameras the scientist wait to observe a creature.
This kind of passion is needed to know even three Gunas.
"Alike human beings, plants also have lives."
"As you know the life in the plants is inferred through different activities such as growth, movement, reproduction and breathing, similarly you have to infer these Gunas through continuous self-observation."
To know the vastness and all pervasive nature of Trigunas you should grow in life.
"But, even now you can see and observe about which of three gunas is predominant in you"
"Geeta is one such book which tells about three gunas in detail it says about how three Trigunas have influence on our thinking, sleeping, eating, behaving etc."
In fact there is nothing in the world which is not influenced by Gunas because everything is made up of Gunas only.

"My womb is the great Brahma; in that I place the germ; thence, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings!"
"Whatever forms are produced, O Arjuna, in any womb whatsoever, the great Brahma is their womb and I am the seed-giving father."
"Of these, Sattwa, which from its stainlessness is luminous and healthy, binds by attachment to knowledge and to happiness, O sinless one!"
"Know thou Rajas to be of the nature of passion, the source of thirst (for sensual enjoyment) and attachment; it binds fast, O Arjuna, the embodied one by attachment to action!"
"But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all  embodied  beings;  it  binds  fast,  O  Arjuna,  by heedlessness, sleep and indolence!"
"Sattwa attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while  Tamas,  shrouding  knowledge,  attaches  to heedlessness only!"
"Now Sattwa prevails, O Arjuna, having overpowered Rajas and Tamas; now Rajas, having overpowered Sattwa and Tamas; and now Tamas, having overpowered Sattwa and Rajas!"
"When,  through  every  gate  (sense)  in  this  body,  the wisdom-light shines, then it may be known that Sattwa is predominant."
"Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, longing—these  arise  when  Rajas  is  predominant,  O Arjuna!"
"Darkness, inertness, heedlessness and delusion—these arise when Tamas is predominant, O Arjuna!"
"If the embodied one meets with death when Sattwa has become predominant, then he attains to the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest."
"Meeting death in Rajas, he is born among those who are attached to action; and dying in Tamas, he is born in the womb of the senseless."
"The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattwic and pure; the fruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas."
"From Sattwa arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness  and  delusion  arise  from  Tamas,  and ignorance also."
"Those who are seated in Sattwa proceed upwards; the Rajasic dwell in the middle; and the Tamasic, abiding in the function of the lowest Guna, go downwards."
"When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas, knowing that which is higher than them, he attains to My Being."
"The embodied one, having crossed beyond these three Gunas out of which the body is evolved, is freed from birth,  death,  decay  and  pain,  and  attains  to immortality."
"What are the marks of him who has crossed over the three qualities, O Lord What is his conduct and how does he go beyond these three qualities."
"Alike in pleasure and pain, who dwells in the Self, to whom a clod of earth, stone and gold are alike, to whom the dear and the unfriendly are alike, firm, the same in censure and praise."
"The same in honour and dishonour, the same to friend and foe, abandoning all undertakings—he is said to have crossed the qualities."
"And he who serves Me with unswerving devotion, he, crossing  beyond  the  qualities,  is  fit  for  becoming brahman  ."
"Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the  science  of  the  Eternal,  the  scripture  of Yoga,  the dialogue  between  Sri  Krishna  and Arjuna,  ends  the fourteenth discourse entitled:"

Avoid pouring water onto bone dry soil. 
Water will only move through and  around  the  edges  of  your  planter  and  will  not  be absorbed by the roots.

"However, they require it in different quantity. "
"The quality also differ in different reasons for example, plants needs more water in summers as waters get easily evaporated. "
"That's why, we have to check the availabilities of water or moisture in soil. "
"When they are filled, they become stiff and your plant stands upright. "
"When there is a lack of water, the cells deflate and the plant looks wilted - a clear sign Notes your plant needs more water. "
Plants produce cellulose that help to keep its shape.
"Water slowly as soil absorbs, not too quickly "
Water the plants with less quantity and slowing increase. 
Water the roots from very close distance.
" if you water from the  height,  the  soil  spreads  and  plant  will  not  have  any support to stand on the ground. "
Water the root zone.
Water the plants when it is needed.

"They  all  started  singing together.  But you know how disturbing, it is if everyone sings at the same time. "
"King Ravivarma said, 'I cannot select the best singer if you all sing  together'. "
" Then  Ravivarma  asked  all  the  animals,  birds, reptiles, insects etc to register for the competition. "
"Wild animals, domestic animals and forest birds registered for the competition as all wanted to win the competition. "
"After everyone registered in the competition, the king started calling    them  one  by  one  on  the  stage  to  show  their  talent before the jury. "
It was really a great competition.  It continued for almost 4 - 5 days. 
"On the last day of the competition, they were all very eager to know the results. "
"This competition was very special.  They selected 7 animals and birds among all and not just one, out of thousands. "
In order to standardize the competition they said that the ''Swara'' will be made standard. 
"All singers, were asked to follow the norms and standards. "
"Peacock, cow, goat,  heron,  nightingale,  horse  and  elephant  were  selected winners. "
The jury fixed 7 Swaras corresponding these animal as follows: 
the rapturous sound of the peacock when rain clouds gather in the sky
the bellowing of a cow when her calf is separated from her  
the bleating of a goat in a flock 
the cry of a heron
the sound of the Indian Kokila (nightingale) in spring 
the neighing of a horse
the trumpeting of an elephant
Even today the Indian classical music is very much set to these standard Swaras. 
"A swara is the selected pitches from which the musician constructs the scales, melodies and ragas. "
Swara is a Sanskrit word that connotes a note in the successive steps of the octave. 
An octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with double its frequency. 
"In music, the pitch of a note means how high or low the note is. "
A swara is the selected pitch. 
"North Indian and South Indian classical music are two distinct traditions,  but  they  share  many  similarities  like  the  seven swaras. "
"Ancient Indians were deeply impressed by the spiritual power of music, and it is out of this that Indian classical music was born. "
Most music has at least 3 main elements. 
"The  melodies  of  Indian  music  are  based  on  ragas (in southern India, ragam). "
"Like a scale, the raga is a list of the notes that are used in a particular piece of music. "
Raga is a set of Swaras. 
"The  rhythms  of  Indian  music,  rather  than  being organized into short measures, are organized in long rhythmic cycles called talas (in southern Indian thaalam). There are more than 106 different talas. "
""
"In a performance, the rhythm has an important role as it gives texture and a sense of purpose to the melody. "
"Taal or Talas, literally a  clap,  is  the  term  used  in  the  Indian  Carnatic  music  for  the rhythmic pattern of any composition and for the entire subject of rhythm. "
Rhythm performs the role of a time counter. 
A Taal is a rhythmic cycle of beats on a percussive instrument. 
Each such pattern has its own name.  Each repeated cycle of Taal is called as avartana. 
"The  harmony  is  mainly  supplied  by  instruments such as the sitar, tanpura or santoor. "
Harmony in Indian classical music is mainly the result of the tanpura playing a combination of  the  tonic  (sa)  and  the  fifth  (pa)  or  fourth  (ma)  in  a  fixed pattern in the background. 
The Tanpura instrument has four long  strings. 
" The  strings  are  plucked  one  after  the  other, continuously throughout the music. "
"It takes about 5 seconds for one four-string cycle to be plucked, and although the drone itself  is constant. "
Songs and poems can be sung in different Ragas. 
"While singing if you add rhythm, song will be more enjoyable. "
With Raga and Tala any song will be really soothing. 
The  combination  of  Raga  and  Tala  set  to  a  song  makes  the music. 
"Ragas and Talas can be produced through vocal cords, instruments  etc.  "
"Whichever  Swara  you  are  singing  in  your voice can be replicated in Veena, Flute, Sitar, guitar, clarinet, keyboard,  violin  etc. "
" Whichever  Tala  is  being  indicated  in your voice can be produced on Tabala, Mridanga, Ghata, drums etc."

List  two  types  of  each  of  folk  songs and  music  of  the following states
"To most of us know that kitchen is a place, where food is cooked. "
"The food, we eat satisfy our hunger; gives us energy to do work and maintain our health and happiness. "
Mom cooks variety of dishes  that  we  eat  and  enjoy  every  day  and  on  festivals. 
 She cooks  special  dishes  for  guests  and  different  foods  during sickness. 
She calls my dadi when I suffer from fever or stomach ache; she goes to the kitchen do something 
and give me something to drink or eat and in short time I feel better. 
I salute her to keep all of us healthy and happy with food. 
I am curious to know what she adds in the food. 
I have to ask either my mom or my teacher. 
One fine day there was a lecture in my school on the same topic. 
The diet doctor told us many health benefits of food items which we eat on regular basis. 
She also warned us not to eat junk food as well as processed and packaged food. 
"She emphasized to have seasonal, local and fresh foods. "
"She also shared her childhood memories at her grandmother's place, how she grinds idli batter in stone pestle and mortar and cook sambhar in stone vessel on slow  fire. "
 I  was  recalling  the  difference  in  kitchen  and  food between my grandma house in village and my mom's kitchen in the city. 
"The  diet  doctor  told  us  when  you  can  memorize  the  names of  rivers,  mountains,  historical  places,  scientific  principles, mathematical  formulas,  don't  you  think  you  must  know the  ingredients  of  your  food  and  benefits  of  them. "
" To  learn something  about  different  kitchens  and  nutritional  and  health benefits  of  some  commonly  consumed  food,  this  lesson  is designed. "
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to:"
explain the food and its importance in our life;
differentiate traditional and modern food and kitchen;
listing of 20 items used in the kitchen; and
identify at least one health benefit of each ingredient.
The term 'food' refers to anything that we eat or drink and which nourishes  the  body. 
" It  includes  solid,  semi-solid  and  liquid."
"Food can be obtained from plant, animals and sea sources. "
"Hence there are plant foods, animal foods and sea foods. "
Each type of food has different proportion of nutrients. 
"and varies in colour, taste, flavour and appearance"
"Food contains mainly six nutrients, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and water. "
Many foods including spices and herbs contain some health protective compounds. 
Due to the presence of nutrients and health protective  compounds  food  performs  some  of  the  following functions
"Get energy to work, walk, jump, play etc. Grow and develop physically and mentally. "
Repair and revive body during rest and sleep. 
Protect the body from infection and diseases. Improve internal body functions. 
"When I entered the kitchen to more about kitchen and food, I found my many utensils to cook food and eat food. "
"Mom told me  that  chapati  is  made  on  tawa,  dal  in  pressure  cooker  and vegetables in either pressure cooker or karai. "
"Dry raw ingredients  like  pulses,  salt,  sugar,  tea  leaves  are  kept  in  suitable  size containers which are kept inside the cabinet. "
Salt and sugar are added to food to make food salty and sweet. 
 Fruits and vegetables and butter are kept inside the refrigerator to keep them fresh for long time. 
Since they contain more water they can spoil easily. 
Milk is also kept at low temperature and boiled 2-3 times in a day to avoid spoilage or kept in refrigerator and thus we buy milk daily. 
Mom also told me different types of foods which are used to prepare wide variety of dishes from chapati to halwa and dal to dhokla. 
"Broadly raw ingredients used in making different dishes include cereals, pulses, milk, meat, egg, fish, fruits, vegetables, sugar and fats and oils. "
"The cereals like wheat, jowar, bajra, ragi, oats, barley and rice, are used to make chapati, naan, bread, plain rice pulav etc. "
"They are  eaten  in  large  amounts  so  we  get  good  amount  of carbohydrates,  proteins,  vitamins  and  minerals. "
Whole  grains provide more nutrients including fiber while milling (removal of seed coat) reduces vitamins and fiber. 
Thus eating refined flour like maida is less nutritious. 
"Pulses are of many types such as chana, kabuli chana, rajmah, arhar,  moong,  urad,  massor. "
They  are  used  with  seed  coat  or without  coat. 
 Some  of  them  are  soaked  overnight  to  reduce cooking time. 
They are boiled or pressure cooked. 
They are good source of plant proteins. 
Germinated pulses are also used which provide extra vitamin C. 
"Milk and milk products such as  curd,  butter  milk,  paneer, cheese,  khoa  are  used  many people of all age groups and in sweet and salty dishes. "
"Indian sweets  like  burfi,  rosogulla, rabri, milk cake, kulfi are age old tasty dishes and even today relished worldwide. "
They are rich source of protein and calcium but poor source of iron and vitamin C. 
"Animal  foods  like  egg,  meat  and  fish  are  rich  in  fat,  protein, vitamins and minerals."
 but poor in fiber and carbohydrates. 
People eating these foods are called non-vegetarians. 
Fruits and vegetables are found in wide variety. 
They are very colourful and juicy. 
"Fruits are generally eaten raw like apple, mango,  banana,  watermelon. "
 Vegetables  are  usually  cooked before eating. 
"Potato, sweet potato, carrot are grown under the soil  and  contain  good  amount  of  starch  hence  called  starchy foods."
"Green leafy vegetables such as spinach, fenugreek (methi) are  good  source  of  vitamins and some minerals. "
They can spoil  faster  because  they contain  more  water. 
" Other vegetables  like  cauliflower, cabbage, beans, lauki, parwar also contain health promoting substances and add colour and variety in meal. "
Fats and oils are usually used to cook and fry the food. 
"Butter is usually used without cooking to add  flavour,  e.g. spread  on  the bread slice. "
Desi ghee is used to season dal or vegetables. 
Besides energy  it  contains  some  health protecting compounds. 
"Vegetables oils are obtained from soya bean, mustard, ground nut etc, "
they are used in cooking including frying. 
 Refining  of  vegetable  oils  reduces  health  protecting benefits. Solid fat like trans fat is very harmful to heart and other organs in the body. 
"Many people like to eat sweets after meal, on happy and festive occasion; "
"add sugar in tea, coffee and other drinks. "
White sugar is  used  which  is  only  simple  carbohydrate .
It should  be consumed in minimum amount. 
Jaggery and honey are also sweet but have some vitamins and minerals. 
Some foods like dry fruits and nuts are power house of nutrients and eaten for health promotion and health protection. 
Since they contain  high  amount  of  fat  and  other  components  they  are consumed in small amount only. 
Spices and herbs are commonly used to make our daily food appealing and tasty. But they contain many health promoting compounds thus they provide many health benefits.

She gives me milk. 
I will take the remaining milk after she gives it to her baby calf. 
 Rigveda  mentions  that  cows  were  milked.
This Veda also gives knowledge of those prayers by which cows probably give more milk.
Milk was offered to the God and also used in sacrifices. 
Kautilya Arthashastra  gives  norms  of  milking    according  to season. 
Ayurvedic texts give the properties of milk. 
Cowherds  apply oil to the udders of cow before milking them. 
The first stream of milk is offered to Goddess Earth.

The milk is collected in a pot. 
"Preetam asks 'Kaka, what should I do with the milk in the pot?  Ramu says, 'Boil the milk after taking it to your home on a gas stove. "
See that milk does not spill over. 
Then off the gas stove and allow milk to cool in the pot. 
"After the milk is cooled, one can pour it  in a glass, offer it is to God."
This offering is done as a thanksgiving gesture to the God.
The remaining milk is to be converted to curds. 
Preetam asks Ramu Kaka 'How to convert milk to curd? 
Ramu says 'put a small amount of lime or curds of the previous day  into the milk that has cooked.  Keep it for a night. The next day one gets curd. 
Bacteria in milk get it converted to curd.

By  churning  buttermilk  one  gets  butter. 
"After receiving the butter, it is offered to Lord Shri Krishna."
Then taken by oneself butter can be taken by young  person  as  well  as  by  old  people. 
 It  gives  strength  and nourishes the body. 
"Freshly churned butter is sweet, cooling, light to digest and confers intellect. "
Butter increases intelligence as well.
Old butter causes diseases due to its sour taste. 
Another product  of the cow is Ghee. 
It is called clarified butter. 
"When butter is put in a container and heated, it melts and becomes ghee. "
"Freshly formed ghee gives wisdom, "
"good skin features, memory, strength and nourishment. "
It cleanses the human body 
It is  also  used  as  an  obtain  for  offering  in  the  sacrificial fire. 
It is praised as life itself in Vedic times. 
One must employ fresh ghee in consumption  during meals daily at least a spoonful. 
There are two other products of a cow that are considered good. 
These are its urine and dung. 
"Ramu says ""in my young day just like you, my elders did  not have casting gas. "
They collected firewood from forest to make fire. 
The forest was full of wild animals. 
The cows had to be protected. 
So a separate shed was constructed for them. 
"Grass, straw and leaves of trees were given to the cows they chewed then throughout  the day and the waste products formed dung in their body. "
They release the dung and urine. 
Cow dung was collected in a bucket and smeared over the walls. 
The walls were plastered with cow dung.
It was also smeared in from the house using a broom. 
It is collected and used for cooking after drying.
The cow dung is made in circular form keeping the same thickness.

Cow  dung  should  not  be  allowed  to  accumulated  in  Goshala. 
"It must be collected and removed as early as possible, "
spread  out  in  the  sunlight  and  dried. 
This prevents fly and other insects.

Cow urine is very useful for agricultural works.
The  five  products  received  from  the  cow  as  discussed  above
"The  five  products  are milk,  cured,  ghee,  cow  dung  and  urine  "
These are  termed collectively as 'Panchagavya'. 
They enhance the body's immunity when used individually or collectively. 
Many diseases are cured by Panchagavya medicines.

"Earlier, Indian economy was based on  agriculture and agricultural products."
"But with changes of time,  the nature of industry has been changed."
"Now, the service industry  plays a major role in the Indian economy."
"In this lesson, we will  study about the types of industries and their nature of work."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
Explain different types of industries
Describe different industrial products.
"Industries are mainly divided into two kinds :Small-scale industries,Large-scale industries."
Our Industries  Small  and  large-scale  industries  help  in  the  development  of  the country.
They also provide employment to a large number  Notes  of  people.
"Depending  upon  the  raw  material  used,  they  can  be  classified  as"
Some  people  manufacture  articles  either  at  home  or  in  other  small  places  by  using  the  necessary  machinery.
Such  manufacturing units are called small-scale industries.
"Leather  work industry, pottery, carpentry and handloom industry are some  examples."
Industries which undertake the manufacturing of goods on a large  scale by employing a large number of workers and using big  machinery  are  called  large-scale  industries.
"Those  producing  sugar,  cement,  automobiles,  radio,  T.V. etc. are  large-scale industries"
"We  get  timber,  bamboo,  grass  and  medicinal  plants  from  the  forest."
"Based on these products wooden articles, boxes, match- sticks,  paper  and  medicines  are  manufactured  by  industries."

India is a country where agriculture is the main profession of the  majority of the people.
Food is the basic need of any person.
"Therefore, everyone must possess maximum information about  agriculture."
It is connected with our daily life.
"Even, if we are  not opting it as a profession in future, basic information will be  helpful in life."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
explain various agricultural operations
describe the methods to grow crops
learn techniques to protect crops
explain seasonal cropping patterns.
Agricultural  operations  include  various  steps.
Ploughing  and  harrowing are done before sowing.
"Once sowing is done, other  processes like irrigation, weeding, adding manures and fertilizers,  spraying of insecticides, cutting, harvesting, beating of cobs with  sticks, willowing and cleaning of grain, etc. are undertaken."
Then  the grains duly cleaned are stored in gunny or plastic bags and  sent to the market.
The farmers retain some of the grains for their  own domestic consumption.
It is very necessary to constantly watch the health and proper  growth of the crops.
This is to protect them from diseases.
For proper growth of crops it is necessary to provide manures and  fertilizers to the crops in the optimal doses.
It is also necessary to protect the crops  from birds and animals.
Spraying of insecticides and pesticides  helps protect the crops from insects and diseases.
There are mainly two types of crops depending upon the seasons  : Kharif crops and Rabi crops.
Crops that are sown at the beginning of the rainy season in the  month of June of July are called Kharif crops.
"For example, bajra,  rice, moong, groundnut, cotton, etc."
Crops  that  are  sown  in  the  winter  season  and  cut  before  the  summer season are called Rabi crops.
"For example, wheat, gram,  Notes  jowar etc."
Crops which grow on rain water are known as rain fed or Barani  Crops.
"For example, bajra, groundnut, cotton, pulses etc."
Those  crops  which  need  irrigation  are  called  Irrigated  Crops.
"For  example, sugra cane, banana, grapes, etc."
DO YOU KNOW
Observe the various crops grown in your surroundings in  different seasons and make a list of them.
Observe the process of harvesing in your area.
Name any two crops of Kharif and Rabi.

Explain various functions of food
Know  functions or different nutrients
explain nutritive components of various foods and
describe  the  process  to  choose  different  food  rich  in  a  nutrient.
It is dinner time.
Let us have a look at what these three families are eating.
"Ramu's family is having Rajmah, Bhindi, Subji, Boiled rice and Curd."
"At Velu's house, they are having Rasam, Lemon, rice, Curd and khichdi."
Hmm delicious  food.
What  is  being  cooked  in  your  house today? 
We all eat food.
"We may eat food of many varieties-roti, rice or dosa, meat or vegetables"
but food is imporant for all of us.
Let us try and understand the reasons why all human beings eat food.
 Can you list the reasons?  
The food that we eat performs three important functions
"These are :  Physiological function, Social function, Psychological function "
" All living beings whether man or animal, require food for their growth and development."
"Without food, there would be no life."
"Thus,  the  primary  function  of  food  is  physiological."
This  is fulfilled in the following ways.
 When we work we need energy.
"Even when we reset, we  need  some  amount  of  energy  to  carry  out  the  basic  body functions."
Food provides energy to the body.
A young child needs food to grow.
"Even when we are healthy, our body tissues need to be built and old tissues need replacement."
Food provides us the resistance to fight against the diseases.
"Food has always been a means of extending hospitality, good will and friendship amongst people in all cultures."
Exotic dishes are prepared and served to guests on special occassions.
"During festivals, it is seen in communities that each household prepares similary special foods which are shared."
"Thus, food brings people together and binds them in a special way"
thus giving food a very important social value.
Food also performs an important psychological function.
It is seen that we use food as a means of expressing our emotions.
 Gandhiji's hunger strikes effectively communicated his disagreement with the British policies.
They also touched the hearts of millions of Indians and motivated htem to actively join the freedom struggle.
Food  also  gives  us  a  sense  of  well  being  the  security.
Eating habits  of  poeple  have  been  known  ot  vary  in  different psychological conditions.
"For example, when nervous or under stress, some people keen eating continuously while others turn away from food."
"Thus,  food  has  many  more  functions  other  then  supplying nutrients for health."
 List the functions of food
"Besides being tasty, food must also be nutritious."
"In different foods,  cartain  substances  known  as  ""nutrients""  are  found  in varying degrees."
"There are five main nutrients found in all food stuffs. These  are  -  Carbohydrates,  Proteins,  fats,  mineral  and vitamins."
"In  order  to  make  food  nutritious,  there  must  be  a balanced consumption of all these."
"Such a diet is known as a ""Balanced Diet"" and is it essential for healthy living."
"Do you remember Ramu, Velu and Rahim?"
Let us go to their houses today and see what is cooking.
Ramu's  mother  is  a  very  good  cook.
Let  us  see  what  she has  cooked  today.
"Dal,  Gobi Aloo  Sabzi, Parantha,  Curd and Kheer too!"

"But food must not only be tasty, it must also be nutritious."
Do you remember the five nutrient components of food which make the food nutritious?
"Yes, they are : Carbohydrates,Proteins,Fats, Minerals  and  Vitamins"
All foods have these five nutrients but in varying amounts.
Certain foods are very rich in one or two of the above.
"Hence, they form rich sources of these nutrients in our diet."
For example : Milk and meat are rich sources of protein.
Each nutrient proforms an important  physiological  function.
"Hence,  our  diet  must  be  a balance  mix  of  all  these  nutrients."
Following  functions  are performed by each nutrient
These make the bulk of our diet & are our chief source of energy.
Main souces are :
"Cereal grains - wheat, rice, bajra."
"Tubers - potato, sweet potato."
"Sugar, Jaggery"
These  serve  as  the  major  source  of  body  building  material.
Proteins are found both in animals and plants.
"Main vegetarian sources  of  protein  are-Soyabean, pulses, cereals,milk, paneer, gound-nuts"
"Non-vegetarian sources of this are - meat, fish, eggs."
These are energy rich foods.
"Nuts such as groundnut, butter and ghee form milk, vanspati, vegetable oils are all rich sources of fat."
They are required for the maintenance of good health.

Let  us  observe  the  cooking  process.
"Some  foods  are  cooked  in  water,  and  others  in  oil."
"Yet,  others  are  cooked  on  direct  flame."
"Why do we cook at all, if we can eat raw food? "
Can  you  think  of  some  reasons for cooking food? 
Check to see if you can list all the reasons.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
Explain the reasons for cooking food

Cooked food is easy to digest
Take some wheat and try to eat it  raw.
Now take some wheat dough and Lets Cook  make a Roti.
A roti is easy to eat
Roti is easy to  digest
Is'nt it?
Cooking enhances the taste of food 
Try eating a raw potato or brinjal.
How does it taste?
"Now try the potato, chopped into small  pieces and sprinkle some salt and pepper on it."
Do you notice any  change from the raw form? Yes.
" the colour, taste, texture and the  flavour of the fried potato pieces would be much better then the  raw form."
Cooking adds variety to food 
Let us try and think or the various products which can be made with potatoes.
"Now let us write  down some of them - pakora, potato curry, potato parantha, dum  aloo, potato chaat..the list is long, indeed."
Cooked food has a longer shelf life
""
"Don't you think that the  boiled milk, cooked sarson ka saag stay for a longer time? "
"Oh! yes, definitely."
Perishable commodities like vegetables and milk  stay longer if cooked.
"But foods like dals, wheat, rice stay longer  when not cooked."
Cooking makes our food safe 
"Due to the application of heat during cooking, micro-organisms are killed by the heat."
This  makes the food safe for human consumption.
read carefully and tick for  the  true  and  the  false  statement
Cooking process kills the harmful micro-organisms.
The flavour of carrots does not change on cooking

"Ramu is having gobi-  praranthas, Velu Idli-sambhar, Rahim Samosas and Chutney."
"Idlis  are steamed, samosas fried and pranthas roased on a tawa."
So  cooking can be with
Moist heat - idli
Dry heat - parantha
Frying - Samosas
The question arises Why  is  cooking  done  by  various  methods?
"it  done  by  various  methods  provides  variety  in  the  taste,  flavour  and  texture."
Now let us study the various methods of cooking in greater details.
These can be boadly classified as
"Moist Heat ,Dry Heat, Frying"
Food is cooked with water as the cooking medium.
Let us list  down the methods of cooking with moist heat  
"Boiling ,Steaming, Pressure cooking"
Can you recall two things which are boiled? Yes.
Potato and rice are the two things which instantly  come to one's mind.
"After the potatoes are boiled, we discard the left-over water."
"For boiling rice, we use just sufficient amount of water,"
" the water is absorbed, when the rice is being cooked."
Use just sufficient amount of water 
water only cover the food product.
 keep this in mind
"If  excess  water  is  discarded,  we  loss  all  the  water  soluble  nutrients."
Put the food to be cooked in boiling water.
If  it  is  covered  with  a  lid  the  steam  quickens  the  cooking  process
beacuse of this reason the water does not evaporate.
"Use the left over liquid, rich in water soluble nutrients, for  making dals, curries, soups and for making dough."
the food to be cooked is not in contact with the  water
but is cooked in steam of the boiling liquid.
"Idli, dhokla  and  vegetables  are  some  of  the  items  which  are  cooked  by  steaming."
Steam will be formed only when the water boils.
"Use a light fitting lid, so that the steam is retained inside."
Food is light & easy to digest
"therefore, it is recommended for patients and the aged."
Oil or ghee is not used.
"Food is not overcooked, as it is a slow method of cooking "
 and food is not in direct contact with heat.
Here the food is cooked in steam under  pressure.
For this we use a special device called a pressure cooker.
The pressure cooker has a rubber gasket that seals the pain and  its lid
"thus, no steam escapes."
"Since the steam is under pressure,  the temperature attained is much higher and the food is cooked  much faster."
The weight (whistle) controls the pressure built up  inside the cooker.
"When the whistle blows, one should lower the  flame."
"Thus, temperature is controlled in the cooker and food  does not get burnt."
  Advantages of Pressure Cooking
Quick method.
Less water is used.
Nutrients and flavour are retained.
Hot air is used as a medium of cooking here.
This method is used  in
"baking,Roasting"
Food  is  cooked  in  a  tandoor  or  an  oven.
Heat  generated from the fire rotates around the food in the form of hot  air and this cooks the food.
"Some examples of baked products  are - cakes, bread etc."
How to make an oven at home
Take an empty oil tim & cut its upper lid.
Put a layer of mud and sand inside the tin.
"Now heat the tin on coal, gas or kerosene stove."
Put food to be cooked in this pot tin and put the lid on it.
Cook on slow fire.
Do not open the cover of the oven very frequently 
as cold air enters to make the food hard and dry.
A cooker put inside down on the flame can also be used as a  Tandoor.
Food to be cooked is in direct contact with heat 
"for eg.-hot air, sand, fire."
"are some other foods be which can roasted are- roti on tawa, brinjal in fire,Sweet potato, paneer, potato etc."
Hot oil is used as a medium for cooking here.
"When  we  fry  pakoras,  puris  or  samosas,  they  are  completely  immersed in oil."
This is called Deep Fat Frying.
It is a quick  method of cooking.
"How do we fry a parantha, dosa or an egg,a small amount of oil  is taken in a frying pan or tawa."
This is called Shallow Fat Frying.
More ghee is absorbed by this method or frying.
Always use oil which is hot for frying.
Food when put in cold  oil absorbs more oil  
"due to which food may get broken,"
"for example- cutlets, when put is cold oil making the oil dirty"
"Before frying, cover the food item to be fried with a layer of  maida, suji, egg or besan."
This helps to increase the flavour  and the taste of the food being cooked.
"Whatever oil is left after frying, should be strained and put in  a closed utensil"
 used for cooking as usual.
Tick for the statements that are true for pressure cooking  and for the statements which are false for pressure cooking
Quick method
No direct contact with water
Less water is used
No special equipment is needed for pressure cooking

"Yoga is a very ancient science that helps us not only to develop flexibility in our body, but also strengthens it."
It also brings happiness and peace of mind also
Yoga  believes that happiness is our natural state
"When the body and the mind are out of balance, we cannot experience this happiness"
"With the help of yoga poses, breathing exercises, focusing within and  meditation, we can bring back this harmony of body and mind, "
and achieve this natural state of happiness
"At  the  base  of  the  yoga  practice  are  the  following  five  basic principles: Proper exercise, Breathing, Relaxation, Diet, and Meditation"
"The practice of  Yoga has beneficial effects to every part of the body - muscles, joints, ligaments, blood circulation, digestion, etc"
We are what we eat
A proper diet should accompany a yoga practice to maintain a healthy physical body
"A diet of purely fresh, locally grown, and organic ingredients is recommended"
"Yoga emphasizes attention to breath, and taking long, deep inhalations that begin in the lower abdomen and fill up the entire chest cavity"
"This increases lung capacity and oxygen flow throughout the body, which clears and cleanses the mind"
One can achieve inner peace through proper relaxation leading to spiritual cleansing
The final but most important aspect of the yoga philosophy is positive thinking and meditation
"Meditation allows one a way to ease the constant chatter of the mind, and control it"
The basics of yoga according to the Upnishads : Our Upanishads says that our natural state is state of silence where our minds stops chattering
It is the state free of all thoughts or a state of peace
"When  your  mind  is  free  of  thoughts  it  is  a  state  of  bliss, knowledge and creativity"
Peace is important for all those who: are in search of greater and more permanent happiness and bliss
"seek knowledge, want to be totally free"
aspire to become more and more creative
An ideal society is one in which the above features are found
"It is constructed by setting up and observing the prescribed social norms and value system (Yamas and Niyamas) habits, customs, manners,  etiquettes,  etc"
These  will  help  us  to  move  in  the direction of peace
You have to work for such a spiritual setup.
You need to create such a environment where all individuals progress towards their goal of peace and the achievement of the required social values
You must work towards the creation of an Spiritualy Inclined Environment
"With  such  a  spiritual  background,  you  are  free from  over  stimulation,  unhealthy  competition,  comparison, stress and pressure to achieve unrealistic targets"
"Each soul is potentially divine as Swami Vivekananda puts it, every child is differently gifted"
Through yogic practices we should calm down our mind and nurture our area of interest and talent to achieve our potential
Yoga brings perfect equilibrium and harmony in the body and advances the mind making it powerful.
Dhyana reduces the fickleness of the mind and can control well

What are the objectives of Yoga? What are the basics of Yoga?
"Dear learner, Patanjali has given Ashtanga Yoga or eight steps of yoga."
"Those eight steps are Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi."
The first two steps that Patanjali describes are the fundamental ethical rule or code called Yamas and the Niyamas.
These can also be looked at as universal moral principles and personal observances.
Yamas deal with right personal attitude.
Niyamas are social disciplines as to how we deal with people around us.
It is advised we should match our inner attitude with the external action.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to : explain the basics of Yamas;"
list the types of Yamas;
explain the basics of Niyamas;
and list the types of Niyamas.
"Yama is mainly classified in five types : Ahimsa (non- violance), Satya (truth fullness), Asteya (non-sterling), Brahmcharya (chastity) and Aparigraha (non-possesiveness)."
Lets understand with story.
"One can hurt a person in three ways namely, by deeds, by words or by thought! All three forms of hurting are not good and one should avoid these."
Sometimes we hurt others without realizing it.
"Normally, you do harm without thought."
"One throw stones at animals without any reasons, catch insects, butterflies etc."
This is a pass time which gives much pain to these creatures.
Our shastras say that such acts invite punishment.
Here is a story which illustrates this law.
"In the past, there was a pious Maharshi called Mandavya."
He spent whole of his time in the forest doing Tapas.
He used to observe silence for long periods.
One day thieves entered the palace of the king of the land and stole some jewels.
"The guards woke up but before they could catch them, the thieves ran away with the jewels."
"The guards chased them and the thieves entered the forest, They then saw the Maharshi "
"Due to fear of guards, they dumped all the jewels near the Maharshi and escaped with their lives."
The guards saw the Maharshi with the eyes closed and all the stolen jewels lying in a heap near him.
They concluded that the Maharshi was the leader of the robbers and they presented him before the king along with the jewels.
The king was convinced that the Maharshi was guilty and ordered that he be put to death by being pierced by a spear.
"At the time of death, the Maharshi suddenly remembered that during his childhood he used to amuse himself by catching insects and pricking them with thorns and that the punishment that he was undergoing was the result of that sin."
He immediately instructed his disciples who were present there to be non-violent always.
We should therefore never willfully harm any creature however small it may be.
"Satya means ""to speak the truth,"" yet it is not always desirable to speak the truth on all occasions."
Because it could harm someone unnecessarily.
"We have to consider what we say, how we say it, and in what way it could affect others."
"If speaking the truth has negative consequences for another, then it is better to say nothing."
Let us understand the Satya by a story.
One day a wood cutter's axe accidentally fell into a river.
The poor wood cutter made a good search in the water.
But his efforts were in vain.
"Finally, he burst into tears."
"Hearing his sobs, God appeared before him."
The God disappeared into the river and came up carrying a golden axe.
The wood cutter did not accept it.
He stated that his axe was not made of iron.
God disappeared and soon returned with a silver axe.
The wood cutter again denied that it was his axe.
God once again plunged into the river.
It soon reappeared carrying the axe of the wood cutter.
He greeted the God with words of profuse thanks and great joy.
God was impressed by the man's honesty.
He presented him with the golden and silver axes in recognition of his truthful nature.
Asteya is a third part of Yama.
"Asteya means ""not to steal""."
"Lack of gratitude can fuel an unhealthy desire for things that we don't currently have, such as name brand clothes, or the most supped up car."
"The root cause of asteya comes from the thinking, ""I'm not good enough,"" and ""I don't have enough."" "
The need to steal essentially arises because of the lack of faith in ourselves to be able to create what we need by ourselves.
"The moment we feel a sense of ""lack"" in life; desire, want and greed emerge."
This steals our own contentment away from the things that we have now that are bringing purpose and happiness to our life.
Let us understand the Asteya by a story.
There was a diamond thief who stole only the most precious gems 
He spotted a well-known diamond merchant purchasing the most beautiful diamond and decided to steal it.
"He spent his entire time, trying to find the diamond, but despite all his endeavors he failed to locate it."
"When the train reached its destination the thief, restless in his incapacity, could not contain himself and told the merchant the truth;"
"Sir, I've been following you everywhere for the last three days trying to find the rare gem you purchased. I have not been able to get my hand on it."
Please tell me where you hide it .
"The merchant said: ""When I first saw you, I suspected you were a pickpocket "
and so hide the gem where I thought you'd never look-in your own pocket!
And with that he reached into the thief's pocket and brought out the amazing gem which was in the thief's possession all along.
"The above story of the thief and merchant shows that whatever we want to steal and are desperately seeking, is in our own pocket."
All we have to do is look!
"Aparigraha means to take only what is necessary, "
and not to take advantage of a situation or act greedy.
"We should only take what we have earned; if we take more, we are exploiting someone else."
Let us understand the Aparigraha by a story 
There is another great story about the wisdom of Tenali Rama.
"The famous King of Vijayanagar, Krishnadevaraya's, mother was a very pious and orthodox lady."
She had visited all holy places and given much of her treasures in charity to temples.
"Once she showed the desire of giving away the fruits in charity and her son, the king, obliged."
"Unfortunately, his mother died. Krishnadevaraya followed all religious rites."
"On the last day, the king called some brahmins and said, 'my mother's last wish was to offer mangoes to brahmins."
But she could not fulfil this wish and died.
What can I do so that my mother's last wish could be fulfilled and she can rest in peace?'
"The brahmins were greedy. They said that only if the king would give each brahmin a gold mango, would his mother be able to rest in peace."
Krishnadevarya on hearing this immediately ordered some gold mangoes to be made 
"and presented them to the Brahmins, thinking now his mother would be happy and peaceful."
There was a minister called Tenali Rama and he heard about this.
He called those brahmins to his home to perform the last rite ceremonies of his own mother.
All the brahmins came to Tenali's house. 
Tenali closed all the doors and windows and stood in front of them with a red hot iron rod.
"The brahmins were taken aback, but Tenali removed their confusion and told 'My mother had knee pains'"
And as a remedy she wanted me to cure her with these hot iron rods.
But she died before I could help her.
"So now I want to fulfil her wish by giving you all this treatment', Tenali said to the brahmins."
The greedy brahmins understood that they have not done right and they returned the mangoes to the King.
"Later, Tenali Rama told king Krishnadevarya that the treasure of the palace should not be exploited by giving them to such greedy people."
"Instead, it should be put to feed and serve the needy."
"The above, story of three bhramin's shows you that one should not be greedy."
And also shouldn't take more than they need.
"Niyama means ""rules"" or ""laws"" which should be followed "
These are the rules prescribed for personal observance.
"Like the Yamas, the five Niyamas are not exercises or actions to be simply studied."
They represent far more than an attitude.
"The first Niyama is Saucha, meaning purity and cleanliness."
Shaucha has both an inner and an outer aspect.
Outer cleanliness simply means keeping ourselves clean.
"Inner cleanliness has as much to do with the healthy, free functioning of our bodily organs as with the clarity of our mind."
Let us understand the Shaucha by a story.
"In a village there were three best friends - Mohan, Lalith and Arjun."
They studied in the same school.
All the three were good in their studies.
They all liked the school.
It was the place where they all met.
They never missed school.
Their village was very beautiful. Many tourists visited this place.
Once Arjun didn't come to school for five days.
Lalith and Mohan were worried.
They decided to visit Arjun.
They were shocked to see the place where he lived. It was very dirty.
When they reached Arjuns house they saw that he was down with very high fever.
His mother was crying badly.
"Arjun looked very soft and tired, He could hardly talk."
Malaria is a disease that is spread by mosquitoes.
His father told them that due to unhealthy living conditions very few tourists visited the place.
The next day the boys told the class about Arjun.
They decided to do something for their friend.
So they decided to clean the place during the weekend.
So the students gathered in the street and divided themselves into small groups and started cleaning the place.
"They swept the roads, collected the waste and threw it in the dustbin. They also cleared the dirty water."
"Thus, the mosquitoes became less."
They continued the cleaning process every week.
This was an eye opener for the people staying around.
They slowly started participating in the cleaning spree.
All were happy and the place became clean and tidy.
Very few people fell sick.
Tourists started visiting the village as before.
The principal appreciated the children in the assembly.
The district collector too appreciated the children for making the people aware.
The cleaning effort of the people of the village was shown on the TV.
Many states also adopted the cleaning movement.
Thus a small movement that started in a small village spread to the whole country.
"Finally, even the President one day declared that our India is a clean India."
"If we want our country to be a clean and healthy place to live,"
 we should first keep our house and surroundings clean.
"Not only external cleanliness, but internal cleanliness is also needed."
"Another Niyama is Santosha, modesty and the feeling of being content with what we have."
"To be at peace within and content with one's lifestyle, finding contentment, even while experiencing life's difficulties for life becomes a process of growth through all kinds of circumstances."
Let us understand the Santhosha by a story.
"Once, there was a king named Kushala."
He was a very kind king.
"He had everything, wealth, health, army, etc."
Kushala was the most powerful king.
"The only problem was that, he was not contented with whatever he had."
"As he was a kind king, the God gave him a blue magical crystal."
"Through it, King Kushala was able to transform into anything."
"As it was the day time, the sun was very bright and shiny. The king became jealous."
"With the help of the magical crystal, he transformed himself into the sun."
Suddenly there were clouds everywhere in the sky.
The clouds didn't even allow a single ray of the sun to reach the ground.
"The king was angry with the clouds, so he transformed into the clouds."
He had fun floating in the air.
"Suddenly, there was a mountain in his way."
"He thought that the mountain is stronger than a cloud. Thus, he turned into a mountain."
Suddenly there were some stone cutter coming to cut the stone from the mountain.
They began to cut down the stone from the mountain.
The king thought again that the stone cutters that follow the rules of the king are stronger than a big mountain.
"With the help of the magical crystal, he transformed into a stone cutter."
His king gave him the order to cut some stone and bring it to his soldiers.
"Finally, he decided to be a king again."
By the above story we can understand that being contented with what we have is very important.
Tapas refers to the activity of keeping the body fit 
and handle the inner urges without outer show.
"Literally, it means to heat the body and, by so doing, to cleanse it."
Behind the notion of Tapas lies the idea we can direct our energy to enthusiastically engage life and achieve our ultimate goal of creating union with the Divine.
Let us understand the Tapas by a story.
There is an inspiring story in the Kathopanishad about a little boy named Nachiketa.
He was the son of Udalak Rishi.
Once Udalak organized a yajna to please the deities.
It was customary in those days to donate cows to brahmins at the end of the Yajna.
Udalak was a miser brahmin
he donated old and weak cows to the brahmins.
None of the cows yielded any milk.
This disturbed Nachiketa.
"He asked his father about it, ""Father, to whom would you give me in charity?"" "
"This made his father very angry, but he decided not to say anything."
"When Nachiketa repeated the question, Udalak lost his temper and said, ""I give you to Yama."" "
He reached the Yama's kingdom and was told by Yama's guards that he had gone out for three days.
Nachiketa decided to wait on his doorstep till he returned.
"He waited for three days. No food, no water."
Yama returned on the fourth day and saw little Nachiketa at his doorstep.
"He felt pained for keeping a brahmin waiting without welcoming him, without food and water."
"Nachiketa declared, ""My first wish is, when I return home may my father welcome me lovingly."
My second wish is to grant me the knowledge by which I can be worthy of living in the heavens.
"My third wish is to grant me Atmagnanam -knowledge of the Atma."""
This story also inspires us to be kind to all creatures and to respect one's parents.
The fourth Niyama is Swadhyaya.
Swa means ‘self’ Adhyaya means ‘inquiry’ or ‘examination’.
You all know who Guru Dronacharya was ?
He was the royal Guru (teacher) of the Pandavas and Kauravas.
He used to teach military art to the princes.
"Once, a boy named Ekalavya asked Guru Dronacharya, ""Gurudev, will you teach me the art of archery?"" Ekalavya aspired to study archery in the gurukul of Dronacharya, the greatest known teacher."
Dronacharya was in a dilemna as he had promised King Bhishma that he will teach this art only to the princes.
"Ekalavya was not a prince, so Dronacharya was hesitant to teach him and he duly conveyed his refusal to Ekalavya."
"Deeply sad by Dronacharya's rejection, Ekalavya returned home."
"After practicing for years together, Ekalavya eventually became an exceptional archer."
Once Guru Dronacharya took the Pandava and Kaurava princes to the forest for practicing archery.
A dog was also accompanying them.
Dronacharya was amazed to see the dog's state.
He was wondering how such a success could be achieved.
"Dronacharya and his students investigated, and came upon Ekalavya, practicing archery."
"On seeing Dronacharya, Ekalavya was filled with joy. He bowed down to him."
"Dronacharya asked Ekalavya, ""Where did you learn archery?""."
"Pointing towards the clay statue, Ekalavya replied, ""Under you, O Guru."" "
Ekalavya had learnt archery by self introspect and effort with immense devotion and reverence towards his Guru Dronacharya.
"From the above, story of Ekalavya we can understand how he got mastery over archery through his Swadhyaya or self introspect."
In the previous lesson you have learnt Yama and Niyama with the help of relevant stories.
"You have understood that, Yamas are personal disciplines or restraints and Niyamas are social disciplines or observances."
Now in this lesson we are going to learn about the Asana and Pranayama.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to : explain the terms Asana and Pranayama;"
list the types of Asana and Pranayama;
describe the objectives and benefits of Asana and Pranayama;
and adopt the correct procedure for undertaking Asana and Pranayama.
"Our ancient rishis of India based on their observations of nature - animals, birds etc. devised a number of asanas or postures."
"It is not by mere chance in Hatha yoga terminology, all the postures are named after the different animals of the jungle."
"Each posture or pose, whether the lion, camel, cat or peacock, has a purpose of its own."
Asana literally means 'seat'.
"An asana is a body posture, originally a sitting pose for meditation, "
"and later in hatha yoga and modern yoga as exercise, adding reclining, standing, inverted, twisting, and balancing poses to the meditation seats."
All asanas should be done by observing the stability - Sthiram.
Remember that all yogic postures or the yogasanas are performed slowly and with stability.
Asana is a gift given to us by ancient sages.
By regular practice of these Asanas one can live a long and healthy life.
"For doing these Asanas, one needs to learn to focus on the pose."
 and learn to align the body correctly in relation to how it functions.
"Alignment, balance and strength are key factors of all asanas."
Helps maintains flexibility and strength of muscular-skeletal system.
Increases concentration and focus by calming the mind.
Improves the function of vital organ systems.
"Promoting flexibility of the spine leading to ease in forward bending, backward bending and side bending."
All asanas helps you and some of the asanas also helps to culture your personality.
Asanas are classified in the following manner: 
Standing Asanas - In standing asanas the body is supported on the soles of your feet.
Sitting Asanas - In sitting Asana the body is supported on the buttocks.
Prone Asanas - Prone asanas refers to lying face down and the body is supported on your stomach.
Supine Asanas - Supine asanas refers to lying in a face up position with the body supported by your back.
"Ásanas are also be classified as : Cultural, Relaxation, and Meditative postures."
"The Shavásana, the Makarásana (the crocodile postures), Shithila Tadasana and Shitila Dandasana are called relaxation postures."
"While the Padmásana, Siddhásana, the Vajrásana and the Sukhásana are known as the meditative postures."
All the remaining postures are called cultural postures.
These postures are meant essentially to develop the personality.
"To develop confidence, to overcome shyness and to become confident and dynamic, it is advised to practice the cultural asanas,"
"especially that involve back bending postures and the Chakrásana, Bhujangásana (the cobra postures)."
The Ardha Chakrásana (standing bending backward) and Suptavajrásana are also good.
These practices strengthen the chest and shoulders.
"People who are egoistic, are observe to always hold their shoulders back and heads up."
"For such people, humility can promoted by practicing the front bending postures like Paschimottánásana, Shashankasana, Padahastásana."
These are prescribed to help overcome the egotistic characters and to develop a pleasing and warmer personality.
Prana means ‘energy’ and Ayama is ‘to regulate’.
Pranayama is the practice by which one can regulates the vital energy.
Pranayama helps to make the breath slow and rhythmic.
"When the breath slows down, mind becomes calm."
It is the practice of using the breath to soothe the fluctuations of ‘chitta’ or the active thinking mind.
There are four types of Pranayama
Kapalabhati is one of the yoga vitalizing prnayama.
Kapalbhati' means 'shining forehead' in sanskrit.
Nadi Shuddhi pranayama is a blancing pranayama 
It is done through alternate nostril breathing.
Shuddhi means ‘to purify’.
The practice balances the flow of breath through both the right and left nostrils.
Anluloma Viloma Pranayama is a cooling Prnayama.
It is done in which both inhalation and exhalation is done through left nostril.
"Along with the examples, list of the different types of Asanas "
"Along with the examples, list of the different types of Pranayams"
What are the suggested guidelines for practicing Pratahara?
Explain the method of practicing Dharana.
Explain the special features of Dhyana.
Yoga is a discipline to improve or develop one's inherent power in a balanced manner.
It guide and offers the means to attain complete self-realization.
The literal meaning of the sanskrit word yoga is 'Yoke'.
Yoga can therefore be defined as a means of uniting the individual spirit with the universal spirit of god.
"In this lesson you will learn about Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to, explain the terms Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi, list the special features and benefits of Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi "
"And adopt the correct procedure for practicing, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi."
"Pratyahara is derived from the sanskrit word - prati, meaning ‘away’ or ‘against’, and ahara, meaning ‘nourishment’ or ‘food’."
"Therefore, the whole word denotes a withdrawal from what nourishes the senses."
Pratyahara means ‘withdrawal of the senses’.
"It's a powerful way to master your mind, cultivate inner peace, and boost your focus and concentration."
"Before we can actually teach kids to control their senses, they need to understand what they are required to do ."
"Start by identifying the five senses— sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell."
"Pratyahara is considered important in yoga helping the practitioner into concentration, meditation and, eventually, to the goal of samadhi (union with the Divine)."
"By withdrawing the focus from the senses and the external environment, the mind can turn inward, deepening yogic practice."
The main objective of Pratyahara is about training the mind to withdraw from the senses.
It allows the mind to be peaceful so that good concentration can be developed.
It helps to stay away from distraction or disturbance.
"This is crucial, especially at the beginning, and reduce the physical stimuli as much as you can."
"Sit comfortably on a chair, on the floor, or try to get into any other comfortable position of your choice."
"Probably it is not a good idea to lie down, because if you do, you might fall asleep."
"Remember, the idea is to remain conscious and not to doze off."
"Pratyahara is not relaxation, it is an exercise of awareness."
Close your eyes and try to move your body as little as possible for about 10 minutes.
Avoid gossips and negative talks.
Gossip is a bad thing for children. 
"Especially when done with the intention is to say or spread words that are hurtful, damaging to a one's feelings or reputation."
Associate with good friends.
Once there was a fruit seller.
He had a few mangoes in his basket.
"All the mangoes were good, except the one, which was rotten."
"He thought, 'If I leave this rotten mango in the basket full of good mangoes then that rotten mango too would turn to good'."
"So, he left the rotten mango in the basket full of good mangoes."
"However, a week later, when he opened the basket, he was shocked to see that, contrary to his expectation, all the good mangoes had become rotten."
"Keep this point in mind, and always try to remain in the company of good and well-mannered friends."
Observing the nature helps create a sense of wonder in you.
Which you can carry over to other aspects of your life.
Being out in nature helps children to become more aware.
Nature gives you the chance to engage all the senses.
"Enjoy the rising sun, full moon, gaze at the tree, observe the birds, listen to the chirping of the birds etc."
Singing and music play an important role in our culture.
Especially singing and listening to bhajans.
"Right from birth, parents instinctively use music to calm and soothe children, to express love and joy, and to engage and create interaction."
Inculcate a sense of appreciation for Indian classical music. 
"Try to learn Tabla, Sitar, Santoor or Harmonium etc."
These will have a great impact on developing positive aspect of the personality.
Observe your feeling before food and while having food.
"You must be fond of food items such as vada-pav, pav-bhaji, pizzas, chinese food, biscuits, potato chips and cold drinks."
But are you aware of the adverse effects of consuming these items in excess? 
These have a harmful effect on our mind and body.
We think on the basis of whatever we eat and in turn act according to what we think.
Let us understand this with the help of this story.
"Once, a Monk committed a theft at king's palace after having his meal."
The king was shocked at this incident and sought to find out how even a Monk could commit a theft.
"While investigation, he found out that the cook who had prepared that day's meal had committed a theft."
"In this way, the food served, became a medium to pass the bad habit."
"Homemade food is fresh, healthy and easy to digest."
Not only it satisfies our hunger but also provides us with good nutrition.
Wash your hands and legs before eating your lunch.
"Before having food, pray to Kuladevata (Family Deity) or the Upasyadevata (Deity of worship)."
Do not talk in between while having your food.
Have food with a pleasant mind thanking the supreme for the food.
"Finish all the food in your plate, do not waste anything."
"By withdrawing focus from the senses and the external environment, the mind can turn inward ."
"Pratyahara is not relaxation, it is an exercise of awareness."
Nature gives you the chance to engage all the senses.
For Pratyahara close your eyes and try to move your body as little as possible for about 10 minutes.
It is one-pointed concentration.
"It is fixing one' s full attention at one place, object, or idea at a time."
Dharana is the ability to bring the mind into focus and to hold the concentration on a single point.
"In true dharana all body-consciousness and restless thoughts cease, enabling one to focus on the object of meditation without distraction."
"The mind will be free within the periphery of this area, but it should not cross the boundary."
This exercise is known as Dharana.
To understand this definition let us read this story:
A farmer own a calf.
The calf want to roam around in different directions.
"To control the calf from such wandering in different directions, it was not possible to tie it up to a particular point."
So the farmer tie a cord of certain length to its neck and then ties the other end of the cord to a hook in the ground.
"The calf freely moved in the circle, the radius being the length of the cord, but cannot go out of that circle."
Thus the farmer had a control on the calf and also the calf is not at a loss either.
Because it gained a controlled freedom.
This attitude and the idea is important.
"The mind, which is just like the calf wants to roam around everywhere, it is not possible to engage it at a particular point or location."
"Dharana is focusing on a single point which could be - your breath, a mantra, a word, or any object."
"In the beginning, focusing of the mind is difficult."
Therefore a beginner can start meditating for a few minutes only and later on can increase its duration.
Concentration is direction of attention to a single object.
We all have the ability to concentrate.
"Think of the times when you watch movies, play games, it is total concentration."
But at other times your thoughts are scattered.
Your mind jumps from one thing to another.
It's for those time that you need to learn and practice concentration.
"Learning a skill takes practice whether it is dancing, writing, or concentrating."
"The practice of concentration can be developed by performing asanas, breathing practices, pranayama and meditation."
Dharana trains your mind to be attentive and attain aware.
Sitting quietly observing your breath.
"Sitting in Padmasana, close your eyes and observe your inhalation and exhalation."
As you inhale your abdomen bulges out and as you exhale the abdomen sinks.
"Do A-U-M chanting, chanting (A-kara , U-kara, M-kara, A-U-M) in a sequence and focusing on the picture of OM will help you in Dharana or focusing."
Dhyana is a sanskrit word meaning ‘meditation’.
"It is derived from the root words, dhi, meaning ‘receptacle’ or ‘the mind’; and yana, meaning ‘moving’ or ‘going’."
"Unfortunately, the word dhyana is usually translated as meditation, implying a state of calm."
Let us briefly see what dhyana is.
"Earlier to practicing dhyana, the relevant steps of yoga, namely, Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, and Dharana should be practiced."
"It helps you to get rid of negative emotions like fear, anger and develops positive emotions like love, compassion, friendliness and cheerfulness."
Meditation keeps the mind calm and quiet.
"It increases concentration, memory, clarity of thought and will power."
It rejuvenates the body and mind.
"Samadhi is derived from the sanskrit, sam, meaning ‘together with’ ‘completely’ and dha, meaning ‘put’."
It means a complete state of concentration.
"According to system of Patanjali, samadhi is the eighth and final step in the meditative process."
"It is that before the self is released from its self-ignorance and enters the ultimate condition of kaivalya, ‘aloneness’."
"In samadhi, the process of concentration, the object of concentration, and the mind that is trying to concentrate or meditate all become one."
The mind is no longer focusing on the object in an objective manner.
Samadhi is sometimes called self-realization.
Self-realization means getting to know yourself better.
"In the process, you learn to love yourself more."

You all have the ability to concentrate.
"Think of the times when you watch movies, play games, it is total concentration."
"But at other times your thoughts are scattered, and your mind jumps from one thing to another."
It's for those times that you need to learn and practice concentration.
"Learning a skill takes practice, whether it is dancing, writing, or concentrating."
"The practice of concentration comes by performing asanas, breathing practices, pranayama and meditation."
These practices train your mind with attention and awareness.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to- improve memory and concentration by stimiulate brain and nervous system."
"Practice Asanas, Pranayama and Breathing practices."
Practice yoga technique.
Breathing practices are to normalize the breathing rate.
"And to make the breathing uniform, continuous and rhythmic, breathing practices re essential."

"Hands stretched out over the head, biceps touching the ears and palms facing the ceiling."
"While inhaling slowly raise both the legs without bending at the knees, as far as comfortable."
While exhaling return the legs to the floor as slowly as possible.
In this Sthiti there is a chance to fall down too rapidly as both legs come close to the floor.
So use strength and have control over the movement.
"Take the hands behind the back, make a fist of the right hand and hold the right wrist with the left hand."
While inhaling bend backwards from the waist opening up the chest.
While inhaling slowly come up to the vertical position and then slightly lean backwards.

Padahastasana comes from the sanskrit word Pada which means foot and hasta means hand.
Viparitakarani in derived from sanskrit word viparita which means inverted or reversed.
It is also cleansing technique.
There are six Kriyas which helps to cleanse various internal organs.
"Here in this lesson we will learn about Kapalabhati, which is used for cleansing frontal lobe."
"In sanskrit, Kapala means ‘skull’ and bhati means ‘shine’."
"So, it helps to improve the functions of the organs located in the skull."
Adopt Nasika mudra close the leftt nostril with the ring finger.
Practice rapid breathing with active and forceful exhalation and passive inhalation.

Inhale passively by relaxing the abdominal muscles at the end of each exhalation.
Repeat the exhalation as quickly as possible at the rate of 60 strokes per minute.
"At the end of one minute, stop the practice."
Now observe an automatic suspension of breath.
"In fact, there will be no urge for breathing for a few seconds."
Simultaneously the mind may experience a deep state of silence.
Enjoy this state of deep rest and freshness.
Pranayama popularly known as yogic breathing.
It consists of the breathing techniques which are related to the control of breath or respiratory process.
"It helps to increase your concentration and attention, creates awareness, brings relaxation, reduces stress and increases lung capacity."
"Dharana is focusing on a single point which could be your breath, a mantra, a word, or any object."
Therefore a beginner can start meditating for a few minutes only and later on can increase its duration.
Let us focus on a beautiful flower and practice Dharana.
Sit comfortably cross-legged.
Place your hands face down on your knees and close your eyes for a moment.
"Let your next in breath fill up your belly, and roll your shoulders up to your ears."
Let your next out breath empty your belly and drop your shoulders away from your ears.
"If you'd like, you can open your mouth on the out breath."
"Now that we are comfortable and tuned into our breath, we can begin our concentration activity."
"Gently open your eyes and find a flower, close your eyes halfway and see how long you can focus on the flower without blinking or closing your eyes all the way."
"Try to take in every part of the flower, including its color and shape."
"When you need to blink, close your eyes and imagine the flower that you were just concentrating on."
Can you remember the color and the shape of the flower?
See if you can keep it at the front of your mind as a picture.
"Focus on the picture, you just created until it fades away, once this happens, you can slowly open your eyes."
See how well you remembered the flower that was in front of you.
"In the practice of Dharana, it is single point focus."
We train our mind to stay at present and connect to one thing.
"The object of connection is just a tool to help with the practice and can be anything, from candle, to a mantra."
The whole point in practicing Dharana is to notice when the mind wanders and get in the habit of bringing back to the object of focus.
"At some point in this practice, when the sustaining of the attention becomes effortless and for a long time, we slip from the practice of Dharana into the state of Dhyana."
"Now let us continue our Dharana or focusing, make it effortless, which is Dhyana."
"Choose a flower, set it about a foot in front of you at a comfortable angle, preferably at eye level."
"Examine the flower to see what it actually looks like, with all of its specific contours and curves, textures, and colors."
Close your eyes for a minute or so.
"Can you still see its image in your mind, or feel its presence in front of you?"
See how well you remembered the flower that was in front of you.
Bhramari is derived from bhramara which means black humming bee.

1. INTERDEPENDENCE OFORGANISMS
"Everything, organisms and plants are dependent on each other."
They are connected together.
"Nature has made us in a way thathumans, plants, animals and organisms are connected to eachother."
This makes a balance in nature.
If one of them slips out orget separated then the chain gets destroyed.
"For example, you all must have seen an earthworm."
They aremostly found in rainy or moisture land.
Do you know that theyare very helpful in making soil fertile?
They make soil hollowand fertile for agriculture. This helps in high production.
"In thisway, earthworm, soil and crops are related to each other."
We willread about some related components of nature in this lesson.
After reading this chapter you will be able to:
Know about the inter dependence of plants and animals
Explain the balance of nature.
List the causes of natural imbalance.
Tell the correct method of using natural resources
1.1 HOW ARE PLANTS AND ANIMALSCONNECTED TO EACH OTHER
We all know that plants prepare food by the process ofphotosynthesis in the presence of sunlight.
In this way greenplants are dependent on animals.
"On the other hand, animalscannot prepare their own food. They are dependent on plants fortheir food directly or indirectly."
"For example, bees are dependent on flowers to prepare honey."
They get pollen grains flowers and stick from one flower toanother. This process is called pollination.
"In this way, plants getbenefit from bees and bees get benefited from plants for honey."
This is called interdependence.
"In the same way, butterfly andplants are also dependent on each other."
1.2 DEPENDENCE OF ANIMALS ONEACH OTHER
There are many organisms which are dependent on each other.
"For example, some organisms and protozoa present in foodpipe of termites."
These organisms are not the food of termitesbut they are helpful in digesting the wood eaten by termites.
"Inthis way, termites get digestible food and microorganism getfoodand place to live."
Have you seen any bird sitting on buffalo's back or cow's back?
Have you seen them eating something from there? Indeed.
Thesebirds and animals sit and eat small insects.
This helps animals ingetting rid of insects and birds get food too.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 1.1
1. Write the name of any one thing that we get from animals?
2. What does bee get from plants? What does plant get frombee?
1.3 NATURE'S BALANCE
"Every organism needs food to live,"
you know that big animalseat small or less powerful animals by hunting.
In the same way the powerful animals eat animals smaller to them.
This makes achain called food chain.
"Imagine a small jungle (forest) where only plants, deer and lion live."
What will happen if all lions arekilled in the jungle?
This will increase the number of deer inthe jungle.
There will be a time when all the plants will be eatenby the excess population of the deer.
"After plants end, all deerwill too die of hunger."
Note and observe how the excess or shortage of any organismcan harm the natural balance.
This has a bad effect on all theorganisms.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 1.2
1. If all the snakes of the garden are killed then what willhappen?
2. If all the plants of a garden are destroyed then what willhappen?
1.4 NATURAL IMBALANCE
You all must have heard from your parents and elders that ournature is not clean as it used to be.
We read in news papers thathow much air is polluted in the city. The cause of this pollutionis the use of chemical fertilizers.
Natural balance is decreasing.
Who is responsible for this imbalance?
Think about it. Youwill find that humans create situations leading to the imbalanceof the nature.
"For example, you will be shocked to know thathuman cut more trees than he grows in nature."
This leads tothe decrease in the number of trees.
Humans also release harmful chemicals from factories in waterresources daily. This also pollutes water.
Every day factoriesand vehicles emit harmful gases in environment which increases pollution.
Note that man is responsible for increasingpollution.
Interdependence of Organisms
Think what is the basic cause of nature's imbalance?
Themaincause of nature's imbalance is the increasing population of humans.
"Let us understandMore population needs more grains to eat, more clothes to wearand more space to live."
Human cuts forests to produce moregrains establish more factories and build homes.
This causesimbalance in nature.
We need to control the continuous growthof populationto stop the imbalance in nature.
1.5 OPTIMUM OR BEST USE OFNATURAL RESOURCES
Using nature is good but exploiting nature is bad.
We musttake only those things from nature which is necessary for us.
"Generally, plants should be in that number where animals eatenplants"
and new grown plants are equal.
This also applies to bothherbivores and carnivores animals too.
"We get water from many sources like river,falls, ponds and rainor underground reserves. We use water forirrigation of plants."
Underground water means water availableafter digging the earth.
Have you ever thought that where does underground water comes from?
A part of rain water is absorbedby earth. Water collected under the earth is called undergroundwater.
If the rate of using this water is different from the rate of collection then underground water level will go down.
Asituation will come where we will not get a drop of water fromunderground.
"Think if there will be no water, will there be life?"
INTEXT QUESTIONS 1.3
1. Write the names of any 4 items which humans get fromjungle?
2. Give any one example of misuse of water from your dailylife?
3. What is the relation between underground water and rain?
4. Write about any one misuse of natural resources from yourneighbourhood?
"All the objects and events that are seen, heard of feltarecomponents of nature."
Whatever useful for humans is a resource.
All organisms are dependent on each other.
Human is destroying the balance of nature by cutting treesand by releasing toxins (poison) from factories etc.
Cutting of trees is harmful for humans and animals.
Animals and plants are dependent on each other.
1. Explain how plants are dependent on animals?
2. How flowering plants and insects get benefited fromeachother.
3. What is meant by natural balance?
What is the main causeof nature's imbalance?
4. Why jungles are becoming less?
What is our role in it?
5. Give any 4 measures to keep the balance of nature intact?
6. What is the utility of organisms for us?

USEFUL PRODUCTS FOR US
"Wherever you live whether city or village you have seen manyobjects around you,"
"many things like utensils, clothes, books,toys, chair, table, cycle, car, telephone etc are daily use items."
Ifthese things are not available then what will be our life?
All thesethings have become an important part of our life. We cannotimagine our life without them.
But these things are not availableto us at one go.
Although humans used to wear animal skin andeat raw fruits and vegetables. He used to live in caves. Now thelife has completely changed into a comfortable one. It tookthousands of years to happen.
"During this long journey humanlearnt to use the natural object from his surroundings. He alsodiscovered new objects,"
various types of metals are found inIndia from Vedic times.
"These range from agricultural equipments,construction tools or weapons. Many examples of using metalsand other objects can be seen."
Let us learn about the daily use of some elements in this lesson.
"After reading this lesson, you will be able to:"
Understand the need of aluminum and copper wires inelectricity;
Tell the reason for naming an age of human civilization asmetallic age;
Explain the process of colouring glasses and making types ofglasses;
Explain the reason for non-foaming of soap in hard water;
Describe the effect of polythene and
Importance of fertilizers and pesticides.
2.1 OUR NEEDS
Necessity is the mother of invention
"Food, shelter, clothing,transport and communication are our basic needs."
We need manyobjects to fulfill our need.
"For example, we use utensils to cook,store and serve food products."
"Utensils are made up of manyobjects- examples- metals, glass or clay (bone china) and now adays we use non-stick, plastic and products of other utensils."
"Ifwe discuss regarding clothes, we find many beautiful dressesmade up of cotton, woolen, silk, nylon, polyester etc."
"In the same way soil, brick, cement, wood, mortar, glass,aluminum and other materials are made to build houses."
Iron netand grill etc is used to make windows and doors.
"Maximum furniture is made up of woods but now a daysfurniture made up of plastic steel, can, iron etc."
"Many usefulitems like watch, pen, telephone, fridge, t.v., car etc are made upof many modern particles."
All these things were our need and wewere motivated to develop many kinds of objects from theseelements.
2.2 MINERALS
We have been using metals since ages.
"The use of metals hasbeen very important for human life that many civilizations havebeen named after metals like Iron Age, copper age etc."
Many objects are made up of many type of elements.
Have youever thought where these metals came from?
Some metals arefound naturally in mountains where as some are prepared byhumans in factories.
Minerals available in nature have been classified into twocategories- metallic and non-metallic.
We get metals from metallicminerals. These are also known as mineral ores.
"89 types ofminerals are found in India, out of which 11 are metallic, 52non-metallic, 4 fuel minerals and 22 other minerals."
Let us know about metal minerals.
Those minerals from whichmetals can be extracted easily are called metal ores.
"Some of the important minerals are iron, copper, aluminum,manganese and gold."
"In the same way, many non-metallic andminerals are also found in India,"
"these are mica, gypsum,limestone, dolomite and asbestos."
2.3 METALS AND NON-METALS
Now identify the things given in the figure 1.1 and classify whichare made up of metals and non-metals.
Some of these objects are made up of metals and some are madeup of other objects.
"For example, knife, spoon, nail-bolt, keylock etc are made up of metal"
"where as rope, shoes etc are madeup of plastic or leather"
and Chakla-belan by wood.
"Pots aremade up of mud,"
"bottle, glass, bucket etc can be made from plastic."
Let us know more about metals.
Properties of metals
Whatever we have said about metals is based on our dailyexperience and knowledge.
Many metal elements can beseparated from each other on the basis of physical qualities.
Thesephysical characteristics are used to identify metals.
(A) Physical Properties
1. metals are shiny and they have a special metal lustre.
"2. metals are hard but sodium, magnesium are exceptions, thesecan be cut easily by a knife."
3. metals can be made into thin sheet.
Aluminum polythene isused to wrap chocolates and medicines; it is also used to keepthe food fresh and warm.
4. Metals are ductile.
metal wires are good conductor of electricity.
Wires can bemade from aluminum and copper.
5. metals are good conductors of heat.
These are used in thecooking food utensils.
"6. metals are hard and strong, these are used to constructbuildings, trains, vehicles, instruments and bridge etc."
Non-metals are different from metals. They don't have physicalproperties of metals.
"Some examples of non-metals are- nitrogen, chlorine and oxygen gases, carbon, silicon etc."
let us know whatthe chemical properties of metals are.
(B) chemical properties
"Chemical properties of metals include reactions with air, waterand acid."
"Some metals like sodium potassium, aluminum, copper,iron etc are more reactive whereas gold, platinum etc are lessreactive."
"These metals are found in free form on earth. Therefore,they are less reactive."
"Due to reactive properties, oxide, sulphidesand carbonates etc are found in compound form."
"Other than pure metals, mixture of metals are also used."
Theseare known as alloy.
Let us get more knowledge related to it.
Alloy
Alloys are compounded and homogenous mixtures and areprepared by melting of metals.
Some properties of alloy aredifferent from metals.
For example- Brass is composed of copperand yon metals.
Tin is strong and corrosion resistant but copperis a soft metal.
"In the same way, iron gets rust easily."
"However,when mixed with carbon produces steel mixed metal."
"When iron,carbon, chromium and nickel mix together, then they formstainless steel."
"These mixed alloys are strong, tough and does notget rust. This form of metals are used in many ways."
some of thecommon alloy are-
Let us now learn about human made elements after metals andtheir uses which were discussed in the beginning of the lesson.
"This includes cement used for construction, glass, soap,detergents, polymer, fertilizers and pesticides."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 2.1
1. Aluminum is found as _____ ore.
2. _____ metal can be cut easily from knife.
3. Limestone is found in _____ and _____ states.
4. Write the names of any three maximum reactiove metals?
5. What is ductility?
2.4 MATERIALS USED IN CONSTRUCTION
"Construction of home, bridges, roads and dams use naturalstone wood, metals and bricks, lime, cement, concrete etc."
"Naturalstones like granite, marble and sand stone are also used."
"Thesematerials have been used in the construction of nagarjunsagar dam. Tajmahal, vridheshwar temple and Lal Qila ofDelhi."
"Indian sculpture is world famous for its monumentalheritage on stone and building vast temples,"
we have seen makingbig temples by joining pieces of stone without mortar in earliertimes
these stones are used now a days in homes and buildingsin cities.
these stones are used now a days in homes and buildingsin cities.
Earlier it was used to join stones and bricks.
Afterwards bitumenand lime began to be used.
"However, Portland cement wasinvented in the 19th century."
"Now cement is used in constructinghomes, buildings, bridges etc."
let us read about cement.
Cement
Portland cement was discovered by Joseph Espidy in 1824.
Hemixed limestone and loamy soil to make a powerful waterresistant material. The colour of this material looked like thelime stone of Portland.
"Therefore, the material was called Portlandcement."
"Modern Portland cement has 60-70% calcium oxide, 17- 25% silica, 3-8% aluminum oxide and up to 6% iron oxide;"
Limestone and loamy soil is mixed as per desired ratio.
This is heatedin a rotary kiln at the temperature of 1150 Kelvin.
The materialis called clinker.
"When powdered gypsum is mixed with thismaterial, cement is produced."
"The plastering material is prepared by mixing sand, cement andwater"
to hold brick and stones. It is also used for plastering.
"Concrete is formed by mixing sand, soil and water in cement."
"This is used in corners of road and middle pathways, roofs ofhomes and electricity poles etc."
2.5 SOAP AND DETERGENT
"Many soaps and detergents are available in the market for bathing, washing and cleaning."
They are made attractive by adding colorsand smell.
Soaps are prepared by the chemical reaction of fat of sodiumhydroxide with oils available in natural form.
Natural oils areobtained from fats of oily organisms and seeds from plants.
Someexamples of oils are - palm oil and olive oil.
Esters present inoils get decomposed by water with sodium hydroxide. We getacid present in aster with sodium salt and glycerol.
This way we find that sodium salt of acids are soaps.
When soaps are used in hard water then foam is not built.
"Ithappens because hard water has soluble calcium and magnesiumsalt, these react with soap to form non dissolve particles."
But this thing doesn't happen with detergents
they produce foamseven in hard water
because they do not form non dissolve particleswith calcium and magnesium salt.
Let us now understand how soap and detergents are a part ofcleaning process.
Many detergents are available in market now days. Some of themare biodegradable
but not all.
Bio degradable meansdecomposition can be done by micro organisms like bacteria andworms.
Those non biodegradable particles flow in rivers andother water resources and pollute them. This water is harmfulfor both water plants and water animals.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 2.2
1. What is the difference between soap and detergent?
2. How are detergents harmful for environment?
2.7 FERTILIZERS AND PESTICIDES
Fertilizers and pesticides are used largely to fulfill the food needsof the growing population of the world.
Let us first read aboutfertilizers.
Fertilizers
Fertilizers are used to increase the production capacity of theland.
They help plants in getting proper nutrition and high yield.
Fertilizers improve the following elements in plants.
1. Nitrogen - nitrogen is useful for development in pants andprotein synthesis.
This dissolves in water and reached plantsafter getting absorbed in roots by water.
2. Phosphorus - this is essential for development of roots ofplants.
We get it from phosphorous mountains.
3. Potassium - this element is important for the production offruits on plants.
This is used as potassium sulphate.
Watersoluble 'super phospate' and 'triple super phospate' etc areobtained by grinding mountains and its reaction with sulphuricacid.
Regular use of chemical fertilizers is harmful for nature.
Thisincreases pollution and affects the fertility of the soil.
It is alsoharmful for human health.
"This is the reason behind the increasinguse of fertilizers like compost, vermin compost etc."
Pesticides are those elements which stop the growth of unwantedplants and organisms.
These unwanted plants and organisms areharmful for both plants and humans.
Pesticides are of many kinds
and can be divided into many categories on the basis of how the bacterial growth is stopped bythem.
"These categories are - Bacteria pesticides, fungicide, weed cutting, insecticides andweed pesticides."
These pesticides protect humans and plants from many diseases
and benefit their health.
Pesticides have been used for centuries
"around 2000 years ago Arsenic andits compound were used as pesticides for the first time,"
they wereused till the mid of last century.
Some carbonic pesticides werediscovered during World War II. There were more effective thana carbonic pesticide like arsenic.
This can stop insect developmentfrom a small amount and they are less harmful from otherorganisms and plants.
You all must have hard about D.D.T.
this was invented in 1939.
It was used massively in Second World War
to stop the growthof mosquitoes responsible for spreading malaria.
They were soaffected by that that the use of D.D.T. increased day by day.
Slowly and gradually insects and mosquitoes became resistantto D.D.T. and they did not show any effect.
This was also saidthat D.D.T. remains in soil for many years and does not getdecomposed. It reaches food chain and is harmful for otherorganisms and humans.
After this information some countries banned D.D.T.
Chemical elements are chemical products and should be usedvery less because they pollute our environment.
We must useour resources judiciously and lessen our needs to save pollutionin environment.
Many biological organic pesticides like til oil isused in present time.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 2.3
1. Why are pesticides and fertilizers used?
2. What does plant get from fertilizers?
3. Give two examples of pesticides?
Our needs have motivated us to use available natural resourcesand making new products.
Metals are found in minerals and have special physical andchemical properties.
Alloy has different properties from metals and has betterproperties than metals.
Many fertilizers and pesticides are use to get better yield.
"However, they should be used in a balanced way."
1. Name the ore of iron?
2. Which metal constitute brass?
3. Name three physical properties of metals?
4. How do we get concrete?
5. How is D.D.T. harmful?
2.1-- 1.bauxite
2. Sodium.
"3. MP, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat (any two locations)"
"4. Sodium, Potassium, Aluminum, Copper, Iron ( any three)"
5. Making wires from metals is called ductility.
2.2-- 1. Soap does not give foam in hard water where as detergentgives foam in hard water.
"2.Some detergents cannot be biodegrades. Therefore, theypollute nature."
"2.3-- 1. Fertilizers are used to increase the crop yield where aspesticides are used to stop the growth of insects and weedsthat harm the crop,"
"2. Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium etc."
"3. D.D.T., B.H.C., Pararthylone, Methylone etc (any two)"
ORGANISM DEVELOPMENT
We have seen many changes around us.
Many changes can beseen with visible eye and we can feel them.
There are somechanges that we cannot see easily with our eyes .
These changes brought about the development of organisms.
Manyspecies of organisms are born on earth.
"These changes take along time than a human life to be seen. Therefore, humans cannotsee the sequence of development of these changes."
But scientistshave collected many proofs and facts to prove these changes.
Many types of organisms and their species (some of them arealive) and some of them have evolved through organicdevelopment.
"Close your eyes and think about many living objects. Manyorganisms will come in front of you. Some of the commonelements will be plants, animals and birds."
Do you know thatbacteria converts milk into curd or cause diseases like T.B. arealso living organisms.
Even eatable mushroom is also an example.
Scientists have estimated that around 1 crore species or organismsare developed on earth.
Scientists have the knowledge of around 20 lakh organisms.
All these organisms living together and forma balance.
The balance of all these organisms is called biodiversity.
"Due to the growth of biological development, biologicaldiversity is found on earth."
We will study the process of development of life on earth in thislesson.
After reading this lesson you will be able to:
Tell about the time and the process of earth formation
Tell about the time of earth's development and the presentposition of atmosphere ;
Tell how dinosaur type organisms got extinct ;
Tell the sequence of human development
3.1 DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE
Development means change.
Development is the changes fromwhich new species of organisms are developed.
New speciestake time to develop.
The situations of earth are constantlychanging. These changes are necessary with the situations.
"Therefore, it is necessary to adapt with these changes."
The specieswhich are unable to coordinate with these changes die
"and getextinct, for example - dinosaur. All new species originate fromtheir predecessors."
Charles Darwin (1809-1822) was a great scientist.
He collectedmany logics and said two important things for development.
1. All the specie organisms originate from the developmentprocess.
2. All the process of biological development is called naturalselection of spices.
This means that all natural organisms choose and reproduce suchorganisms that are adaptable to environment.
"This explains that when environmental situations changethen the original generation makes new species,"
"this is the reasonwhen with time many new species originate,"
"this includes manytype of organisms like bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plants, animalsand humans,"
"these species have many common things, likebreathe in one way or another doing activities like getting nutritionetc."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 3.1
1. Name the scientist who is called the 'father of biologicaldevelopment' ?
2. Name any two common process which are essential to livefor every organism?
3.2 DEVELOPMENT OF ONE LIVING CELLORGANISM TO MULTI CELL ORGANISM
You have seen that the physical conditions of earth are changingand this has lead to many developmental changes in organisms.
Now we will study how situations change on earth and who wasthe first being that evolved.
There were many changes in thedevelopment process which has lead to the development of manyspecies and organisms.
The process of development for biologicalprocess is considered to be natural selection.
"You will be surprised to know that earth was not there before 5billion years,"
slowly- slowly natural changes came into placeand earth became around 4-5 billion years ago.
You will also besurprised to know that Indian Vedic scriptures also believe thedevelopment of earth by that time.
There are many stages ofdevelopment which are given below.
"First stage: there was no water on earth,"
clouds only thundered.
"However, slowly temperature declines, started raining and waterwas collected on earth."
There was no organism till date.
Second stage: first of all very small micro organisms evolved inwater.
These are the predecessors of every organism now days.
"There one branch of bacteria is also seen today,"
there was noopen oxygen in atmosphere in this stage.
Third stage: single cell organisms went through many changesand the process of photo synthesis became possible.
Oxygenincreased in atmosphere. Many kinds of organisms took birth.
After micro organisms Algae came into existence which isfound in ponds and single cell protozoa were also born.
"Dueto development of changes in single cell predecessor, manysingle cell organisms like fungi, plants and humans were alsodeveloped."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 3.2
1. Who were the first organisms to evolve?
2. A group of organisms is given below.
Write them in ascendingorder of their development:
"Plants, fungi, animals, bacteria, algae and protozoa"
3. Name the life giving gas which was not present in atmospherein early days?
4. Who evolved first- plants or animal
3.3 DINOSAURS AND THEIR EXTINCTION
"Changes in development process are not seen in common,"
but many facts suggest that organisms have evolved fromdevelopment.
Fossils are also such facts.
Fossils are theremains of those organisms which were present on earthbefore.
These are found after digging mountains or stones. Thebodies of many organisms take the shape of stone after a timeperiod.
Many huge dinosaurs used to live on earth around 15 crore yearsago.
There was no bird or mammals on earth at that time.
Many fossils of dinosaurs have been found after digging of earth.
They belong to reptiles group of animals.
"Now a days lizard,snakes, tortoise and crocodile come in this category."
A figure is given below;
you can imagine the big body ofdinosaurs from this picture.
"There were many species of dinosaurs,"
"some use to live in water, some could fly in air andsome could walk on land."
Dinosaurs used to rile earth 230lakh year ago to 65 lakh years ago.
You could see themeverywhere at that time.
Some used to eat plants and some werecarnivores.
A big lizard is found in Comodo Island in Pacific Ocean andrepresents dinosaur.
It is called Commodo Dragon.
"Dinosaurs were living a happy life on earth at that time,"
slowlythe environment on earth changed.
Some scientists believe thatdue to spreading of a specific radiation all dinosaurs dies andgot extinct.
Dinosaur is a good example to learn aboutdevelopment.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 3.3
1. Name any two animals which are found now days and belongto dinosaur category of animals?
2. What are fossils?
3. Write one cause for the extinction of dinosaurs?
3.4 DEVELOPMENT IS STILL GOING
Humans evolved on earth around 20 lakh years back.
Humanshave many ancient features
but it is most complex and high levelof development that took place
because of maximumdevelopment of human mind.
"Human body is going throughchange but these changes are very micro,"
human development isgoing and still is going.
Humans are considered similar to ape (like chimpanzee).
Every organism of the earth is going through changes.
"Forexample, India suffered form malaria in the decade of 1950."
The species of mosquito spreading malaria was destroyed byD.D.T.
but soon it was known that many mosquitoes could notdie in presence of D.D.T.
They had undergone natural selectionand the number of such resistant mosquitoes increased fromgeneration to generation.
Development not only means makingnew species but also the development of new symptoms in anyspecies.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 3.4
1. Is development still happening in the world?
2. Our country had controlled malaria completely but why it ishappening again now?
3. What do you mean by development?
Biological diversity is the result of developmental changewhich leads to the evolvement of new species.
There are many development changes which cannot be seenbut many can prove it.
Fossil is an example.
Development changes happen because of the situations onearth and some organisms could not face these changes. Theydie or get extinct
where in some organisms adapt to changessituation and can live.
Charles Darwin (1809-1822) believes that all organisms gavea common development.
He gave natural selection for thedevelopment process.
Earth evolved before 4 to 5 billion years ago. The situationson earth were not according to life at that time.
Soon Earth's atmosphere had Oxygen.
Single cell organisms like protozoa came.
"Multi cell fungi, plants and organisms evolved one after theother."
The structure of organism was simple in beginning but becamecomplex later on.
Many species of dinosaurs were present on earth at a time.
Humans developed at the last stage of development familyof organisms.
"Nature is developing regularly, D.D.T resistant mosquitoesis a good example of this."
1. What do you mean by development?
Why changes happenbecause of development ?
2. Give two contributions of Charles Darwin related todevelopment?
3. To which group of animals dinosaur belong?
Give twoexamples of the group?
4. Why we cannot use D.D.T. to kill mosquitoes?
3.1-- 1. Charles Darwin
2.(1) breathing; (2) nutrition
3.2-- 1. Bacteria
"2. Bacteria, Protozoa, fungi, Algae, plants and animals"
3. Oxygen
4. plants
"3.3-- 1. Lizard, snake"
2. Fossils are the remains that are found after diggingmountains. Dead bodies of some animals become fossilsafter some time on earth.
3. Dinosaurs extinct after changes on earth.
"3.4-- 1. Yes, now a days"
"2. Mosquitoes became resistant to D.D.T. therefore, thishappened."
"2. Mosquitoes became resistant to D.D.T. therefore, thishappened."
LIVING WORLD ANDDIVERSITY
Look around you.
"You will find many things like table, chair,toys, mobile, TV etc."
"when you will see walls and rooms, youwill find mosquitoes, flies, lizard and cockroach."
"If you lookoutside your house, you will find birds, animals, cow, buffalo,cat, dogs etc moving"
"and different plants in statue mode likeneem, jamun, aam, amrood or grass grown on land or wheat-mustard in farm."
"If you look in sky, you will find birds, airplanesetc."
if you make a list of things then things will be a long list.
"All these objects can be classified into three categories- living,non-living and dead."
You will be surprised to know that plantsare loving beings.
It is also an honour that this was told to theworld by an Indian scientist Sh. Jagdish Chandra Bose.
IndianVedic scriptures have always considered plants as a living beingand have always tried to protect it.
"Table- chair components likewood, bines or horns etc separates form animals are dead becausethey were a part of living body once and mirror, soil, water, stone, iron, nail etc are non-living things, they never had any life"
let usknow the difference between living and non-living.
How arelining things different from non-loving things?
How are livingthings similar to non-living things.
Let us know about them.
"After learning this chapter, you will be able to:"
Tell the difference between living and non-living objects.
Explain the characteristics of living things
Describe the breathing process and food production for living organisms
Explain the importance of living and non-living things
4.1 LIVING OBJECTS AND THEIRCHARACTISTICS
Sometimes you can find the living and non living things bytouching.
But can you tell the characteristics of living and non-living things that make a difference.
Let us see on what basis anobject is considered live.
"Basically, there are 9 characteristics ofliving things:"
(1) Growth (development of body)
(2) Cellular body structure
(3) Dynamics
(4) Nutrition
(5) Breathing
(6) Excretion; taking out wastes
(7) Reaction
(8) Reproduction
(9) A fixed life and death
Let us learn something about them.
1. Growth in living organisms
Every living organism is small at the time of birth.
It growseventually.
A small calf becomes an ox.
"Mango seed gives birthto a small plant which becomes a tree,"
you yourself were a smallkid
now you are getting developed
and will develop till youbecome a man or woman.
"This development increases your bones,muscles and blood quantity."
"Non living things don't do these activities,"
they do not breatheand do not make new things.
After getting full development of the body some growth maintainsbody parts.
"If you get a cut then new skin comes and fills thewound,"
nails also increase. This is also a growth.
"Have you ever seen any growth un cycle, glass or pencil?"
"No,because all these things are non-living things."
2. Living things are made up of cell
Every living being or plant and their body are made up ofmicroorganism cell.
These are so small that they can only beseen with the help of microscope.
Every cell has a livingstructrure; many activities are done in this living structure.
"Mostof the growth in living objects is due to the increase in the numberif cells,"
new cells are formed with the help of old cells.
"You must be thinking that new cells make a human being asbricks join to form the wall, but brick is a part of wall."
One brickcannot make another brick.
Brick is a non living thing where ascell is a living being.
Let us know important things about cell:
Every living organism has a different cell.
"Some organism aremade up of one cell like bacteria, amoeba etc,"
these are knownas single cell animals.
Many other organisms are made up of multi cells
"like flies, humans, elephant, horse etc."
These are known asmulti cell organisms.
The big the organism - the more cells
"cat has more cells thanmouse, cow has more cell than cats and elephants have morecell than cows."
Banana plant has more cell than rose plants or guava trees.
Banyan tree has more cells than banana plants.
3. Dynamism
Every microorganism moves.
"Everyone has his own pace forwalking like horse, cow insects, birds etc."
we can move manyparts of our body.
"Plants also have mobility,"
"they move whilestanding at one place,"
sunflower moves in the direction of thesun.
Leaves move towards light.
Roots move towards water.
Allthese movements are from inside of the organism. Thesemovements are not outside the body.
Leaves of some trees getclose in the night and open during the day.
Sensitive plants getdown when touched and becomes straight after some time.
Can a cycle move on its own?
Watches move by cell or settingfriction. They do not move by their own.
Power to move is given to them fromoutside.
4. Food is needed by living organisms
Every organism needs food.
"If you are kept hungry for sometime, you will feel weakness."
"Whatever food you eat gives yougrowth. This growth is seen in bones, muscles or blood in yourbody."
"If an organism does not get food for a longer period oftime, he will become weak and die soon."
Plants make their ownfood.
Some animals eat the plants or parts of plants. Some animalsare carnivores -
they eat those animals who become big aftereating plants.
Have you ever thought what the food of green plants is?
"Theymake their food from soil, water and carbon dioxide in presenceof air and sunlight,"
"if any one thins is missing, they die."
Does your cycle or book need food?
"No, they don't have growthand they don't have power to move."
5. Breathing in living things (energy generation by the use ofoxygen)
We breathe (inhale or exhale) from day to night.
Maximumorganism inhale air and exhale it.
Animals living in water likefish keeps inhaling water and exhaling it.
"They absorb oxygenmixed in water,"
this oxygen in form of air or water is used by cellas a powerful energy building.
They do their own work fromless energy.
During this time carbon dioxide is formed in bodyand is exhaled by cells.
Breathing activities are similar in plants and organisms.
Plants take oxygen inside with the help of smallpores in their leaves and stem.
"In this way, human take oxygeninside breathing practices and exhale carbon dioxide."
6. Excretion (taking out wastes by living organisms)
The body of living organisms makes water products due to theresult of physical activities which are toxic. It is essential to takethem out from human body.
The urine of organisms also haswaste products other than water.
Some of the toxic elements thatcome out of body are sweating.
"Some examples of excretion aregums firm plants, falling and drying of old leaves from plantsetc."
"Non living things like table, chairs etc neither breather nor giveout any excrete materials."
7. Reaction by living objects
"Whenever your hand touches a fork or unknowingly you touch ahot utensil, then you instantly take your hand back."
Any situationrelated to pricking or touching hot objects by which a body reactsis called stimulation
and the action to that stimulate is calledreaction.
Many situation of same kind happens in every livingorganism.
Many situation of same kind happens in every livingorganism.
"Stimulation always happens againsttemperature, light, sound, touch and chemicals."
"Think about one thing, some time you smell tasty food andwater comes in your mouth,"
will you call it a reaction orstimulation?
8. Reproduction or giving birth to a child
Every living organism gives birth to a new generation or child.
Cow gives birth to calf.
Birds lay eggs by which their childrencome out.
"Frog and fish also lay eggs,"
if any specie does notreproduce then that species comes to an end.
Seeds grow fromplants and these seeds make new plants from roots or branches.
Simplest single cell organism like bacteria or amoeba alsoreproduces from one method or the another.
Does any non living thing make an object same to itself?
"No,"
abrick cannot make a second brick.
If you break a brick frombetween then there will be two small bricks but they cannotincrease to get normal size.
It is the same way that a cycle cannot make another cycle
and a chair cannot give birth to another chairetc.
9. There is a fixed life of the living organisms.
"Every living thing is born and it grows in size and gets old incompleting the activities of life, it dies afterwards."
"Differentorganisms have different life expectancy,"
some have less life andsome have big life.
Here we present some of the examples of lifetenure:
Bacteria - around 20 minutes
Mouse - around 2-3 years
Dog - around 12-14 years
Human - around 70-80 years
Banyan tree - around 200 years
Tortoise - around 400 years
Sequoya tree - around 3000-4000 years
"There is no life expectancy of non-living things,"
"for example, aglass can live forever or can break any minute."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 4.1
Read the following statement and state whether they are true orfalse:
1. Organisms increase their size throughout their life.
2. Every living organism is made up of multi cells.
3. The process by which living organism gets food is callednutrition.
4. Green plants make their own food.
5. Sunflower keeps changing the direction according to thedirection of sun.
6. Water and energy is produced during breathing.
7. Every living object reacts towards stimulants.
8. Every living object has a fixed life and they die afterwards.
4.2 DIVERSITY OF LIVEING ORGANISMS
There are thousand and lakhs of living organism on earth.
Theyare from big to small and micro small in size.
"Their colour andformation is different too,"
some give children and some lay eggs.
"Some organism like amoeba or bacteria reproduces by divinginto two parts,"
some fly in the air and some jump from one treeto another tree.
Some crawl deep in ocean. Some animals crawlin desert
and some other organisms move inside other organismsbody.
We see the diversity in animals.
4.3 CLASSIFICATIONS OF LIVINGORGANISMS
Living organisms are very much found in population. They havedifferent colours and form. It has been categorized into manycategories on the basis of similarities.
Basically living organisms are categorized into two categories -plants and organisms.
Let us know more about them.
1. Plants are fixed in land and have the leaves of green or anothercolours.
2. Organisms can move from one place to another and eat otherorganisms or plants.
"3. The third category belongs to those who are not green colourplants and not moving organism,"
one of the example is whitecoloured fungi which loves on food items or mushroom grownfor food or dirty place grown mushroom.
4. The fourth category is of micro organism which have onecell body
"like algae, green coloured thread like structure in apond or amoeba living in dirty water."
5. Fifth category has a single cell bacteria or micro organism.Lakhs of bacteria can live in a needle's tip.
"Organism are being classified from old times,"
this classificationwas started by Carl Linius in 1735 in modern science.
Butnow days these are classified into five types with some changes.
They have been placed from simple to complex in the followingmanner -
"1. Monera kingdom- bacteria, virus etc."
"2. Protista Kingdom- Algae, Amoeba, etc."
"3. Fungi - Fungi kingdom -fungus, mushroom etc."
"4. Plantae Kingdom- plant kingdom - all plants likeneem, mango, rose, marigold etc."
"5. Animalia kingdom - allorganism like dog, monkey, cat,lice, bird, humans etc."

STRUCTURE OF LIVINGWORLD
Many kinds of organisms are found around us.
Living objectsare different from non-living objects.
"A big difference is foundin the shape, size and living place of living organisms."
Thesedifferences become the basis of their division or categories.
Wehave read about them in previous lesson.
You know some organisms are very small and they cannotbe seen with naked eye.
Some of the organisms are big likeelephant and whale which are seen from a distance.
Someorganisms are helpful for us and they give useful product too.
There are many other organisms which harm us.
Therefore toknow the basic structure of these organisms is beneficial to us.
Let us try to know more about them.
After reading this lesson you will be able to:
Tell the names of most simple and smaller organism onearth
"Describe the similarities found in plants, humans and theirorgans"
Explain the breathing process and nutrition system of plants
Explain the various types of plants and parts of flowers withtheir importance
5.1 BACTERIA-SMALLEST ORGANISMS
Bacteria are the simplest and smallest organisms found on earth.
"They are found in almost every place like air, water, soil andeven inside our body."
Their body is made up of single cell
andsize is from 0.2 to 100 microns (1 micron = 1/1000 millimeter).
The central element is not covered by any membrane in the cellsof bacteria.
There is a cell wall or membrane outside the cell.
Bacteria are mostly divided into three shapes-
1. long shape bacteria
2. circular
3. serpentine (lymph) bacteria - curvy like snakes
Bacteria have their own importance.
Some bacteria are helpfuland some are harmful.
Benefits and disadvantages of bacteria
(a) Benefits from bacteria
1. Decomposition of dead - many organisms die every day.
Theydecompose dead bodies and leave in nature.
Thisdecomposition is reused by plants.
2. Manure making in soil - bacteria found in soil from chemicalslike ammonia and nitrate which are useful for plants.
"3. Merge with plants - some bacteria merge with plants to changenitrogen to nitrate and give natural manure to the plants. Somespecial plants are - peas, pulses, beans etc."
"4. Cleaning water - some bacteria clean water by decomposingdust, dirt and flowing waste in water."
"5. Source of digestion - some bacteria live in the food pipe ofcows, goats, flies or some insects etc. they help in the digestionof cellulose (a part of the eaten plant)."
6. Food industries- some bacteria are used in food industries toform some of the food items
like lactobacillus which help inthe preparation of curd from milk.
Vinegar is also preparedby the activities of bacteria.
7. Sources of medicines - many antibiotic medicines increasethe immunity power in body. Immunity power helps infighting the diseases. Some medicines are prepared by variousbacteria.
Some vitamins and hormones are prepared with thehelp of bacteria.
(b) Harmful bacteria
1. cause of many diseases - many bacteria cause diseases
"liketuberculosis, dysentery, tetanus, whooping cough etc."
2. Destroys food - any food items are destroyed by bacteria.
"For example - milk,"
"fruits, vegetables etc get rotten bybacteria."
5.2 ALGAE LOOK LIKE PLANTS BUTARE NOT PLANTS
Algae are simple organism which looks like plants.
They have acell membrane and chlorophyll.
They can be single cell or multicell.
"They don't have stem or leaves,"
these are mostly found inwater or wet places.
Algae make a green surface on wet landwhich is slippery.
Green -green thread like organisms swim onthe surface of the pond are also a type of algae.
Algae are a microscopic organism which ranges from single cell to manymeter long cells. Even ocean algae is also a type of algae
someplaces have red algae too.
Algae- useful and harmful
Useful:
1. Some algae are the food of the fishes and water organisms.
2. Some special algae are used to increase the thickness of somespecial ice creams and jelly.
3. Algae makes food by photosynthesis ad gives our oxygen innature
which is inhaled by other organisms.
4. Some algae are used in industries.
5. These are also used as manures.
Harmful:
1. Some algae which grow in ponds are harmful for otherorganisms.
2. Algae born in water tanks make water unsuitable fordrinking.
5.3 PROTOZOA (ORGANISMS LIKE AMOEBA)
Protozoa is a single cell organism
which has specific characteristicfor organisms.
These can move from one place to another.
They can catch their food and eat it.
Amoeba is an exampleof protozoa.
This is found on pond water or in dirty water.
This organism can expand its cell is calledPseudopodia.This organism can move from one place to another.
This helps them in catching their food.
There are 1000 speciesof protozoa.
Some protozoa bore diseases
like parasites ofmalaria which causes disease in our red blood cells after reachingthem.
Fungus (fungi like organisms)
Fungi look like plants but they don'thave chlorophyll.
Two types ofcommon fungi are fungi found onbread or fruits and fungi foundon mushrooms or dirty and moistplaces.
Fungi cannot make their ownfood
but they absorb the juice of therotten things where they are born.
These are single cell organisms (example- feast) and multi-cell(example-mushroom)
"and basically grow in dark, lukewarm andwet place."
Most of the fungi are harmful but some mushrooms make tastyfood.
Useful and harmful:
Useful
1. Some fungi is uses to make food and liquid objects.
Yeastmakes bread.
"Khammer is used to make idli, dosa etc."
2. Some mushrooms are eaten
but most of the mushrooms arepoisonous.
3. Some of the fungi are used to make penicillin or vitamin b.
4. Fungi decompose dead plants and elements in nature. Theyhelp in the circle of elements.
Harmful
1. Some fungi give disease like irritation or rings.
2. Some fungi harm wheat or barley.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 5.1
1. Algae are plant like organisms and they have ___and ____ in cell with difference of cells in organism.
2. _______ are found in stopped dirty water is the smallestprotozoa.
3. Amoeba moves with structures called _____.
4. Most of the fungi are poisonous
but ____ named fungi is eatable.
5.4 PLANTS
Look around you. You will find three types of plants
"1. Grass - grass and grass related plants are mostly seasonal likecarrot, radish etc.,"
"2. Shrubs - some plants stem come out as branchon earth and live for many years Like rose, hibiscus etc.,"
3. tree- a thick and long bark of wood which has many branches
"likeneem, mango, banyan etc."
There are two important organ system of every plant
- root systemand shoot system.
Let us know about the parts of plant.
"Forexample, we take mustard plant."
The basic structure of very plantis almost the same;
"the difference will be of colour, form, shapeof leaves, colour of flowers and shapes of fruits etc."
If there have been no green plants then humans and animalscannot live.
Plants make their own food with sunlight.
Let us see the tip to root part with the help of a mustard plant.
Parts of plant
1. Root system- this is the part below the land.
2. Primary root - comparatively the thicker part in the mid of theplant.
3. Secondary roots - these are numerous thin roots coming outof primary root.
They absorb water and mineral salts fromsoil to the plants.
(a) Root system
"Seeds are sown in soil. First of all, parts related to roots comeout in plants."
The primary roots provide water and mineral toplants.
They are divided into two parts.
There are four main characteristics of roots:
1. Roots always grow below the soil
2. They always move towards water.
3. Roots always move away from the light.
4. Roots don't have green colour.
There are two important works of roots:
1. Fixing plant - they make plant stable and straight on land.
2. absorb - they absorb water and mineral salt from soil andprovide nutrition to plants.
Roots do many other works in special plants
"- they store food insome plants like carrot, radish, turnip, beetroot, sweet potatoetc."
some new plants also grow from the roots of other plants.Example - dahlia.
(b) shoot system - part of the plant above the soil
1. stem - it is that part of plant which is above the soil.
"2. Stamen - this is the part of plant above the soil havingbranches, leaves, fruits and flowers."
3. bark/trunk: the middle part between two stamens.
4. leaves: these are thin and sharp mostly green coloured partfrom where plants prepare their own food.
5. flower: part of plant which is most colourful.
6. fruit: this part is developed in fruit
and many new plants growfrom there.
Let us know more about these
stem or trunk.
Part of the plant above soil is called stem or trunk.
This is themost important part of shoot system
"with stamen, buds, leavesetc."
Most of smaller parts have soft and green stem
which moveeasily.
Shrubs and trees have stem or trunk method made up oftough and hard wood.
The outer surface of wooden stem hasbark.
Functions of stem:
"1. Gives support: trunk supports branches, leaves, fruits andflowers."
2. Carrying- they carry absorbed water and mineral salts to leaves.
3. Storage of food- they transport food prepared by leaves to thestem or trunk of the plants.
"4. Some of the plants transform, their bud into long green leaveslike structure, thework of these leaves like structure is to dothe work of photosynthesis. Example- nagfni, cactus etc."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 5.2
A) State whether the following statements are true or false:
1. Stamen is that part of stem from where leaves fall out.
2. Primary roots are developed from seedlings or seeds.
3. Turnip is a transformed trunk.
4. Green stems like nagfani's stem can prepares their foodusing stems.
b. leaves
Leaves are green colored thin and long structure from stem.
Thispart of plant has different shapes.
Leaves make food for plants.This process is called photosynthesis.
Functions of leaves
1. Light (mostly sunlight) is required by the plants with carbondioxide and water to prepare their own food.
2. Extra water on leaves depict the water inside the plants whichget out in form of steam and small holes (stomata) in leaves.
3. Plants take oxygen present in the air inside with the help ofleaves.
c. flower
Flower are also present in the stem of the plant.
Flowers are thereproductive organ of plants.
Functions of flower
1. Reproduction - the main function of flower in nature isreproduction.
Fruit is made inside the flower seeds. Seeds arealso built in flowers from where new plant grows.
2. Smell and beauty: flowers are beautiful and have a good smell.They also take part in reproduction.
They attract insects andbirds to sit on;
they suck juice from flowers and pollenstick to their bodies.
The pollen grains falls in other flowerswhen they go and sit on them.
This leads to the starting offruit from flowers.
Importance of flowers for humans
1. Fruits are made from flowers which we eat.
2. flowers look beautiful in garden and at homes
3. People give each other flowers as a mark of respect. Example- gajra or garland.
Flowers are also used in prayer for godsand goddesses.
4. Bees make honey from flowers which we eat.
5. Scent is also prepared from flowers.
6. Clove is a flower which is used as spices and medicine.
Parts of flowers
A common flower when cut from between can be seen like this:
1. Bud - that part on which flowers are kept.
2. Anther - that part of bud which is open and has petals on it.
3. Sepal - there are commonly green coloured leaves which makethe outer part of the flower.
The main function of sepal is toprotect flower in bud stage.
"4. Petals - there are basically shining, colorful and open flower. This is the mostly seen upper part of the flower."
The mainfunction of this part is to attract insects on flowers.
"5. Stamen - these are thread like long parts which has flowerlike structure,"
this is the male part of the flower.
6. Pistil - this part is in the centre of the flower and is thereproductive part of the flower.
d. fruit
Fruits are made from flowers.
"Mango, jamun or java plum,pomegranate, strawberry etc are fruits"
"and tomatoes, cucumberetc are included in vegetables are also fruits;"
there is a seed presentinside the fruit.
For example - mango and tomato has more thanone seed.
Parts of fruit
To learn more about the structure and parts of fruit we take mangoas an example.
There are two main parts of fruit:
1. The centre part is a tight seed in the fruit.
2. Outside the thick art of the fruit has been divided in manysuch categories
"like upper peel, seed plum, and the part relatedto internal seed."
Groundnut is also a type of fruit and its upper part is completelydry.
Functions of fruit
1. protects the seed - fruit protects the seeds from wear -tear
"andalso from adverse seasons like dryness summer, winter etc."
"2. Attract organisms or scattering of seeds - seeds are eatableand tasty. Due to this reason buds, animals and organismsmove from tree to tree."
"Wherever they eat, they scatter theseed and this helps in growing up of plants at different places."

"Algae is a green colored single cell organism found in water,it has a cell membrane and chlorophyll."
It is a single cellorganism.
Fungi are common chlorophyll microscopic organisms. Somefungi are big also.
Plant has a root and shoots system.
Roots always grow below the soil.
"Roots are of two types -joint roots and fiber roots,"
"The function of roots is to keep plant stable,"
absorb waterand minerals from soil
and providing food to the upper stemand branch etc.
Roots of some plants store food and roots ofsome plants also make new plants.
Stem has anther and stamen..
There are leaves in anther.
Leaves make food for the plants with the process ofphotosynthesis.
"Flowers are the reproductive parts of fruits,"
"the main parts offlowers (from outside to inside are ) bud, petals, stamen andpistil."
Petals give protection to bud.
They attract insect etc becauseof their colour. Stamen produces pollen which moves to pistilto make fruit.
Fruit provides protection to seeds.
Fruits can be dry like groundnut or fiber like mango. Theseare the two types of fruits.

FUNCTION SYSTEM OF PLANT
"You have already read about the body. We will learn about plants, its various parts, structure and functions."
Now we will learn aboutsome of the special activities of the plants in detail in this lesson.
All the organisms of the world are a kind dependent onphotosynthesis.
Plants can make their food directly
and otherorganisms eat these plants directly or indirectly to get energy.
"Besides, oxygen is given out during the process of photosynthesiswhich is used by all organisms for breathing."
Plants also breathe.
They also take out waste material or elementsfor themselves.
The most important objective of plants is to spreador expand its species and therefore it reproduces.
We will alsolearn how plants reproduce in this lesson.
"After learning this chapter, you will be able to:"
""
Explain the process of respiration in plants ;
Describe the importance of excretion in plants ;
Tell the process of absorbing water and minerals in plants and
Explain the reproduction system in plants.
6.1 WHAT IS NUTRITION
Nutrition is the process in which an organism (even if it is aplant or organism) intakes food and makes it to be used by thebody and then use it
Why should living organisms take food?
1. To make new body element for development and growth
2. To maintain the wear and tear of damaged cells
3. To make the power to fight diseases
4. To provide energy for the body
5. To make many types of enzymes and hormones for thebody
6.2 PHOTOSYNTHESIS (FOOD PRODUCTION)IN PLANTS
Photosynthesis or the process of making food in presence ofsunlight
is only found in green plants.
"These plants make theirfood with the help of chlorophyll, sunlight and carbon dioxidepresent in air. They also prepare glucose by absorbing water fromthe soil."
Sunlight or light can be used from many sources as well.
"But mostly in open nature, farming or forest , the light of the sunis present is sunlight which is used in photosynthesis."
You must be thinking that can there be photosynthesis is moon light?
"No, it is very slow light and there is no sufficient energyavailable."
Two main products- glucose is formed from food and oxygen -life giving gas are produced in photosynthesis.
These are thedual benefits.
Plants get food for themselves and plants alsomake food for other organisms
and secondly oxygen which isessential for all organisms is also produced.
Food is made by leaves but how does it reaches to other partsof the plants?
You have seen that leaves have veins which reach their smallbranches and every cell.
These veins absorb water through stemand to leaves.
Glucose made in the cell of leaves reach stem andother parts of plant through these veins.
It spreads to whole plantfrom top to bottom.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 6.1
Fill in the blanks with appropriate word:
1. Green plants make their own food with the processof ___________.
2. _______ gas is produced in atmosphere in the process ofphotosynthesis.
3. Green plants use ____ gas to make their food.
6.3 RESPIRATION
Plants do breathe in the same way as other organisms.
"They getenergy to do many activities in their body,"
for example - energyis required to make starch out of glucose.
Micro holes (stomata)present in leaves take oxygen inside and give carbon dioxideoutside;
this oxygen is used for respiration in the day. The oxygenis given out the process of photosynthesis;
"breathing is a chemicalprocess which uses cells, leaves, stem, roots etc in every plant."
These micro holes take oxygen inside one cell to another andtake it to all the sides.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 6.2
Fill in the blanks with appropriate words:
"1. Energy is produced in body like plants, _______ andhuman beings."
2. Leaves in plants take oxygen inside by ____.
6.4 EVAPORATION (WATER FROM PLANTSIN FORM OF VAPORS)
Roots of plants take a lot of water inside them.
This water movesto the top to bottom of the leaves being used as water and sourceof mineral salts for photosynthesis.
"This water stream moves ina regular way, therefore, most of the water becomes vapour whichgoes out through leaves."
This process called evaporation.
Around2% of the absorbed water in root is used in the process ofphotosynthesis.
Importance of photosynthesis
1. Making environment cool - conversion of water into vaporsgives coolness. Plants evaporate more in heat and summer.
"Therefore, more water is required in the plants in summerotherwise plants get dried out."
2. Distribution of water - leaves are the end point of plant.Therefore water is required to reach every part of plants. Inthis way water is used as water when required by plant andits parts.
3. Distribution of minerals - when we move roots to the top levelof pants then minerals are absorbed by them.
When leaves doevaporation then the element inside them becomes thick
and pulls more minerals from bottom.
"Therefore, all the nutrientsreach from one cell to another from top to bottom."
4. Removing excess of water - the process of evaporationvapourise the extra water present inside the plant.
6.5 ABSORPTION OF WATER ANDMINERAL SALTS BY PLANTS
"Plants which are grown in soil, absorb water and mineral saltsfrom soil and roots,"
plants need water due to many reasons.
Forexample -
"1. Every part of plant has some portion of water,"
2. Leaves get out of stem straight die to required amount of waterotherwise they will become loose and fall down.
3. Water serves as a raw material in the process of food makingor photosynthesis.
4. Evaporation of water in summer keeps plants cool in hotweather.
Need of mineral salts in plants
Plants require mineral salts in the same way as they require water.
"Some of the important minerals required by plants are calcium,potassium, nitrate, phosphate etc."
These are used in the structureof the plants.
Various minerals are also absorbed by the soil.
Absorbing water
Plants absorb water through roots.
Mineral salts too are absorbed by roots
and plant which move towards upper part of plant with water.
"These minerals with water reach the central part of stem calledxylem and is transported to upper branches and leaves,"
"mineralssalts and absorbs water moving up is called rasrohan , sucking ."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 6.3
Choose the correct option to fill in the blanks:
11. Evaporation in plants is done by ____. (roots/leaves)
2. Vaporization of _____ is called evaporation. (water/salts)
3. Vaporization helps in the distribution of ____ in plants.(water/food)
6.5 HOW NEW PLANTS ARE FORMED?
Every organism whether plant or organisms reproduces hisspecies and gives birth to new ones.
Giving birth to a child of itsown type is called reproduction.
Plants reproduce in two ways -through seeds or by stem or leaves.
a. reproducing through seeds and scattering of seeds
Most of the plants reproduce through seeds
but this process isnot an easy one.
"Example - If all the seeds of the plant falls at thesame place and gets sprouted, then all new born plants don't getproper sunlight and nutrients."
Nature has given us a system whereseeds scatter from far off place.
This kind of spreading of seed iscalled scattering.
"There are many methods of seed scattering.For example - air, water or by seeds themselves in their ownmanner."
1. Scattering of seeds by air
"some seeds have feathers or net, fiber comes out from them."
Theseseeds fly away to distance place.
Sehijan seeds have a featherlike shape
"whereas seamal seeds have hair like structure, due tothis factor, seeds fly from one place to another,"
Fruits of gulmehndi after ripening throws itself to a far offplace and get sprouted.
"In the same way peas, beans, fruits ofladyfinger also move from one place and seeds get scattered."
2. seed expansion in organisms
there is a story that squirrels made a jungle.
Squirrel hide seedsin soil while wanting to eat it but forgets it.
This way she hidesseeds in the whole mountain
which came into jungle.
"This is nota story. Birds and animals eat fruits and throw seeds at variousplace,"
"for example - mango, apple, jamun etc."
"In the same waybirds, squirrels, jackal, elephant etc also throw seeds after eatingfruits form one pace to another."
3. Scattering of seeds by water
The best example of seed expansion in water is coconut.
Its fibercover and closed in tight copra coconut falls from trees and istransported by water from one place to another.
6.6 SEEDLINGS OF SEEDS
"Reproduction is a plant gets completes when a seed makes anew pant after getting seedling,"
seeds have a small plants andalso stores food.
"This food is in the form of two seed parts. Example - gram, peas"
or in form if a single seed piece like wheatof maize.
Let us know about the process of seedling:
"1. Seed gets transformed into seedling by water, air (oxygen)and at optimum temperature."
2. The first characteristic of swelling is the swelling of seeds.
3. The cover of seed gets softened.
4. The white portion of seed is called basic seedling which getssprouted
and goes into soil in a long and slanted form.
Thisforms the primary root.
5. Soon after plant forms stem comes out and stands erect at thetop.
This keeps increasing and becomes a small plant.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 6.4
1. What do you mean by reproduction?
2. What is the difference between fruits and seed?
3. Give an example of the following:
i. Scattering of seeds by organisms
ii. Scattering of seeds by air
4. How are blossoms seed scattered?
6.7 REPRODUCTION BY STEM OR LEAVES
"Reproduction of new plants from any other part of plant, notflower is called asexual reproduction."
"This can be root, stem,leaves etc, in different plants,"
let us see some examples -
1. Leaves -
for example cells situated near the corners of leavesin byrofilm leaves
2. Stem like potato (tuber)
"and onions bulb, shalaj"
"3. Grafting , cutting parts of stem of some plants"
like rose orsugarcane and placing them in soil.
4. New plants are grown from pieces of ginger
INTEXT QUESTIONS 6.5
State whether the following statements are true or false:
1. Asexual reproduction is done in brofilin. ( )
"2. If ginger knots are kept in soil, new plants are grown. ( )"
3. Sugarcane cannot be grown from the cut pieces of thestem. ( )
"Basic life processes in organisms are nutrition, breathing,excretion, growth reproduction etc."
Every green plant makes their own food.
The process by which green plants make their own food iscalled photosynthesis.
oxygen gas comes out from this process.
"During breathing glucose is made from carbon dioxide, waterand energy in presence of oxygen."
Food prepared by leaves is sent to stem.
The process of vaporizing of water from water present in plants is called evaporation.
Roots of the plants take absorbed water and minerals to upperpart of the plant.
Reproduction is the process by which organism gives birthto a new species of same like.
There are two types of reproduction -
by seeds and by stemsor leaves.
"Seeds are scatters in many ways - air. Water, organisms andself plant's special seedling method."
The process by which small plants inside the seed gets activeand makes new plant is called sprouting and seedling.

PROCESS OF OUR BODY
Humans have made machines one after the other but the machinemade by nature is matchless.
Humans cannot make a machinethat has power to grow after taking food externally and produceor give birth to offspring like him.
Every activity in human body is wonderful.
To know and learnthese activities is interesting and beneficial.
This will help us ingrowing and remaining healthy.
"There are many systems in our body - moving system, digestivesystem, respiratory system etc."
let us know about these in detail.
"After reading lesson, you will be able to:"
Know the process of human walking
Understanding digestive system and
Explain the process of circulatory system
7.1 HOW CAN WE WALK?
We are not static at one place.
We are movable.
"We move fromone place to another. We can also move our hands, legs, headetc, all these movements are possible by the mixture of twosystems in human body - bones and muscles. All bones togethermake skeleton system and all muscles together make musclesystem."
a. skeleton system
Skeleton is a structure of bones which is hard and gives movementto many parts of body. These give support to the body.
The mainparts of skeleton are:
Skull - box giving protection to human mind
which starts frombrain and ends at spinal cord.
"Ribs - these cover lungs and heart,"
Bones of shoulder and hips
Bones of arms and legs
The total number of bones in our body is 206.
The longest boneis femer
in thighs
and the smallest bone is behind the ear drum
smaller than a grain of rice.
Joints
Joints are those places where one bone gets connected to otherbones.
For example- knee and below joints are moveable andstatic. Example - knee can be static like skull bones.
Movingjoints is a structure that keeps two bones together is called tendon.
Do you know how movements are connected?
You must haveseen the puppet game.
There are threads attached to the puppets.These threads are pulled out to make the movement of puppets.
There are muscles attaches to bones
which move automatically.
There are three more functions of skeleton system
1. it gives shape and support to body.
2. it gives security of soft parts of body
like skull to brain andrib makes lungs and heart secure.
3. bones give place to muscles join and helps in the movement
b. muscle system
There are more than 600 muscles in human body.
All thesemuscles provide movement to bones
"as well as soft body partslike heart, intestines etc."
Types of muscles
There are two types of muscles:
1. Voluntary muscles - these muscles work according to our wish.Example- muscles related to the movements of hands andlegs.
These muscles are connected to bones.
2. Non voluntary muscles - These muscles are not in our control
and keep working automatically.
Intestine muscles or stomachmuscles
work automatically and keeps on forwarding the foodfrom time to time.
Muscles are also found in the walls ofarteries and veins.
Heart muscles are also different in theirstructures. Their structures are related to voluntary musclesbut their work is non voluntary.
This is also called heartmuscles.
All muscles are made up of fiber.
How does a muscle work?
Muscles contract to do work.
"Voluntary muscles on one end arestatic or fixed and together are connected to moving bones,"
whena muscle contracts the movement of the bone happens as bone ispulled towards contracted muscles.
Contracted muscles get smaller and pulls its motion head giving wayto movement.
When contraction ends pulling of bones also ends
andmuscles come back to old form and moves in opposite direction.
Function of muscle system
1. muscles help us the movement of our body organs
"like walking,running or holding objects ."
2. they help us in swallowing and chewing food.
3. they help in expansion and contraction of chest leading to ourbreathing system.
4. they make heart pace muscles etc.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 7.1

3. write the names of organs protecting by the following:
i. Skull
ii. Rib
4. write the name of muscles found in heart wall?
5. what are the special tissues joining one bone to other onmovement called?
7.2 DIGESTION SYSTEM
"Every organism needs food to live,"
there are five steps of nutritionor food intake to its usage.
1. the process of taking food inside by eating or drinking.
2. making food ready for energy absorption or digestion.
3. digested food passes through food pipe and gets absorbed inbody through intestines.
"4. Absorbed food is used in the necessary required places ofhuman body,"
5. Non absorbed and non digested food comes out in form ofwaste from body.
a. parts of digestion system
1. mouth - teeth present inside our mouth cuts the food intopieces.
"Our salvia glands excrete salvia which softens the food,"
the enzyme present in salvia changes starch present in food tosoluble maltose.
There are two sets of teeth: temporary (milkteeth) (20)
which falls down and permanent teeth (20 and 12)come out.
Out of 12 temporary teeth every jaw has three teethon both sides to chew the food.
In the end one last wisdomtooth
comes out around 16-17 year. A wisdom tooth does notcome out in some people.
"There are many types of teeth in ajaw set which are used in chewing, cutting, grinding andmixing of food."
2. food is softened by mouth - salvia helps in chewing the food.This is secreted by the tongue. Tongue and teeth chew thefood.
Mostly the push of tongue helps the food to reach thefood pipe.
3. Food reaches a bag like stomach from food pipe.
4. food stays in stomach for 3-4 hours.
"By this time the juicefrom the walls of stomach mixes with food,"
this gastric juicehas pepsin enzyme which helps in digestion of protein.
Onemore acid comes out from this juice called hydrochloric acid.This acid destroys any bacteria coming with the food.
Foodreaches small intestine from stomach.
5. small intestine is around 7 meter long
with narrow structure.It has many spiral structures.
"Maximum food get digested here,"
"protein, carbohydrates, maltose, sucrose etc and fats aredigested by many enzymes."
These enzymes come out from pancreas and even small intestine.
Digestion is not neededfrom vitamins and mineral salts
they are absorbed directly inintestine.
"6. big intestine: small intestine is connected to big intestine,"
heremaximum water of the left food is absorbed.
"Voluntary muscles on one end arestatic or fixed and together are connected to moving bones,"
INTEXT QUESTIONS 7.2
1. how many teeth are there in the human mouth?
"Voluntary muscles on one end arestatic or fixed and together are connected to moving bones,"
3. which part of digestion pipe absorbs maximum water?
4. which juice is excreted by the walls of stomach?
7.3 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
You have leant about the respiration process of plants.
All livingorganisms including humans also breathe.
Our body needs energyfor many activities 24 hours a day.
This energy is used inside thecells during breathing. It uses oxygen to disintegrate glucose fromfood.
a. parts of respiratory system
"all the organs nose, lungs etc exchange blood and atmosphericair in between themselves. All these make respiratory system,"
allthese organs in sequence are:
A. nose
Air outside from the world enters our body through two nostrilsor nose holes.
The three characteristics of nose are:
1. the hair inside the nose stops dust etc from air entering ourbody.
"2. a sticky element, shesleshma, excreted from nose sticks itselfwith virus and bacteria and other particles and stops themfrom entering body."
3. air going through nostrils keeps the temperature of body warmand moisture.
B. Food pipe
This is the back part of our mouth which takes air inside and food intake by our mouth is same.
The bottom part of pipe isLarynx which opens in vocal cords which opens in breathingpipe.
Remember it is a structure epitolits which protects the gatesof vocal cords
so that the food ontake does not go inside the foodpipe.
But if it gets then food gets stuck in breathing pipe.
C. Respiration pipe
This is a straight pipe going to the centre of chest starting fromvocal cords.
"There are cartilages, spiral in shape, in its wallswhich does not make it sticky."
Breathing cells and veins
"Breathing pipe is divided in two parts - from back of head whichis called swahashnitan, breathing centre."
Both the cells enterlungs from their sides.
They get divided into small branches insidelungs
"which is called shawahansikayen, breathing cells."
"Air passage, vayukosh"
Breathing cells are opened in
the end point of closed air passage.
These are lakhs in number
and their total internal surface can bemore than a big kabbadi stadium.
they have a large surface so thatthey can exchange respiratory gases more and more.
Those peoplewho smoke cigarette and bidi have many side effects on their airpassage. It gets closed
and they suffer from respiratory diseases.
Lungs
These are a pair of sponge bag like structure
which are close tothe walls of chest.
Blood having more carbon dioxide and less oxygen reach lungs.
"Many minute branches of blood cells coverair passage and they became blood veins, lung veins, after manymovements."
These lung vein join together to form a primary lungveins which reaches heart.
Blood reaching heart from lungs isfull of oxygen.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 7.3
1. Which way of food and breathing is similar and which part?
2. Fill in the blanks:
i. Division of breathing cells make_____.
ii. Blood entering lungs is full of _ but when it comes out oflungs it is full of ____.
7.4 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Have you ever though that how digested food from food pipeand absorbed food from body reaches every cell?
"Carbon dioxidefrom all body parts and other waste elements related to wastematerials, kidney, lungs etc?"
All there works are done by a pumpheart and artery coming out and reaching there. Blood flowingfrom there also helps in its functioning.
A. Heart
If you keep our hand at a slight left side you will hear or fellheart beat. This sounds like dhak dhak.
This happens with everyhuman heart beat.
Heart is a small muscular organ
equal size of a fist
andis established between the lungs in a cage.
This is made upof tight muscles which work throughout life and does not gettired.
1. Functions of heart
The heart of a healthy adult person beats 60-80 times per minute
average 72 beats per minute.
There are four chambers of heart
two in upper side right -left atria
and bottom left -right ventricles.
Right side of heart side has less oxygen blood and more carbondioxide blood which reaches lungs.
The pumped blood from lungswhich has less amount of carbon dioxide and more oxygenreaches to the left side of heart where blood vessels take thisblood to every cell of human body.
2. Blood carrier cells or vessels
These are of three types:
i. Arteries - these take blood containing oxygen to various partsof the body from heart.
Their walls are thick and muscular.
"ii. Veins - they bring oxygen less blood from many parts of bodyto heart,"
then this blood is sent to lungs.
"iii. cells - Arteries are divided in many branches and they joinagain together to form veins, this is a cage of veins."
Minuteblood cells in this system are called cells.
3. Blood
Blood is a shining red coloured liquid which flows in arteriesand veins.
"Our blood has red blood cells and white blood cells.White blood cells are actually colourless, it also has very minuteblood platelets."
Functions of blood
i. it takes oxygen from lungs to various parts of the body.
ii. it also takes absorbed food from intestine to many parts ofwhole body.
iii. blood also takes waste material from body cells to kidney sothat they come out as a part of urine.
iv. it also protects our body from infection.
v. it also controls body temperature and keeps it static.
vi. if there is any injury or cut then blood clotting happens andstops the flowing of blood.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 7.4

2. how many times a heart beats in one minute of a normal adulthuman?
3. what is the real color of white blood cells present in blood?
The organ system of our body does not function alone but all together with coordination.
The movements of our body are the dynamic system
andcontrols bones and muscles.
"The main function of skeleton system is to give shape to body,support it ,"
contribute in movements
and protecting soft organsetc.
All the muscles of a body together form muscular system.
muscles give body movement
and produces beating in heart.
Digestion system makes food easily digestible and absorbsnutritional elements.
There are two types of breathing -
first breathing from lungsboth - intake and exhale
in which oxygen is taken insideand carbon dioxide is released
and second type blood sendsabsorbed oxygen to body cells for making energy which isused for cell breathing.
Circulatory system sends nutrients and oxygen to their usefulorgans and takes carbon dioxide and other wastes from variousparts of human body.

VARIOUS ORGANS OFOUR BODY
You have learnt about many organs of our body.
Every organ ofthe body has a different function.
But every organ functions makean organism healthy and keep specie alive.
Look at any construction site around you. You will find somegarbage or waste material.
This too happens with body.
To throwsuch waste material out of human body we have excretion system.
When many people work together then a system is required forco-ordination.
This too happens with body.
"Since many systemsare working together, there can be no chaos. Therefore, acoordinating system is required."
This function is done by nervoussystem and control system in our body.
We will learn aboutexcretion system and nervous system in this lesson.
"After learning this lesson, you will be able to:"
Understand the importance of excretion system in human body.
Describe the function of excretion system of human body
Tell the meaning of nervous system and
Explain the functions of nervous system
8.1 EXCERTION SYSTEM
Every cell of our body keeps on doing something or the other.
"Therefore, some garbage is always found there."
These elementsare harmful and should not be collected in body. It should bethrown out of the human body.
The process of throwing outharmful or waste material is called excretion
and the groups oforgans related to it are called excretion system.
Our body excretes or excretion by three types:
1. lungs: we throw out polluted carbon dioxide produced duringbreathing.
2. skin: some mineral salts are bit required by our body are thrownout in form of sweating.
"3. Urine: Our body comprises of water,"
a balance of wateris required in human body.
It should not be more or less.
Urine takes out chemical wastes and extra water out of ourbody.
Urine system
There are many parts of urine system:
1. kidney: these look like a pair of seed of beans shaped organs.
Functions of kidney
a. To separate impurities of blood especially urea which reachkidney by artery
b. To create a balance between water and Mineral salts inbody
2. Urethra: there is a urethra from every kidney which reachesdown bladder.
Its functions is to take urine to bladder.
3. Bladder: this is like a flexible bag.
It is used to store urinetemporarily
4. Urine pipe: this is a pipe made up of small muscles to takeout urine from the body time to time.
"If one of our kidney stops working, then the other starts workingdouble."
If both kidneys get damaged then these can be transplanted by medicines.
this is the reason why organ donationis promoted now a days.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 8.1
1. What do you mean by excretion?
2. What are the three methods by which waste material comesout of human body?
3. Write the sequences of various parts of urine system?
4. How urine comes out of kidney and by which structure?
5. Which is the organ that stores urine temporarily ?
8.2 NERVOUS SYSTEMS
"We must know whatever is happening around us what, why andhow?"
"How our food tastes - eatable or rotten, bad smell and noneatable? How do we know all these things?"
"We see people,identify them, listen to their thoughts and speak our thoughtsetc."
""
All these co-ordinating activities are done by our brain andnerves which is called nervous system.
1. Parts of nervous system
"Various organs of our body form nervous system,"
following arethe parts of nervous system-
1. brain
2. Spinal cord
3. nerves
4. sensory organs
1. brain -
human brain is a soft and delicate part.
It is around 3 to5 kg kilograms in an adult.
This part is safe in skull.
Human brain is the biggest size in all living organisms.
It has theonly secret of how humans can do all other works that otherorganisms cannot do.
Parts of brain
i. Fore brain: this is the biggest part of brain.
Its main function is to think and remember.
"This part is related to will power,intelligence and consciousness."
"It also gives us other areasrelated to knowledge centre like speaking, seeing, taste andsmell."
ii. Mid brain:: this s a small part found below fore brain andback side of skull.
Its function is to control muscles.
iii. Medulla oblongata - this is also known as pillar of brain.
Itsfunction is to control involuntary activities
like heart rateand exhale breathing.
2. Spinal cord
this is a pipe like structure
"Various organs of our body form nervous system,"
All message sent frombrain to body reach by this pipe.
This also helps in giving fastreaction
like if a thorn pricks than we take our hand backinternally.
3. nerves
nerves are small and slippery white structures whichmake messages from brain like electric current.
"All thenerves coming out of brain, skull and spinal cord are called spinalnerves"
Types of nerves
"1. Sensory nerves - these nerves take messages from sensoryorgans like eyes, nose, ears etc and sent them to brain."
2. Central nerves - these nerves come out from dynamic ormoving organs
"like muscles relating to eyes and around eyeswith brain,"
Mixed nerves- These nerves are for both
"sending andreceiving messages,"
there are 31 pairs of nerves coming outof spinal cord.
Functions of nervous system
"1. These nerves control our reaction coming out of externalnervous system world,"
2. It also controls other system of the body.
"3. it helps in the moving movements as we want like walking,doing movements etc."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 8.2
1. What is the name of the system coordinating various activitiesof the body?
2. What are the four main parts of our nervous system?
3. Where is our brain situated?
4. What are the three main parts of human mind?
5. Which part is your brain controls your emotions?
6. Where is the centre for controlling heart beating located?
8.3 OUR SENSORY ORGANS
"Organs which tell us about the presence, element or taste of anyobjects are called sensory organs,"
"we can see, listen or feel bythese organs"
we have five sensory organs
"eyes, ears, nose, tongueand skin."
1. eyes- eyes are essential to read and see objects around us.
When a light ray comes to eyes from an object than nervesinside our eyes get stimulated and sends messages to brain.
Brain reads the messages and draws a whole picture of theobject.
We can see and understand many surrounding objects by thismethod.
"2. Ear- these are spreading on face. The sensory nerves inside ears get shook and hearnews is sent as message to the brain,"
They take sound waves insidethe body.
this also shows thebalance of body which can be seen through ear.
3. Nose - nose helps in sending smell of various kinds andmessage to brains.
We can identity many tasty foods by smellonly.
4. Tongue- this helps un identifying taste of various types
"likesweet, sour, bitter, warm , hot, salty etc."
"5. Skin - this sensory organs tell us about pain, feel, warm- cold,hard-soft etc by touching."
"Some of the areas of skin havehigh degrees of touch like fingers on head, hot-cold at somearea like cheeks etc."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 8.3
1. List the sensory organs found in our body?
2. How does our eye identify an object?
3. How does tongue identify taste?
4. What is the other function of ear besides hearing?
Taking out of harmful products produced by physical activityin body is called excretion.
"Lungs, skin and kidney help in excretion."
Mainly excretion is done by urethra.
"There are two kidney inurine system, two ureter, bladder and urine pipe coming outof them."
Nervous system tells us about outside world and coordinatedwith internal organs of the body.
"The main parts of nervous system are brain, spinal cord, nervesand sensory organs."
"Brain is the centre of forebrain thinking, intelligence etc andmidbrain controls the movement of muscles."
Spine bone is fixed in back bone and is the medium of sending messages to the brain.
"There are three kinds of nerves namely, sensory nerves, motornerves ad mixed nerves."

HEALTHY LIFE ANDCLEANLINESS
"You must have heard of the saying, 'health is wealth'."
We alwayswant that we should not fall ill. We eat properly to work in abetter way.
By doing this we will be happy and healthy.
Peoplearound us will be happy seeing us happy.
This is called healthylife.
Healthy life means a body free from diseases and a mindfree from mental problems.
"To be healthy we require cleaning our body, follow good habitsand take healthy and proper diet."
Exercise and taking rest is alsoimportant.
"If we have the deficiency of any element in our body,it will make us dull, ill and suffer from many diseases."
To saveourselves from diseases we should have immunity power to fightdiseases.
Immunity power can be increased by vaccination andproper diet.
Our ancient scriptures have laid emphasis on it.
"Evenayurveda says that we should live balanced life, exercise dailyand follow rules"
to be healthy and to live a long life.
It is said'jiveta Sharad Shatam'.
Let us now understand what important for a healthy life isin this lesson.
"After understanding this lesson, you will be able to:"
Tell the importance of food for the body ;
Describe the importance of necessary nutrition elements forthe body ;
Explain the diseases cause because of deficiency of somenutrients ;
Explain balance diet ;
Describe the importance of cleanliness for good health
9.1 FOOD AND ITS NUTRIENTS
"You must have felt that whenever we feel hungry, we eat food."
Food not only ends our hunger but also gives us energy.
Foodgives energy to do some essential elements required for theimportant works of the body.
All the elements found in foodwhich are essential for our body are called nutrients.
"Variousnutrient elements found on our food are carbohydrates, protein,fats, vitamins and mineral salts etc."
Let us know about from where we can find nutrients what aretheir functions and which diseases are caused by their deficiency.
a) carbohydrates
"This is an important element in our food,"
"the main function ofcarbohydrates is to provide energy for physical work like playing,learning, working in a farm or factory etc."
"Whenever you aresitting or sleeping, various activities also take place like breathing,pumping of heart, food digestion etc."
We require energy for theseprocesses also.
Do you know that carbohydrates contributes inmaking a food tasty?
"The main food elements in our food which gives us energy areall types of grains like wheat, rice, maize, millet, bajra, ragi etc."
"we also get energy from roots kandmool, example, potato, arbi, turnip, sugarcane, banana etc."
"other sources of carbohydrate aresugar, honey and jiggery."
"If we take extra carbohydrates in ourbody, they get deposited in the form of fats in our body."
If the intake of carbohydrates in less in our body then our weightgets reduced and we feel tired.
b) Protein
Protein is essential for the development of body.
"Therefore, wemust consume protein rich food. This helps us in building ofnew cells, tissues, organs, hormones and hemoglobin, red pigmentin blood. It also helps in the maintenance of damaged cells."
"Allpulses like masoor, moong, urad, rajma etc gave high protein."
"Our body also gets protein from milk, curd, paneer, meat, fisheggs etc."
9.2 SOURCES OF PROTEIN
Children need protein in more quantity.
This element is importantfor their growth.
Less consumption of protein leads to lessdevelopment of body and mind
lack of energy and malnutrition is causedby the lack of protein in food.
This malnutrition is of two types-Kwashiorkor and marasmus.
Kwashiorkor : This is caused mainly by the lack of protein.
"Here the child has swelling on his hand, legs and face, he alsosuffers from loose motions. He gets a fat belly."
Marasmus : This disease is caused because of less carbohydratesintake in food by child.
His muscles start drying up.
He gets wrinkles on his skin.
This disease is also called dry disease. Child cannotgrow in this disease and his skeleton can be seen in his body.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 9.1
Fill in the blanks:
1. Carbohydrates provide _____ for doing many physicalactivities.
2. Protein elements help in the _____ of new tissues in our body.
"3. Child gets _____ on his hands, legs and face and has _____ inKwashiorkor disease."
4. Less intake of carbohydrates leads to _____ disease.
5. Child muscles get dried up and _____ are on skin in marasmusdisease.
c) fat
fat gives us energy.
It gives a soft layer on the heart.
Thereforeheart does not get damaged by a push or injury.
"Some vitamins (like a, d, e, k ) are soluble in fat and fat helps us in gettingthem from the food. Fats are important to make our body work"
"various food items like bitter, ghee, cream, malai, oil (mustard,cocount, groundnut, til etc) give fat."
But extra fat is not goodfor health.
Therefore we must take foods giving fat in a limitedmanner.
"Ghee, butter and malai consumption can be dangerousto elderly people."
Fats give more energy than carbohydrates whenneeded.
Mineral salts
We require very less amount of mineral salts found in our food.
"But for the proper functioning and growth of human body, mineralsalts are required"
"for example - for building blood in human body,iron is required."
"Therefore, it is essential to have mineral salts inour food."
There are various sources of getting mineral salts. Wewill read their functions and diseases cause by their deficiencyare given later in this chapter.
d) Calcium
calcium helps in building bones and teeth.
It also controls thespeed of muscles.
"We get calcium form milk, paneer, curd, buttermilk, green leafy vegetables (spinach, reddish, cauliflower, methi,arbi ke patte, bajra, black grans) etc."
Its deficiency leads toweakness of bones and their deformation.
teeth also get weak bythe deficiency of calcium.
e) iron element
iron is required for the building hemoglobin a red pigment foundin red blood cells in blood.
"It is mostly found in green leafyvegetables, Bajra, chidwa, ragi, murmura, jaggery, roasted gram,masoor dal, fish etc."
The deficiency of iron leads to a diseasecalled anemia. Anemia refers to the deficiency of red blood cells.
Patient feels weak and his breathing is abnormal.
His nails getyellow. He does not feel good to eat something.
f) iodine
"This salt is essentials for the growth, development and functioningof biological activities."
The most common source of iodine issalt with iodine.
Iodine is also found in extra amount in foodobtained from sea.
Deficiency of iodine leads to goiter.
It alsoleads to the swelling of thyroid glands.
Deficiency of iodine leadsto improper growth of children.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 9.2
1. Which functions of human body are related to calcium?
2. why is iron important for us?
3. write any two sources of iodine?
4. match the following
Mineral salts ----- deficiency disease
Iodine ----- deformed bones
Calcium ----- anemia (less blood)
Iron ----- goiter
9.4 VITAMIN
There is an importance of vitamins like other nutrient elements.
Vitamins are required for many biological activities in humanbody.
There are required in small amount.
"There are many typesof vitamins like a, b, c,c d, e, k etc."
"Let us know can we get vitamins, what are their functions andwhat are the diseases caused by their deficiency."
1. vitamin a
"It helps in proper functioning of eyes, keeping skin healthy andboosting immunity power of body to fight disease."
"This is foundin bajra, papapya, sitafal, carrot, mango, yellow maize, greenleafy vegetables, like, egg, butter, fish etc."
"deficiency of vitamincauses night blindness,"
patient cannot see properly in dim lightin this disease.
More deficiency of vitamin a causes blindness.
2. vitamin d
It is essential for building bones and increasing their strength.
Vitamin d is build by our body with the help of sunlight.
This isthe cheap and simple medium of getting vitamin D.
"vitamin D isalso found in fish oil, egg and kaleji."
"Deficiency of vitamin dcauses rickets,"
bones get weak and legs get deformed in shape ofbow.
3. vitamin e
This vitamin is required for reproduction capacity
"this ismostly found in vanaspati oil, fish, egg, flour with choker, milk etc."
Its deficiency causes sterility meaning less reproductivecapacity.
4. vitamin k
This vitamin helps in blood clotting after an injury;
"the mainsources of vitamin k are green leafy vegetables, cauliflower,cabbage etc."
deficiency of vitamin k causes more time in bloodclotting after an injury which can be dangerous.
5. vitamin b complex
"Many vitamins are found in this group of vitamins, example b12."
These are necessary for the development and growth of body.
"They keep our muscles and skin healthy,"
"some of the sources ofvitamin b complex are - sabot and sprouted pulses, milk and itsproduct."
Deficiency of vitamin b causes bery-beri.
This leads toless hunger and problem in digestion.
"The corners of mouth getcut,"
"tongue gets rough and red, misbalance in biological processis caused by the deficiency of vitamin b complex."
6. vitamin c
It is essential for wound filling.
"This keeps our skin, teeth,bones, healthy and strong."
It also gives power to fight diseases.
"It is found in raw fruits and vegetables, amla, lemon, grapes,tomato, sprouted pulses, sahjan ki fali etc,"
"deficient of vitamin ccauses scurvy,"
gums get swollen and blood starts coming out ofthem.
It takes time to cure wounds and immunity power getslessened.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 9.3
State whether the given statements are true or false:
1. Vitamin a helps in proper functioning of eyes.
2. vitamin e helps in blood clotting.
3. Deficiency of vitamin d deforms legs and gives them a bow shape.
4. deficiency of vitamin c leads to less reproductive capacity.
"5. guava, lemon and orange are good sources ofvitamin a."
6. beri beri is caused by the deficiency of vitamin b.
7. gums get swollen by the deficiency of vitamin c.
9.5 OTHER ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF FOOD
Other nutrients which are required for good health include waterand fiber. These are essential for a good health.
let us know moreabout it.
Water: water is required for all biological activities of humanbody.
"About 55% of human body is water,"
water is required tokeep human temperature normal (98.4 degree Fahrenheit or 37degree Celsius).
We require more water in summer.
We shouldalways drink water and other liquid drinks.
We should alwaysdrink 7-8 glass of water every day.
Fiber: fiber is also an important part of our food eating.
Eatingfiber in optimum quantity helps us in constipation and providesproper digestion of food.
It also supports proper excretion out of human body.
Eating good amount of fiber saves us from obesity.
"We get required fiber from green leafy vegetables, fruits, sabotgrains, pulses etc."
9.6 BALANCED DIET
To be healthy we require nutrient elements in optimum quality.
Eating all essential nutrients in optimum quantity in our food iscalled balanced diet.
We could not get all nutrient elements byeating same food every day.
We must mix and inter change manyfood items for a balanced diet.
Balanced diet is a diet which hasall essential items required by our body in optimum amount.
1. malnutrition
Have you ever thought what are the harmful effects of not havinga balanced diet?
Our body gets deficient after not taking balanceddiet.
This might also lead to the maximum intake of some nutrientelements.
This is called mal nutrition.
2. alp poshan
After eating less than required food or intake of few nutrients
causes less nutrition.
Many diseases can be caused because offewer nutrients. Body does not get all sufficient minerals in properquantity.
3. ati poshan
Do you know that obesity is also a disease?
"Some people eatmore than required and do less physical activity,"
because of this fat gets deposited in human body and the person get obese orfatty.
This is called ati poshan.
Many diseases like diabetes bloodpressure etc are caused because of obesity.
"Therefore, we musteat sweets, butter, ghee etc in proper amount."
"We should eat rawfruits, green vegetables, sabot grains, pulses and fiber in goodquantity to save ourselves from obesity."
Diet group
"We eat many types of food product everyday like roti, pulses,rice, vegetables, curd etc."
This is possible that some mineralelements are high in some product and other nutrition elementsare less.
There are mainly five categories of diet
based onnutritional elements found in them.
The benefit of dividing foodproducts in these categories is that we can exchange the categoryof food with the other.
"If we eat only one type of food productthen we will get same nutrient cements,"
"for example if we eatwheat or maize flour, rice or bajra, we will get same nutrients."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 9.4
1. What is the meaning of balanced diet?
2. Why is fiber important in food ?
3. Why is water important for us?
9.7 NEED FOR CLEANLINESS
You have read of diseases which are caused by the deficiency ofnutrients.
"But some diseases are caused by the uncleanatmosphere around us,"
some diseases are transmitted from one person to another.
Such diseases are called communicablediseases.
"These are spread by coughing, sneezing, breathing, usingdirty water and dirty food where mosquitoes-flies etc. sits."
"Somecommunicable disease are typhoid, measles, cholera, corona,polio, malaria etc,"
"therefore, it is necessary to clean our houseand neighbourhood to save us from diseases. Personal hygieneand cleanliness is also very important."
Let us learn about it.
1. Personal hygiene
The meaning of personal hygiene is to keep all our organs cleanand care for them.
It is important to follow some good habits.
Some of the habits are as follows;
Doing shouch everyday
cleaning our hands every time afterusing toilet.
"doing brush or datun twice a day,"
"taking bath everyday from clean water,"
"eating food after washing hands,"
washing hair regularly and combing them
Cutting nails regularly and cleaning them
sleeping at least 6-7 hours at night
walking and doing exercise twice a day-morning or evening
Caring of organs of body
"fter all good habits some various organs of body like eyes,nose, ear, teeth etc require cleanliness and caring."
1.teeth: to keep teeth clean we require to brush twice a day-every morning and every evening.
"Our teeth gets rotten if weeat more sweet toffees, candies, sweets etc."
teeth gets yellow.There come a bad smell from our moth and cavities also stickin our teeth.
We should eat raw fruits and vegetables to makeour teeth healthy and strong.
2. eyes: to clean our eyes we should wash them from clean watermany times.
We should not rub our eyes by dust or some dustparticles as they move inside our eyes.
We should not usekajal or soorma in our eyes.
"Learning or reading by lyingdown bed, reading in a moving vehicle or in less light damageseye."
If there is flu or vision problem or injury in eye contactan eye specialist immediately.
3. ear: ear helps you in listening to a conversation going near toyou.
Sometimes there is a dust deposited in ears which needsto be cleaned from time to time.
"We should not use any pointedobject (pin, needle etc) to clean our ear,"
this might damageour ear drum and we might become deaf.
Ears also getdamaged by listening high music.
We can also clean our earsin guidance of an ear specialist.
We should consult an earspecialist immediately if we have pain or injury in our ear.
4. skin: skin helps us in taking out polluted elements from ourbody.
This also helps in maintaining the normal temperatureof the body.
Therefore we should take bath regularly withclean water.
If we don't do this then allergic reactions comesout and cause many diseases.
5. nails: dirty nails takes dirt in our stomach with the help offood.
"Many types of diseases like loose motions, dysentery,vomiting or pain in stomach happen through dirty nails."
"Therefore, we must wash our hands after going toilets orbefore eating food."
"6. hairs: we should wash our hairs twice a week by a mild soap,shampoo or ritha amala."
We should also give massage to ourhairs with warm oil.
"If we don't unclean hair fall happens.More lice can be found there,"
this can lead to dandruff orbaldness.
If there is pain or injury n anybody part then we should consult adoctor.
Self-medication can be dangerous.
Cleaning environment
Cleaning environment means to keep our house or neighbouringareas clean.
"We should keep our surrounding clean as virus orbacteria are born in dirty environment,"
we can do this in thefollowing ways:
1. we should throw all the garbage of home and kitchen in a liddustbin every day.
2. we should spread mosquito killer in drainage of our homesand surroundings.
3. Stop the collection of dirty water near our home to saveourselves from mosquitoes and flies.
4. Mop the pakka floors with phenyl.
5.there should be roof above the well so that the water of thewell does not get dirty and polluted.
6. we should place a lid over drinking water.
Exercise
Regular exercise is important for good health and saves us fromdiseases.
Indian scripture also advise physical exercise for healthybody.
"Exercise does not mean doing pushups but doing or sowingseeds in our farms, nirai-gudai, field work, ploughing fields,walking, jumping, playing, doing household work etc are alsotypes of exercises."
This develops our muscles and we experience activeness andfreshness.
maharishi patanjalii has explained many methods ofexercise in yog sutra which help in keeping our body healthy.
rest and sleep
You must have seen that we feel tired after working or playingand jumping.
"After taking rest for some time we feel fresh again,"
we must sleep from 6 to 7 hours for better health.
"Therefore, proper rest and proper sleep is required for good health. Proper diet helps in increasing the immunity power of ourbody."

Elements found in our home which are good and essential for human body are called nutrients.
"Some of the common nutrients found n food are - protein,carbohydrates, fats, minerals, salts and vitamins."
Balance diet is a diet which contains all the required elementsby the body in optimum quantity.
Mal nutrition is caused in absence of balanced diet.
It is oftwo types- alp poshan and atiposhan.

Sounds of Sanskrit language are described in Maheshwara Sutras.
There are basic of Sanskrit grammar.
All the Vowels and Consonants are told in there Maheshwara Sutras.
recite all 14 Maheshwara Sutras;
know Sanskrit Sounds; and
identify the Pratyaharas.
There is story behind the Samskrita alphabets.
Nataraja is other name of Shiva.
He is in the dancing pose.
Nataraja has Damaru in his one hand.
"Damaru is a small two-headed drum, used in many Indian, Buddhist and Tibetan traditions."
Damru is known as the instrument of Lord Shiva.
Damaru was first created by Shiva to produce different sounds.
Sanskrit Alphabets origined from  the  sound  of  the  Damaru  of  the  Lord  Shiva  called Maheswara Sutras.
"Mãhesvara Sutrani is fourteen verses that organize the phonemes of  Sanskrit  as  referred  to  in  the Astadhyayi  of  Panini,  the foundational text of Sanskrit grammar."
A famous verse in Sage Panini's Ashtadhyayi says that the Panini grammar that is in use now is graced by Lord Shiva.
Hence the first  known  organized  sounds  are  known  as  the  Maheshvara Sutra - Maheshvara being another name of Lord Shiva.
Here is the verse from Panini's Ashta-Dhyayi:
"At  the  end  of  his  cosmic  dance,  Shiva,  the  Lord  of  dance, with a view to bless the sages Sanaka and so on, played on his Damaru  fourteen  times,  from  which  emerged  the  following fourteen Sutras, popularly known as Shiva Sutras or Maheshvara Sutras"
"Within the tradition they are known as the Aksarasamamnaya,recitation of phonemes, but they are popularly known as the Siva Sutras because they are said to have been revealed to Panini by Shiva."
They were either composed by Panini to accompany his Astadhyayi or predate him.
"These  fourteen  sutras  contain  all  the  letters  of  the  sanskrit varnamala- the svaras (vowels) a, i, u, r, lr, e, ai, o, au and all the  vyanjanas  (consonants)."
"You  find  half  letters  in  the  end of each Sutra for a reason. As per the Rig Veda, Lord Siva brought this  Sanskrit  alphabet  sequence  and  the  Sanskrit  language  to earth."
The sounds of the alphabet originated from Lord Siva's damaru'.
The Sanskrit alphabet sequence is known as the 'Varna-mala'.
"The word 'varna' (o.kZ) means a 'syllable' and all the energies related to that syllable - color, presiding force, the mouth part used to pronounce each syllable, the related body part etc."
"Pratyahara is bringing together; bringing together of several letters (or words in a few cases, such as roots or nouns) by mentioning the first and the last only for the sake of brevity; the term izR;kgkj is generally used in connection with brief terms such as v.k~] vd~] vp~] gy~ and the like, created by Panini in his grammar by taking any particular letter and associating it with any mute final letter (vuqcU/k) of the fourteen Sivasutras, with a view to include all letters beginning with the letter uttered and ending with the letter which  precedes  the  (mute)  letter."
"The  practice  of  using  such abbreviations  was  in  existence  before  Panini,  possibly  in  the grammar attributed to Indra."
"Economy  (Sanskrit:  laghava)  is  a  major  principle  of  their organization,  and  it  is  debated  whether  Panini  deliberately encoded phonological patterns in them (as they were treated in traditional phonetic texts called Pratyhara) or simply grouped together phonemes which he needed to refer to in the Ashta dhyayi and which only secondarily reflect phonological patterns."
"As an example, consider Ashtadhyayi 6.1.77: iKo yan aCi:"
"iK means i, u, r, ir;"
"iKo is iK in the genitive case, so it means ' in place of i, u, r, ir;"
"yan means the semivowels y v r l and is in the nominative, so iKo yan means: y v r l replace i u r ir;"
"aC means all vowels, as noted above"
"aCi is in the locative case, so it means before any vowel."
"Hence  this  rule  replaces  a  vowel  with  its  corresponding semivowel when followed by any vowel, and that is why dadhi together with atra makes dadhyatra."
Mahesvara  Sutrani  are………..verses  that  organize  the phonemes of Sanskrit.
Ashtadhyaya was written by…………..
………………  brought  out  the  sequence  of  alphabets  of Sanskrita.
The sanskrit alphabet sequence is known as the …………….
Maheswara Sutra is the most ancient known Sanskrit alphabet sequence.
Sanskrit Alphabets originates from Maheswara Sutras.
"There is fourteen verses that organize the phonemes of Sanskrit as referred to in the Ashtdhyayi of Panini, the foundational text of Sanskrit grammar."
"The  fourteen  sutras  contain  all  the  letters  of  the  Sanskrit varnamala- the svaras (Vowels) a, i, u, r, ir, e, ai, o, au and all the vyanjanas (Consonants)."

"In our lifetime, we come across with different kind of people."
We may be different in many ways.
"But also we may have some similarities, something common which makes us one."
"These may be common goals, inner values  for the society and follow the right path to reach our goals. Our ancient texts are full with such values and suggesting the right ways to humankind."
This lesson discuss about some shlokas of Bhagwad Gita through a beautiful story.
recite 18 shlokas of Samarasya-Shloka-Sangraha; and
know that there are different paths to one goal.
"There  was  a  mountain.  There  were  four  villages  around  the mountain;  Ramapura,  Bharatapura,  Lavapura  and  Kushapura."
None of the villages were connected to each other.
The people in the villages did not know each other.
"Every time the people of each village looked at the mountain, they could see a big white flag."
They thought it's the representation of their village and there must  be a message for the villagers.
"On one fine day, four boys from each village wanted to go close and know the details of that flag. However, they were not aware that boys from other villages are doing the same. As it was going to take long way to reach the peak, so they packed food for afternoon lunch and set out for climbing the mountain."
"By the time they reached the mountain peak and were just little bit behind from the flag, they were all really tired, so wanted to eat lunch and have a small nap. Surprisingly, all the boys from all the villages met in one point. Boys of four villages exchanged their reasons to climb the mountain."
"Interestingly, all of them had the same goal to find about the white flag."
"As soon as all the boys go close to the flag, they read a message for all the villagers."
"'This white flag is the symbol of brotherhood of people of four village, once a while people should come here and spend time together to celebrate New Year''."
Reading this message made all the boys very happy and started coming together annually.
"See the example here - one mountain, four villages, four paths leading to one goal towards flag."
"Ramapura had a path of stones and  jerky  way, Bharatapura  had  bushy  and  thorn  full  plants, Lavapura  had  high  trees  and  clear  path  and  Kushapura  had slippery path."
All the paths lead to the peak and to the flag.
"There may be differences in the nature of path, but all of them lead to the same goal."
"Bhagavad Gita, has the shlokas explaining four streams or paths in our life to reach the goal, liberation from the bondage."
These four paths are:
Jnana Yoga (The path of knowledge)
Karma Yoga (The path of action)
Bhakti Yoga (The path of emotion culture)
Raja Yoga (The path of will power)
To achieve the goals these four paths were followed by different persons. Let's know some of the examples of the followers of these paths:
Jnana Yoga  - Adi Shankaracharya
Karma Yoga - Lord Sri Krishna
Bhakti Yoga - Meera and Lord Hanuman
Raja Yoga - Maharshi Patanjali

Divine mother, she who showers Elixir of Advaita on us, O ! mother of 18 chapters, I meditate on thee, O !

"He to whom censure and praise are equal, who is silent, content with anything, homeless, of a steady mind, and full of devotion that man is dear to me."
"Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat the same, engage thou in battle for the sake of battle; thus thou shall not incur sin."
"One sees This (the Self) as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It as a wonder; yet, having heard, none understands It at all."
"He  who  is  free  from  attachment,  non-egoistic,  endowed  with firmness and enthusiasm and unaffected by success or failure, is called Sattwic."
"With their minds and lives entirely absorbed in Me, enlightening each other and always speaking of Me, they are satisfied and delighted."
"Many births of Mine have passed, as well as of thine, O Arjuna! I know them all but thou knowest not, O Parantapa!"
"He who is ever free from the egoistic notion, whose intelligence is not tainted by (good or evil), though he slays these people, he slayeth not, nor is he bound (by the action)."
"Learn  from  Me  in  brief,  O  Arjuna,  how  he  who  has attained  perfection  reaches  Brahman,  that  supreme  state  of knowledge."
"At the time of death, with unshaken mind, endowed with devotion and by the power of Yoga, fixing the whole life breath in the middle of the two eyebrows, he reaches that resplendent Supreme Person."
"Fly  unto  Him  for  refuge  with  all  thy  being,  O Arjuna!  By His  Grace  thou  shalt  obtain  supreme  peace  and  the  eternal abode."
