"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
"And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:"
"And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;"
And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
"And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.
"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost."
"Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily."
"But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost."
"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."
"Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,"
"Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."
"Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:"
And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,"
"Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."
"When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
"And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born."
"And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,"
"And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel."
"Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared."
"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also."
"When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was."
"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy."
"And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh."
"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way."
"And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
"When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:"
"And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son."
"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men."
"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,"
"In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not."
"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"
"Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life."
"And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel."
"But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:"
"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene."
"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,"
"And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
"For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
"And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey."
"Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,"
"And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins."
"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
"And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
"And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:"
"Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him."
"But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?"
"And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him."
"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:"
"And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
"And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred."
"And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."
"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
"Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,"
"And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone."
"Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
"Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;"
"And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
"Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
"Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him."
"Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;"
"And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:"
"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,"
"The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;"
The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
"From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
"And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
"And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
"And they straightway left their nets, and followed him."
"And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them."
"And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him."
"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people."
"And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them."
"And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan."
"And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:"
"And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,"
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake."
"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you."
"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men."
Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
"Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house."
"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."
"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."
"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."
"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
"For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."
"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:"
"But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire."
"Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;"
"Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."
"Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison."
"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing."
"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:"
"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."
"And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell."
"And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell."
"It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:"
"But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery."
"Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:"
"But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:"
Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
"Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black."
"But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil."
"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:"
"But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."
"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also."
"And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain."
"Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away."
"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy."
"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;"
"That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."
"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?"
"And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?"
"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."
"Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven."
"Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."
"But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:"
That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
"And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."
"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."
"But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking."
"Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him."
"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name."
"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven."
Give us this day our daily bread.
"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."
"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen."
"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:"
"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."
"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;"
"That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly."
"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:"
"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:"
"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light."
"But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!"
"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?"
"Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?"
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:"
"And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
"Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?"
"Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?"
(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."
Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
"Judge not, that ye be not judged."
"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again."
"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
"Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?"
"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."
"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you."
"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:"
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
"Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?"
"Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?"
"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?"
"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets."
"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:"
"Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it."
"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."
"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."
"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven."
"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?"
"And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:"
"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock."
"And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:"
"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it."
"And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:"
"For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."
"When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him."
"And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
"And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed."
"And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
"And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,"
"And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented."
"And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him."
"The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed."
"For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it."
"When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
"And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven."
But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour."
"And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever."
"And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them."
"When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:"
"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses."
"Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side."
"And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."
"And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."
"And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."
"But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead."
"And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him."
"And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep."
"And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish."
"And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm."
"But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!"
"And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way."
"And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?"
And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.
"So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine."
"And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters."
"And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils."
"And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts."
"And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city."
"And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee."
"And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth."
"And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?"
"For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?"
"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house."
"And he arose, and departed to his house."
"But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men."
"And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him."
"And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples."
"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?"
"But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick."
"But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
"Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?"
"And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast."
"No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse."
"Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved."
"While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live."
"And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples."
"And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:"
"For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole."
"But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour."
"And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,"
"He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn."
"But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose."
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
"And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us."
"And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord."
"Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you."
"And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it."
"But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country."
"As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil."
"And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel."
"But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils."
"And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people."
"But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd."
"Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;"
"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."
"And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease."
"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;"
"Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;"
"Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him."
"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:"
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
"And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give."
"Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,"
"Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat."
"And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence."
"And when ye come into an house, salute it."
"And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you."
"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet."
"Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city."
"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."
"But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;"
"And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles."
"But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak."
"For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you."
"And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death."
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
"But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come."
"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord."
"It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?"
"Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known."
"What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops."
"And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
"Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows."
"Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven."
"But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven."
"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword."
"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."
And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.
He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me."
He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
"He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me."
He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
"And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward."
"And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities."
"Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,"
"And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
"Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:"
"The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them."
"And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me."
"And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
"But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses."
"But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet."
"For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
"Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force."
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come."
"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
"But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,"
"And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented."
"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil."
"The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children."
"Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:"
"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
"But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you."
"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day."
"But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee."
"At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes."
"Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight."
"All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him."
"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls."
"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
"At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat."
"But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day."
"But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;"
"How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?"
"Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?"
"But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple."
"But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless."
For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
"And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:"
"And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him."
"And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?"
How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
"Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other."
"Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him."
"But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;"
And charged them that they should not make him known:
"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,"
"Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles."
"He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets."
"A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory."
And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
"Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw."
"And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?"
"But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils."
"And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:"
"And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?"
"And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges."
"But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you."
"Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house."
He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
"Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men."
"And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come."
"Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit."
"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."
A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
"But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment."
"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."
"Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee."
"But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:"
For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here."
"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."
"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none."
"Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished."
"Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation."
"While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him."
"Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee."
"But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?"
"And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"
"For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."
"The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side."
"And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore."
"And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;"
"And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:"
"Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:"
"And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away."
"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:"
"But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold."
"Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
"And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?"
"He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."
"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath."
"Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."
"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:"
"For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear."
"For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them."
Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
"When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side."
"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;"
"Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended."
"He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful."
"But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."
"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:"
"But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way."
"But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also."
"So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?"
"He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?"
"But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them."
"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."
"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:"
"Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof."
"Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:
"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world."
"Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field."
"He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;"
The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;"
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:"
"Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:"
"Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away."
"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,"
And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
"Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord."
"Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old."
"And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence."
"And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?"
"Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?"
"And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?"
"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house."
And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,"
"And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him."
"For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife."
"For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her."
"And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet."
"But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod."
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.
"And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger."
"And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her."
"And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison."
"And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother."
"And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus."
"When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities."
"And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick."
"And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals."
"But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
"And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes."
"He said, Bring them hither to me."
"And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude."
"And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full."
"And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children."
"And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away."
"And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone."
"But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary."
"And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea."
"And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear."
"But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid."
"And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."
"And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus."
"But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me."
"And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"
"And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased."
"Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God."
"And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret."
"And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;"
And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
"Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,"
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
"But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?"
"For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death."
"But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;"
"And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition."
"Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,"
"This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me."
"But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."
"And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:"
"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man."
"Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?"
"But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up."
"Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch."
"Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable."
"And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?"
"Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?"
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
"For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:"
These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
"Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon."
"And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil."
"But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us."
"But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
"Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me."
"But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs."
"And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
"Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour."
"And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there."
"And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:"
"Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel."
"Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way."
"And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?"
"And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes."
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
"And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude."
"And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full."
"And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children."
"And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,"
"The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven."
"He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red."
"And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?"
"A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed."
"And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread."
"Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees."
"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread."
"Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?"
"Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
"Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
"How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?"
"Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees."
"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?"
"And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets."
"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?"
"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
"From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day."
"Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee."
"But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men."
"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."
"And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,"
"And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light."
"And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him."
"Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias."
"While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."
"And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid."
"And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid."
"And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only."
"And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead."
"And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?"
"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things."
"But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them."
Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
"And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,"
"Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water."
"And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him."
"Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me."
And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
"Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?"
"And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you."
Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
"And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:"
"And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry."
"And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?"
"He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?"
"Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free."
"Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee."
"At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
"And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,"
"And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea."
Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
"Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire."
"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire."
"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven."
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
"How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?"
"And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray."
"Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish."
"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother."
"But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established."
"And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican."
"Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
"Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven."
"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."
"Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?"
"Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."
"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants."
"And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents."
"But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made."
"The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt."
"But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest."
"And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
"And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt."
"So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done."
"Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:"
"Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?"
"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him."
"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."
"And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;"
And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
"The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?"
"And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,"
"And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?"
"Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."
"They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?"
"He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so."
"And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery."
"His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry."
"But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given."
"For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."
"Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them."
"But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
"And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence."
"And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
"And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."
"He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,"
"Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
"The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?"
"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me."
"But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions."
"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven."
"And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
"When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?"
"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible."
"Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?"
"And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
"For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard."
"And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard."
"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,"
"And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way."
"Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise."
"And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?"
"They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive."
"So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first."
"And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny."
"But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny."
"And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,"
"Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day."
"But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?"
"Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee."
"Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?"
"So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen."
"And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,"
"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,"
"And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again."
"Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him."
"And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom."
"But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able."
"And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father."
"And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren."
"But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them."
"But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;"
"And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:"
"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
"And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him."
"And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David."
"And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David."
"And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?"
"They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
"So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him."
"And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,"
"Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me."
"And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them."
"All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,"
"Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass."
"And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,"
"And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon."
"And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way."
"And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest."
"And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?"
"And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee."
"And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,"
"And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
"And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,"
"And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"
"And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there."
"Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered."
"And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away."
"And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!"
"Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done."
"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."
"And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?"
"And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?"
"But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet."
"And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."
"But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard."
"He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went."
"And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not."
"Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you."
"For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him."
"Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:"
"And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it."
"And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another."
"Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise."
"But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son."
"But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance."
"And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him."
"When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?"
"They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons."
"Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"
"Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof."
"And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
"And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them."
"But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet."
"And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,"
"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,"
And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
"Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage."
"But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:"
"And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them."
"But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city."
"Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy."
"Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage."
"So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests."
"And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:"
"And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless."
"Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"For many are called, but few are chosen."
"Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk."
"And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men."
"Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?"
"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?"
Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.
"And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?"
"They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
"When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way."
"The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,"
"Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
"Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:"
"Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh."
And last of all the woman died also.
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
"Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God."
"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven."
"But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,"
"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
"And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine."
"But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together."
"Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,"
"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?"
"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind."
This is the first and great commandment.
"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,"
"Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David."
"He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,"
"The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
"If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?"
"And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions."
"Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,"
"Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:"
"All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not."
"For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers."
"But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,"
"And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,"
"And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi."
"But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren."
"And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven."
"Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ."
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
"But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in."
"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation."
"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves."
"Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!"
"Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?"
"And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty."
"Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?"
"Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon."
"And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein."
"And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon."
"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
"Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel."
"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess."
"Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also."
"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness."
"Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."
"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,"
"And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets."
"Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets."
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
"Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?"
"Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:"
"That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar."
"Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation."
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"
"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate."
"For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
"And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple."
"And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
"And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?"
"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you."
"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many."
"And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet."
"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places."
All these are the beginning of sorrows.
"Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake."
"And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another."
"And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many."
"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."
"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:
Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.
"And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!"
"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:"
"For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be."
"And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened."
"Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not."
"For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect."
"Behold, I have told you before."
"Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not."
"For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
"For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together."
"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:"
"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."
"And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."
"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:"
"So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors."
"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled."
"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."
"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."
"But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
"For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,"
"And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
"Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
"Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
"But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up."
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
"Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?"
"Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing."
"Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods."
"But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;"
"And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;"
"The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,"
"And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom."
"And five of them were wise, and five were foolish."
"They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:"
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
"While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept."
"And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him."
"Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps."
"And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out."
"But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves."
"And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut."
"Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us."
"But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not."
"Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh."
"For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods."
"And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey."
"Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents."
"And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two."
"But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money."
"After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them."
"And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more."
"His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."
"He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them."
"His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."
"Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:"
"And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine."
"His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:"
"Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury."
"Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents."
"For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath."
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:"
"And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:"
"And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left."
"Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:"
"For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:"
"Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me."
"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?"
"When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?"
"Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?"
"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."
"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:"
"For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:"
"I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not."
"Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?"
"Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me."
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,"
"Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified."
"Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,"
"And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him."
"But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people."
"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,"
"There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat."
"But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?"
"For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
"When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me."
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
"For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial."
"Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her."
"Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,"
"And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver."
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
"Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?"
"And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples."
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
"Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve."
"And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."
"And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?"
"And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me."
The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
"Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said."
"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body."
"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;"
"For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins."
"But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives."
"Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad."
"But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee."
"Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended."
"Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
"Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples."
"Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder."
"And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy."
"Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me."
"And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."
"And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?"
"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
"He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done."
And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
"And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."
"Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me."
"And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people."
"Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast."
"And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him."
"And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him."
"And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear."
"Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."
"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?"
"But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?"
"In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me."
"But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled."
"And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled."
"But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end."
"Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;"
"But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,"
"And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days."
"And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?"
"But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God."
"Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
"Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy."
"What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death."
"Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,"
"Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?"
"Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee."
"But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest."
"And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth."
"And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man."
"And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee."
"Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew."
"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly."
"When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:"
"And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor."
"Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
"Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that."
"And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself."
"And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in."
"Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day."
"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;"
"And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me."
"And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest."
"And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."
"Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?"
And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
"Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would."
"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas."
"Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?"
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
"When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus."
"The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas."
"Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified."
"And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified."
"When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it."
"Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children."
"Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified."
"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers."
"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe."
"And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!"
"And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head."
"And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him."
"And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross."
"And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,"
"They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink."
"And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots."
And sitting down they watched him there;
"And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
"Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left."
"And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,"
"And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross."
"Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,"
"He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him."
"He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God."
"The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth."
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
"Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias."
"And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink."
"The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him."
"Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost."
"And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;"
"And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,"
"And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many."
"Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
"And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:"
"Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children."
"When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:"
"He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered."
"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
"And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed."
"And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre."
"Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,"
"Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again."
"Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first."
"Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can."
"So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch."
"In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre."
"And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it."
"His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:"
"And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men."
"And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified."
"He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
"And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you."
And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
"And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him."
"Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me."
"Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done."
"And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,"
"Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept."
"And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you."
"So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day."
"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them."
"And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted."
"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:"
"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen."
"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;"
"As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
"John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."
"And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins."
"And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;"
"And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose."
I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan."
"And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:"
"And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
"And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him."
"Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,"
"And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel."
"Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
"And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men."
"And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him."
"And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets."
"And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him."
"And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught."
"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes."
"And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,"
"Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God."
"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him."
"And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him."
"And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him."
And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
"And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
"But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her."
"And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them."
"And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils."
And all the city was gathered together at the door.
"And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him."
"And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."
And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
"And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee."
"And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth."
"And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils."
"And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
"And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean."
"And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed."
"And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;"
"And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
"But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter."
"And again he entered into Capernaum, after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house."
"And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them."
"And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four."
"And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay."
"When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee."
"But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,"
Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
"And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?"
"Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?"
"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)"
"I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house."
"And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion."
"And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them."
"And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him."
"And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him."
"And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?"
"When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
"And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?"
"And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
"No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse."
"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles."
"And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn."
"And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?"
"And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?"
"How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?"
"And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:"
Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
"And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him."
"And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth."
"And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace."
"And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other."
"And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him."
"But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,"
"And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him."
"And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him."
"For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues."
"And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God."
And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
"And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him."
"And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,"
"And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:"
And Simon he surnamed Peter;
"And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:"
"And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,"
"And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house."
"And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread."
"And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself."
"And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils."
"And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?"
"And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
"And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand."
"And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end."
"No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house."
"Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:"
"But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:"
"Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit."
"There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him."
"And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee."
"And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?"
"And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"
"For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."
"And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land."
"And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,"
"Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:"
"And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up."
"And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:"
"But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."
"And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred."
"And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
"And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable."
"And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:"
"That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them."
"And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?"
The sower soweth the word.
"And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts."
"And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;"
"And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended."
"And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,"
"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful."
"And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred."
"And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?"
"For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad."
"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
"And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given."
"For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath."
"And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;"
"And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how."
"For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear."
"But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come."
"And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?"
"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:"
"But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it."
"And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it."
"But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples."
"And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side."
"And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships."
"And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full."
"And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?"
"And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
"And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?"
"And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
"And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes."
"And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,"
"Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:"
"Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him."
"And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones."
"But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,"
"And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not."
"For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit."
"And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many."
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
"And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."
"And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea."
"And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done."
"And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
"And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine."
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
"And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him."
"Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."
"And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel."
"And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea."
"And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,"
"And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live."
"And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him."
"And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,"
"And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,"
"When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment."
"For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole."
And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
"And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?"
"And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
"And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague."
"While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?"
"As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe."
"And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James."
"And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly."
"And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth."
"And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying."
"And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise."
"And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment."
And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
"And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him."
"And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?"
"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him."
"But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house."
"And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them."
"And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching."
"And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;"
"And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:"
But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
"And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place."
"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city."
"And they went out, and preached that men should repent."
"And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them."
"And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him."
"Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets."
"But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead."
"For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her."
"For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife."
"Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:"
"For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."
"And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;"
"And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee."
"And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom."
"And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."
"And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist."
"And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her."
"And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
"And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother."
"And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb."
"And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught."
"And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat."
And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
"And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him."
"And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things."
"And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:"
"Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat."
"He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?"
"He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes."
And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties."
"And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all."
"And they did all eat, and were filled."
"And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes."
And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
"And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people."
"And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray."
"And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land."
"And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them."
"But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:"
"For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid."
"And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered."
For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
"And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore."
"And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,"
"And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was."
"And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
"Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem."
"And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault."
"For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders."
"And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables."
"Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?"
"He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."
"Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctines the commandments of men."
"For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do."
"And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition."
"For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:"
"But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free."
And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
"Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye."
"And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:"
"There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man."
"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
"And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable."
"And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;"
"Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?"
"And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man."
"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,"
"Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:"
"All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
"And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid."
"For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:"
"The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter."
"But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs."
"And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs."
"And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter."
"And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed."
"And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis."
"And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him."
"And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;"
"And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened."
"And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain."
"And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;"
"And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."
"In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,"
"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:"
"And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far."
"And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?"
"And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven."
"And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people."
"And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them."
"So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets."
And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
"And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha."
"And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him."
"And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation."
"And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side."
"Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf."
"And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod."
"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread."
"And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?"
"Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?"
"When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve."
"And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven."
"And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?"
"And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him."
"And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought."
"And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking."
"After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly."
"And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town."
"And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?"
"And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets."
"And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ."
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
"And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
"And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him."
"But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men."
"And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it."
"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
"Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
"And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power."
"And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them."
"And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them."
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
"And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias."
For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
"And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
"And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves."
"And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead."
"And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean."
"And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?"
"And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought."
"But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him."
"And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them."
"And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him."
"And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?"
"And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;"
"And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not."
"He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me."
"And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming."
"And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child."
"And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us."
"Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth."
"And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."
"When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him."
"And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead."
"But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose."
"And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?"
"And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting."
"And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it."
"For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day."
"But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him."
"And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?"
"But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest."
"And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all."
"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,"
"Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me."
"And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us."
"But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me."
For he that is not against us is on our part.
"For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward."
"And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea."
"And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
"And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:"
"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
"For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt."
"Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another."
"And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again."
"And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him."
"And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?"
"And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away."
"And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept."
But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;"
"And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh."
"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."
And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
"And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her."
"And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery."
"And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them."
"But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God."
"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein."
"And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them."
"And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God."
"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother."
"And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth."
"Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me."
"And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions."
"And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"
"And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
"And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?"
"And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible."
"Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee."
"And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,"
"But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
"And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,"
"Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:"
"And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again."
"And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire."
"And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?"
"They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory."
"But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
"And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:"
But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
"And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John."
"But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them."
"But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:"
"And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all."
"For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
"And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging."
"And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me."
"And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me."
"And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee."
"And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus."
"And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight."
"And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way."
"And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,"
"And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him."
"And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither."
"And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him."
"And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?"
And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
"And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him."
"And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way."
"And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:"
"Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest."
"And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve."
"And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:"
"And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet."
"And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it."
"And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;"
And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.
"And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves."
"And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine."
"And when even was come, he went out of the city."
"And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots."
"And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away."
"And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God."
"For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith."
"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them."
"And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."
"But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses."
"And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,"
"And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?"
"And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me."
"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?"
"But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed."
"And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
"And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country."
"And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard."
"And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty."
"And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled."
"And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some."
"Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son."
"But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours."
"And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard."
"What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others."
And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
"This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"
"And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way."
"And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words."
"And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"
"Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it."
"And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's."
"And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him."
"Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,"
"Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
"Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed."
"And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise."
"And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also."
"In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife."
"And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?"
"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven."
"And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?"
"He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err."
"And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?"
"And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:"
"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment."
"And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."
"And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:"
"And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question."
"And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?"
"For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
"And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,"
"And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:"
"Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation."
"And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much."
"And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing."
"And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:"
"For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living."
"And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!"
"And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
"And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,"
"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?"
"And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:"
"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many."
"And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet."
"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows."
"But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them."
And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
"But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost."
"Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death."
"And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."
"But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:"
"And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:"
And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
"But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!"
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
"For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be."
"And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days."
"And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:"
"For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect."
"But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things."
"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,"
"And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken."
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
"And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven."
"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:"
"So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors."
"Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done."
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
"But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."
"Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is."
"For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch."
"Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:"
Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
"And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch."
"After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death."
"But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people."
"And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head."
"And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?"
"For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her."
"And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me."
"For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always."
She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
"Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her."
"And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them."
"And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him."
"And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?"
"And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him."
"And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?"
And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.
"And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover."
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
"And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me."
"And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?"
"And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish."
"The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born."
"And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body."
"And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it."
"And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many."
"Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives."
"And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered."
"But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee."
"But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I."
"And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice."
"But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all."
"And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray."
"And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;"
"And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch."
"And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him."
"And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt."
"And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?"
"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak."
"And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words."
"And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him."
"And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand."
"And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
"And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely."
"And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him."
"And they laid their hands on him, and took him."
"And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?"
"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled."
"And they all forsook him, and fled."
"And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:"
"And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked."
And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
"And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire."
And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
"For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together."
"And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,"
"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands."
But neither so did their witness agree together.
"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?"
"But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
"And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
"Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?"
Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands."
"And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:"
"And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth."
"But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew."
"And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them."
"And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto."
"But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak."
"And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept."
"And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate."
"And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it."
And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
"And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee."
But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
"Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired."
"And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection."
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.
"But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
"But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them."
"And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?"
"And they cried out again, Crucify him."
"Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him."
"And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified."
"And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band."
"And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,"
"And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!"
"And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him."
"And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him."
"And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross."
"And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull."
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
"And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take."
"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him."
"And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
"And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left."
"And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors."
"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,"
"Save thyself, and come down from the cross."
"Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save."
"Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him."
"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
"And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias."
"And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down."
"And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost."
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
"And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God."
"There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;"
"(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem."
"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,"
"Joseph of Arimathaea, and honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus."
"And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead."
"And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph."
"And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre."
And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him."
"And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun."
"And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?"
"And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great."
"And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted."
"And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him."
"But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you."
"And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid."
"Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils."
"And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept."
"And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not."
"After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country."
And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.
"And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
"They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
"So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God."
"And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen."
"Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,"
"Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;"
"It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,"
"That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed."
"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth."
"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."
"And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years."
"And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,"
"According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord."
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
"And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him."
"But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John."
And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb."
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
"And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
"And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years."
"And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings."
"And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season."
"And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple."
"And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless."
"And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house."
"And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,"
"Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men."
"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,"
"To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary."
"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women."
"And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be."
"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God."
"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS."
"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:"
And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
"And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren."
For with God nothing shall be impossible.
"And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her."
"And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;"
"And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth."
"And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:"
"And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb."
"And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
"For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy."
And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
"And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,"
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
"For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed."
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.
And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.
He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
"He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree."
He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.
"He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;"
"As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever."
"And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house."
Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
"And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father."
"And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John."
"And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name."
"And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called."
"And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all."
"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God."
And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
"And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him."
"And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,"
"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,"
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;
"As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:"
"That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;"
"To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;"
"The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,"
"That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,"
"In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life."
"And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;"
"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,"
"Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,"
"To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."
"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel."
"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed."
(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
"And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city."
"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)"
"To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child."
"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered."
"And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."
"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night."
"And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid."
"And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."
"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord."
"And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."
"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,"
"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
"And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us."
"And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."
"And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child."
And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
"But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart."
"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them."
"And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
"And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;"
"(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)"
"And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
"And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him."
"And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ."
"And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,"
"Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,"
"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:"
"For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,"
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
"A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel."
And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.
"And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;"
"(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
"And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;"
"And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day."
"And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem."
"And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth."
"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him."
Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
"And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast."
"And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it."
"But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance."
"And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him."
"And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions."
And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
"And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing."
"And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?"
And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
"And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart."
"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."
"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,"
"Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness."
"And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;"
"As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
"Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;"
And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
"Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
"And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
"And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?"
"He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise."
"Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?"
"And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you."
"And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages."
"And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;"
"John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:"
"Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.
"But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,"
"Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison."
"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,"
"And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased."
"And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,"
"Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph,"
"Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge,"
"Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Juda,"
"Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri,"
"Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er,"
"Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi,"
"Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim,"
"Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David,"
"Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of Naasson,"
"Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda,"
"Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor,"
"Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala,"
"Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech,"
"Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of Cainan,"
"Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God."
"And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,"
"Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered."
"And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread."
"And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God."
"And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time."
"And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it."
"If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine."
"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
"And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:"
"For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:"
"And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone."
"And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
"And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season."
And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.
"And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all."
"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read."
"And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,"
"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,"
To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
"And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him."
"And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
"And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?"
"And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country."
"And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country."
"But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;"
"But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow."
"And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian."
"And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,"
"And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong."
"But he passing through the midst of them went his way,"
"And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days."
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
"And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,"
"Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God."
"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not."
"And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out."
And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
"And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her."
"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them."
"Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them."
"And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ."
"And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them."
"And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent."
And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
"And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,"
"And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets."
"And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship."
"Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught."
"And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net."
"And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake."
"And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink."
"When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
"For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:"
"And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men."
"And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him."
"And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
"And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him."
"And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
"But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities."
"And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed."
"And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them."
"And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him."
"And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus."
"And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee."
"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
"But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?"
"Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?"
"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house."
"And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God."
"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day."
"And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me."
"And he left all, rose up, and followed him."
And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.
"But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?"
"And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick."
"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
"And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?"
"And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?"
"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
"And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old."
"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish."
But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.
"No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better."
"And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands."
"And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?"
"And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;"
"How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?"
"And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
"And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered."
"And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him."
"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth."
"Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?"
"And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other."
And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
"And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."
"And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;"
"Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,"
"Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,"
"And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor."
"And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;"
And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
"And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all."
"And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God."
Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake."
"Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets."
But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets."
"But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,"
"Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you."
And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also.
Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.
"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise."
"For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them."
"And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same."
"And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again."
"But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil."
"Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."
"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:"
"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."
"And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?"
The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.
"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
"Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye."
For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
"For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes."
A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"
"Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:"
"He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock."
"But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great."
"Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum."
"And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die."
"And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant."
"And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:"
"For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue."
"Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:"
"Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed."
"For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it."
"When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
"And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick."
"And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people."
"Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her."
"And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not."
"And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise."
"And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother."
"And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people."
"And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about."
And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
"And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"
"When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"
"And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight."
"Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached."
"And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me."
"And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
"But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts."
"But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet."
"This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
"For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
"And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John."
"But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him."
"And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?"
"They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept."
"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil."
"The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!"
But wisdom is justified of all her children.
"And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat."
"And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,"
"And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment."
"Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner."
"And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on."
"There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty."
"And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?"
"Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged."
"And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head."
Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.
"Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little."
"And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven."
"And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?"
"And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace."
"And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,"
"And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,"
"And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance."
"And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:"
"A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it."
"And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture."
"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it."
"And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
"And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?"
"And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand."
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
"Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved."
"They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away."
"And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection."
"But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience."
"No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light."
"For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad."
"Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have."
"Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press."
"And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee."
"And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it."
"Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth."
"But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy."
"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm."
"And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him."
"And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee."
"And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs."
"When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not."
"(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)"
"And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him."
And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.
"Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked."
"When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country."
"Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.
"Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again."
"Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,"
"Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him."
"And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him."
"And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:"
"For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him."
"And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,"
"Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched."
"And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"
"And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me."
"And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately."
"And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."
"While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master."
"But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole."
"And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden."
"And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth."
"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead."
"And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise."
"And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat."
And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
"Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases."
"And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick."
"And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece."
"And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart."
"And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
"And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where."
"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;"
"And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again."
"And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him."
"And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida."
"And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing."
"And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place."
"But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people."
"For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company."
"And they did so, and made them all sit down."
"Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude."
"And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets."
"And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?"
"They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again."
"He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God."
"And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;"
"Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day."
"And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me."
"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it."
"For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?"
"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels."
"But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God."
"And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray."
"And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering."
"And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:"
"Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem."
"But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him."
"And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said."
"While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud."
"And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
"And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen."
"And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him."
"And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child."
"And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him."
And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
"And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither."
"And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father."
"And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,"
Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
"But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying."
"Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest."
"And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,"
"And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great."
"And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us."
"And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us."
"And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,"
"And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him."
"And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem."
"And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?"
"But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of."
"For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village."
"And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."
"And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."
"And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."
"Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God."
"And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house."
"And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."
"After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come."
"Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest."
"Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves."
"Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way."
"And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house."
"And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again."
"And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house."
"And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:"
"And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."
"But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,"
"Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."
"But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city."
"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
"But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you."
"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell."
He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.
"And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."
"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."
"Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you."
"Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven."
"In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight."
"All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him."
"And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:"
"For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them."
"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
"He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?"
"And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself."
"And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live."
"But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?"
"And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead."
"And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
"And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side."
"But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,"
"And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him."
"And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee."
"Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?"
"And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise."
"Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house."
"And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word."
"But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me."
"And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:"
"But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."
"And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples."
"And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth."
Give us day by day our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
"And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;"
"For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?"
"And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee."
"I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth."
"And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
"If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?"
"Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?"
"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"
"And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered."
"But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils."
"And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven."
"But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth."
"If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub."
"And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges."
"But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you."
"When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:"
"But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils."
He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out."
"And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished."
"Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first."
"And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked."
"But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it."
"And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet."
"For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation."
"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."
"The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here."
"No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light."
"The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness."
Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.
"If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light."
"And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat."
"And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner."
"And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness."
"Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?"
"But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you."
"But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
"Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets."
"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them."
"Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also."
"And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers."
"Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them."
"Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres."
"Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:"
"That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;"
"From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation."
"Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered."
"And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:"
"Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him."
"In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
"For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known."
Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
"And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."
"But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him."
"Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?"
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
"Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:"
But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.
"And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven."
"And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:"
For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
"And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me."
"And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?"
"And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."
"And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:"
"And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?"
"And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods."
"And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry."
"But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?"
"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."
"And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on."
"The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment."
Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?
And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
"If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?"
"Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
"If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?"
"And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind."
For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.
"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth."
"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
"Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;"
"And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately."
"Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them."
"And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants."
"And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through."
Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.
"Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?"
"And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?"
"Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing."
"Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath."
"But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;"
"The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers."
"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."
"But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more."
I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?
But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:"
"For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three."
"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."
"And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is."
"And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass."
"Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?"
"Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?"
"When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison."
"I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite."
"There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices."
"And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?"
"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
"Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?"
"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
"He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none."
"Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?"
"And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:"
"And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down."
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
"And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself."
"And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity."
"And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God."
"And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day."
"The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?"
"And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?"
"And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him."
"Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?"
"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it."
"And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?"
"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
"And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem."
"Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,"
"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able."
"When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:"
"Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets."
"But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity."
"There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out."
"And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God."
"And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last."
"The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee."
"And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected."
"Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem."
"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!"
"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
"And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him."
"And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy."
"And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?"
"And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;"
"And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?"
And they could not answer him again to these things.
"And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,"
"When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;"
"And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room."
"But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee."
For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
"Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee."
"But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:"
And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
"And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God."
"Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:"
"And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready."
"And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused."
"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused."
"And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."
"So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind."
"And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room."
"And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled."
"For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper."
"And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,"
"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."
"And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple."
"For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?"
"Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,"
"Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish."
"Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?"
"Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace."
"So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."
"Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?"
"It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.
"And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them."
"And he spake this parable unto them, saying,"
"What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?"
"And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
"And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost."
"I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance."
"Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?"
"And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost."
"Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth."
"And he said, A certain man had two sons:"
"And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living."
"And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living."
"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want."
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
"And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!"
"I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,"
And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."
"And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son."
"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:"
"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry."
"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing."
"And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant."
"And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound."
"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him."
"And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:"
"But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf."
"And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."
"It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."
"And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods."
"And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward."
"Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed."
"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses."
"So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?"
"And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty."
"Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore."
"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."
"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."
He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?"
"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?"
"No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
"And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him."
"And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."
"The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it."
"And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery."
"There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"
And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"
"And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."
"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."
"And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence."
"Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:"
"For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment."
"Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."
"And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent."
"And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
"Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!"
"It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones."
"Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him."
"And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him."
"And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith."
"And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you."
"But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?"
"And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?"
Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
"So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do."
"And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee."
"And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:"
"And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us."
"And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed."
"And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,"
"And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan."
"And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?"
"There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger."
"And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole."
"And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:"
"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you."
"And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it."
"And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them."
"For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day."
"But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation."
"And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man."
"They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all."
"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;"
"But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all."
Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
"In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back."
Remember Lot's wife.
Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
"I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left."
"Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
"Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
"And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together."
"And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;"
"Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:"
"And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary."
"And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;"
"Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me."
"And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith."
"And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?"
"I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?"
"And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:"
"Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican."
"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican."
"I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess."
"And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner."
"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
"And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them."
"But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God."
"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein."
"And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God."
"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother."
"And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up."
"Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me."
"And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich."
"And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"
"For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
"And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?"
"And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
"Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee."
"And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,"
"Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting."
"Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished."
"For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:"
"And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again."
"And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken."
"And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:"
"And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant."
"And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."
"And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me."
"And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me."
"And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,"
"Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight."
"And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee."
"And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God."
And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
"And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich."
"And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature."
"And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way."
"And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house."
"And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully."
"And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner."
"And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold."
"And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham."
For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
"And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear."
"He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."
"And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come."
"But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us."
"And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading."
"Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds."
"And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities."
"And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds."
"And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities."
"And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:"
"For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow."
"And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:"
"Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?"
"And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds."
"(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)"
"For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him."
"But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me."
"And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem."
"And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,"
"Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither."
"And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him."
"And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them."
"And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?"
"And they said, The Lord hath need of him."
"And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon."
"And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way."
"And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;"
"Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."
"And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples."
"And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out."
"And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,"
"Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes."
"For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,"
"And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation."
"And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;"
"Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves."
"And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,"
And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
"And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,"
"And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?"
"And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:"
"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?"
"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?"
"But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet."
"And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was."
"And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."
"Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time."
"And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty."
"And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty."
"And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out."
"Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him."
"But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours."
"So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?"
"He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid."
"And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?"
"Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
"And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor."
"And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:"
"Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?"
"But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?"
"Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's."
"And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's."
"And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace."
"Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,"
"Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
"There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children."
"And the second took her to wife, and he died childless."
"And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died."
Last of all the woman died also.
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
"And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:"
"But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:"
"Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."
"Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
"For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him."
"Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said."
And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
"And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?"
"And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"
Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
"David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?"
"Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,"
"Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;"
"Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation."
"And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury."
And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
"And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:"
For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
"And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,"
"As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
"And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?"
"And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them."
"But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by."
"Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:"
"And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven."
"But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake."
And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
"Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:"
"For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist."
"And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death."
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.
But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
In your patience possess ye your souls.
"And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh."
Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
"For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled."
"But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people."
"And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled."
"And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;"
"Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken."
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."
"And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;"
"When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand."
"So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand."
"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled."
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares."
For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."
"And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives."
"And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him."
"Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover."
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
"Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve."
"And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them."
"And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money."
"And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude."
"Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed."
"And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat."
"And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?"
"And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in."
"And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?"
And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
"And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover."
"And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him."
"And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:"
"For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:"
"For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come."
"And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me."
"Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you."
"But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table."
"And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!"
"And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing."
"And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest."
"And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors."
"But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve."
"For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth."
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
"And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;"
"That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:"
"But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."
"And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death."
"And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me."
"And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing."
"Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one."
"For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end."
"And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough."
"And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him."
"And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation."
"And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,"
"Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."
"And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him."
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
"And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,"
"And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation."
"And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him."
"But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?"
"When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?"
"And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear."
"And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him."
"Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?"
"When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
"Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off."
"And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them."
"But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him."
"And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not."
"And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not."
"And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean."
"And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew."
"And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
"And Peter went out, and wept bitterly."
"And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him."
"And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?"
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
"And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,"
"Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:"
"And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go."
Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
"Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am."
"And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth."
"And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate."
"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King."
"And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it."
"Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man."
"And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place."
"When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean."
"And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time."
"And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him."
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
"And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate."
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
"And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
"Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:"
"No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him."
"I will therefore chastise him, and release him."
(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
"And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:"
"(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)"
"Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them."
"But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him."
"And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go."
"And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed."
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
"And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will."
"And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus."
"And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him."
"But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children."
"For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck."
"Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us."
"For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?"
"And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death."
"And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left."
"Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots."
"And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God."
"And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,"
"And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself."
"And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
"And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us."
"But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?"
And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
"And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."
"And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise."
"And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour."
"And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst."
"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."
"Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man."
"And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned."
"And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things."
"And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counseller; and he was a good man, and a just:"
"(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God."
"This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus."
"And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid."
"And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on."
"And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid."
"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment."
"Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them."
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
"And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus."
"And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:"
"And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?"
"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,"
"Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again."
"And they remembered his words,"
"And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest."
"It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles."
"And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not."
"Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass."
"And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs."
And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
"And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them."
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
"And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?"
"And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days?"
"And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:"
"And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him."
"But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done."
"Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;"
"And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive."
"And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not."
"Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:"
"Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?"
"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself."
"And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further."
"But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them."
"And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them."
"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight."
"And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?"
"And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,"
"Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon."
"And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread."
"And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."
"But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit."
"And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?"
"Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have."
"And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet."
"And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?"
"And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb."
"And he took it, and did eat before them."
"And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me."
"Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,"
"And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:"
"And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."
And ye are witnesses of these things.
"And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high."
"And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them."
"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven."
"And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:"
"And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen."
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John."
"The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe."
"He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light."
"That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world."
"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not."
"He came unto his own, and his own received him not."
"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:"
"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
"John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."
"And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace."
"For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him."
"And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?"
"And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ."
"And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No."
"Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?"
"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias."
And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
"And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?"
"John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;"
"He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose."
"These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing."
"The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."
"This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me."
"And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water."
"And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him."
"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
"And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God."
"Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;"
"And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!"
"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
"Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?"
"He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour."
"One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother."
"He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ."
"And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone."
"The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me."
"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
"Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
"And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see."
"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"
"Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee."
"Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel."
"Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these."
"And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."
And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
"And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage."
"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine."
"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come."
"His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it."
"And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece."
"Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim."
"And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it."
"When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,"
"And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now."
"This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
"After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days."
"And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,"
"And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:"
"And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;"
"And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise."
"And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up."
"Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?"
"Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
"Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?"
But he spake of the temple of his body.
"When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."
"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did."
"But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,"
And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
"There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:"
"The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him."
"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
"Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"
"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
"Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again."
"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit."
"Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?"
"Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?"
"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness."
"If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?"
"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven."
"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:"
"That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life."
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
"He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."
"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."
"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."
"But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."
"After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized."
"And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized."
For John was not yet cast into prison.
Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
"And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him."
"John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven."
"Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him."
"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled."
"He must increase, but I must decrease."
"He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all."
"And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony."
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand."
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
"When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,"
"(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)"
"He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee."
And he must needs go through Samaria.
"Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph."
"Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour."
"There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink."
(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
"Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans."
"Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water."
"The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?"
"Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?"
"Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:"
But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
"The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw."
"Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither."
"The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:"
For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
"The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet."
"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father."
Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
"But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him."
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
"The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things."
"Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he."
"And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?"
"The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,"
"Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?"
"Then they went out of the city, and came unto him."
"In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat."
"But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of."
"Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?"
"Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work."
"Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest."
"And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together."
"And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth."
"I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours."
"And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did."
"So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days."
And many more believed because of his own word;
"And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world."
"Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee."
"For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country."
"Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast."
"So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum."
"When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death."
"Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe."
"The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die."
"Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way."
"And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth."
"Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
"So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house."
"This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee."
After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
"Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches."
"In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water."
"For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had."
"And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years."
"When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?"
"The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me."
"Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk."
"And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath."
"The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed."
"He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk."
"Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?"
"And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place."
"Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."
"The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole."
"And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day."
"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work."
"Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God."
"Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise."
"For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel."
"For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will."
"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:"
"That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live."
For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
"And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man."
"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,"
"And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."
"I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me."
"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true."
There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
"Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth."
"But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved."
He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
"But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me."
"And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape."
"And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not."
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
"And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."
I receive not honour from men.
"But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you."
"I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive."
"How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?"
"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust."
"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me."
"But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?"
"After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias."
"And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased."
"And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples."
"And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh."
"When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?"
And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
"Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little."
"One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,"
"There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?"
"And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."
"And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would."
"When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost."
"Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten."
"Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world."
"When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone."
"And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,"
"And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them."
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
"So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid."
"But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid."
Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
"The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;"
"(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)"
"When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus."
"And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?"
"Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled."
"Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed."
"Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?"
"Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent."
"They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?"
"Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat."
"Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven."
"For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world."
"Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread."
"And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst."
"But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not."
All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
"For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me."
"And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day."
"And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day."
"The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven."
"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?"
"Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves."
"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day."
"It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me."
"Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life."
I am that bread of life.
"Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead."
"This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die."
"I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
"The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
"Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you."
"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
"For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."
"He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him."
"As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me."
"This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever."
"These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum."
"Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?"
"When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?"
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."
"But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him."
"And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father."
"From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him."
"Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?"
"Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life."
"And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God."
"Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
"He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve."
"After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him."
Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
"His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest."
"For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world."
For neither did his brethren believe in him.
"Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready."
"The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil."
Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.
"When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee."
"But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret."
"Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?"
"And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people."
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
"Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught."
"And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?"
"Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me."
"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself."
"He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him."
"Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?"
"The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?"
"Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel."
"Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man."
"If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?"
"Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
"Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?"
"But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?"
"Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is."
"Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not."
"But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me."
"Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come."
"And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?"
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
"Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me."
"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come."
"Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?"
"What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?"
"In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."
"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."
"(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)"
"Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet."
"Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?"
"Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?"
So there was a division among the people because of him.
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
"Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?"
"The officers answered, Never man spake like this man."
"Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?"
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
"Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)"
"Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?"
"They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet."
And every man went unto his own house.
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
"And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them."
"And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,"
"They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act."
"Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?"
"This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not."
"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."
"And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground."
"And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst."
"When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?"
"She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."
"Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
"The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true."
"Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go."
Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
"And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me."
"It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true."
"I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me."
"Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also."
"These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come."
"Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come."
"Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come."
"And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world."
"I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins."
"Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning."
I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
"Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things."
And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
"As he spake these words, many believed on him."
"Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;"
"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
"They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?"
"Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin."
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.
"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."
"I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you."
I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
"They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham."
"But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham."
"Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God."
"Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me."
Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.
"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it."
"And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not."
"Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?"
"He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God."
"Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?"
"Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me."
And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death."
"Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death."
"Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?"
"Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:"
"Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying."
"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad."
"Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?"
"Jesus said unto them, Verily,verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am."
"Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by."
"And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth."
"And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"
"Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him."
"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work."
"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
"When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,"
"And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing."
"The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?"
"Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he."
"Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?"
"He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight."
"Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not."
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
"And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes."
"Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see."
"Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them."
"They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet."
"But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight."
"And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?"
"His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:"
"But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself."
"These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue."
"Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him."
"Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner."
"He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."
"Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?"
"He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?"
"Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples."
"We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is."
"The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes."
"Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth."
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
"If this man were not of God, he could do nothing."
"They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out."
"Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?"
"He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?"
"And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee."
"And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him."
"And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind."
"And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?"
"Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber."
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
"To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out."
"And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice."
"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers."
This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
"Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep."
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
"I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture."
"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."
I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
"But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep."
"The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep."
"I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine."
"As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep."
"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd."
"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again."
"No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father."
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
"And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?"
"Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?"
"And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter."
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
"Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly."
"Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me."
"But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you."
"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:"
"And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand."
"My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand."
I and my Father are one.
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
"Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?"
"The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God."
"Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?"
"If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;"
"Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?"
"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not."
"But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him."
"Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,"
And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
"And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true."
And many believed on him there.
"Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha."
"(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)"
"Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick."
"When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby."
"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus."
"When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was."
"Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again."
"His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?"
"Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world."
"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him."
"These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."
"Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well."
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
"Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead."
"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him."
"Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him."
"Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already."
"Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:"
"And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother."
"Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house."
"Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
"But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee."
"Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again."
"Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:"
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
"She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world."
"And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee."
"As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him."
"Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him."
"The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there."
"Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,"
"And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see."
Jesus wept.
"Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!"
"And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"
"Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it."
"Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days."
"Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?"
"Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me."
"And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me."
"And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth."
"And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go."
"Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him."
"But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done."
"Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles."
"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation."
"And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,"
"Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."
"And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;"
"And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad."
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples."
"And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves."
"Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?"
"Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him."
"Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead."
There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
"Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment."
"Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,"
"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?"
"This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein."
"Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this."
For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
"Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead."
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
"Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus."
"On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
"Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord."
"And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,"
"Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt."
"These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him."
"The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record."
"For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle."
"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him."
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
"The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus."
Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
"And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
"If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour."
"Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour."
"Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
"The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him."
"Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes."
Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."
"This he said, signifying what death he should die."
"The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?"
"Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth."
"While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them."
"But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:"
"That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
"Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,"
"He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them."
"These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him."
"Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:"
For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
"Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me."
And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
"I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness."
"And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."
"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."
"For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."
"And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak."
"Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end."
"And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;"
"Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;"
"He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself."
"After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded."
"Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?"
"Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter."
"Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."
"Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."
"Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all."
"For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean."
"So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?"
Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
"If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet."
"For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him."
"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."
"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me."
"Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me."
"When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."
"Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake."
"Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved."
"Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake."
"He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?"
"Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon."
"And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly."
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
"For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor."
He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
"Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him."
"If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him."
"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you."
"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."
"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."
"Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards."
"Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake."
"Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice."
"Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me."
"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you."
"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."
"And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know."
"Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?"
"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
"If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him."
"Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us."
"Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?"
"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works."
"Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake."
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father."
"And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
"If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it."
"If ye love me, keep my commandments."
"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;"
"Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you."
I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
"Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also."
"At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you."
"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him."
"Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?"
"Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him."
"He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me."
"These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you."
"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."
"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."
"Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I."
"And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe."
"Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me."
"But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence."
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman."
"Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit."
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me."
"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing."
"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned."
"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you."
"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples."
"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love."
"If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love."
"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full."
"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you."
"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
"Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you."
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you."
"These things I command you, that ye love one another."
"If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you."
"If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you."
"Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also."
"But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me."
"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin."
He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
"If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father."
"But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause."
"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:"
"And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning."
"These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended."
"They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service."
"And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me."
"But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you."
"But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?"
"But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart."
"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you."
"And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:"
"Of sin, because they believe not on me;"
"Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;"
"Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged."
"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now."
"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come."
"He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you."
"All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you."
"A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father."
"Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?"
"They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith."
"Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?"
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy."
"A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world."
"And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you."
"And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you."
"Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full."
"These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father."
"At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:"
"For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God."
"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."
"His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb."
"Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God."
"Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?"
"Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me."
"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."
"These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:"
"As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him."
"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."
I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was."
"I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word."
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
"For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me."
"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine."
"And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them."
"And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are."
"While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled."
"And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves."
"I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil."
"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
"As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world."
"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth."
"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;"
"That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me."
"And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:"
"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me."
"Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world."
"O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me."
"And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them."
"When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples."
"And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples."
"Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons."
"Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?"
"They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them."
"As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground."
"Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth."
"Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:"
"That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none."
"Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus."
"Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"
"Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,"
"And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year."
"Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people."
"And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest."
"But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter."
"Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not."
"And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself."
"The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine."
"Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing."
"Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said."
"And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?"
"Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?"
Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
"And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not."
"One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?"
Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
"Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover."
"Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?"
"They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee."
"Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:"
"That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die."
"Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?"
"Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?"
"Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?"
"Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence."
"Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."
"Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all."
"But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"
"Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber."
"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him."
"And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,"
"And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands."
"Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him."
"Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!"
"When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him."
"The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;"
"And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer."
"Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?"
"Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin."
"And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar."
"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha."
"And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!"
"But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priest answered, We have no king but Caesar."
"Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away."
"And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:"
"Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst."
"And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS."
"This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin."
"Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews."
"Pilate answered, What I have written I have written."
"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout."
"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did."
"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene."
"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!"
"Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home."
"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst."
"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth."
"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."
"The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away."
"Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him."
"But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:"
"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water."
"And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe."
"For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken."
"And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced."
"And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus."
"And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight."
"Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury."
"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid."
There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
"The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre."
"Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him."
"Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre."
"So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre."
"And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in."
"Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,"
"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself."
"Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed."
"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead."
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,"
"And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain."
"And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him."
"And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus."
"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away."
"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master."
"Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God."
"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her."
"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."
"And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord."
"Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you."
"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:"
"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained."
"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."
"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."
"And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you."
"Then saith he to Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing."
"And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God."
"Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed."
"And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:"
"But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name."
After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.
"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples."
"Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing."
"But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus."
"Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No."
"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."
"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea."
"And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes."
"As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread."
"Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught."
"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken."
"Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord."
"Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise."
"This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead."
"So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs."
"He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep."
"He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep."
"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not."
"This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me."
"Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?"
"Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?"
"Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me."
"Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"
"This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true."
"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."
"The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,"
"Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:"
"To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:"
"And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me."
For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.
"When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"
"And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power."
"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."
"And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight."
"And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;"
"Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey."
"And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James."
"These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren."
"And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)"
"Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus."
"For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry."
"Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out."
"And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood."
"For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take."
"Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
"Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection."
"And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias."
"And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,"
"That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place."
And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place."
"And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting."
"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them."
"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."
"And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven."
"Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language."
"And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?"
"And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?"
"Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,"
"Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,"
"Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God."
"And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?"
"Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine."
"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:"
"For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day."
But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;
"And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:"
And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:
"And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:"
"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:"
"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
"Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:"
"Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:"
"Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it."
"For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:"
"Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:"
"Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
"Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day."
"Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;"
"He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption."
"This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses."
"Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear."
"For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"
Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ."
"Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
"For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call."
"And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation."
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.
"And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."
And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
"And all that believed were together, and had all things common;"
"And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need."
"And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,"
"Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved."
"Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour."
"And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;"
Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us."
"And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them."
"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."
"And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength."
"And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God."
And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
"And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering."
"And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?"
"The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go."
"But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;"
"And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses."
"And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all."
"And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers."
"But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled."
"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;"
"And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:"
"Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began."
"For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you."
"And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people."
"Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days."
"Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed."
"Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities."
"And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,"
"Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
"And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide."
Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,"
"And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem."
"And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?"
"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,"
"If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;"
"Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole."
"This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner."
"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus."
"And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."
"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"
"Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it."
"But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name."
"And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus."
"But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."
For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
"So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done."
"For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed."
"And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them."
"And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:"
"Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?"
"The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ."
"For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,"
For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
"And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,"
By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
"And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness."
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
"Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,"
And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
"And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,"
"Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet."
"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,"
"And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet."
"But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?"
"Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God."
"And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things."
"And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him."
"And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in."
"And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much."
"Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out."
"Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband."
"And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things."
And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.
And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.
"And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)"
"Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them."
"There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one."
"Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,"
"And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison."
"But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,"
"Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
"And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought."
"But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,"
"Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within."
"Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow."
"Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people."
"Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned."
"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,"
"Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
"Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men."
"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree."
"Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."
"And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him."
"When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them."
"Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;"
"And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men."
"For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought."
"After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed."
"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:"
"But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God."
"And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."
"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name."
"And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."
"And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration."
"Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables."
"Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."
"But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."
"And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:"
"Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them."
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
"And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people."
"Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen."
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
"Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God."
"And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,"
"And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:"
"For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us."
"And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel."
"Then said the high priest, Are these things so?"
"And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,"
"And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee."
"Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell."
"And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child."
"And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years."
"And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place."
"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs."
"And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,"
"And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house."
"Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance."
"But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first."
And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
"Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls."
"So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,"
"And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem."
"But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,"
"Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph."
"The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live."
"In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:"
"And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son."
"And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds."
"And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel."
"And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:"
For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
"And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?"
"But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?"
"Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?"
"Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons."
"And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush."
"When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,"
"Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abrham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold."
"Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground."
"I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt."
"This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush."
"He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years."
"This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear."
"This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:"
"To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,"
"Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him."
"And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands."
"Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?"
"Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
"Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen."
"Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;"
"Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob."
But Solomon built him an house.
"Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,"
"Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?"
Hath not my hand made all these things?
"Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye."
"Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it."
"When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth."
"But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,"
"And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God."
"Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,"
"And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul."
"And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
"And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
"And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles."
"And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him."
"As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison."
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
"Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them."
"And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did."
"For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed."
And there was great joy in that city.
"But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:"
"To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God."
"And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries."
"But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."
"Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done."
"Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:"
"Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:"
(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
"Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost."
"And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,"
"Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost."
"But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money."
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
"Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee."
"For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity."
"Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me."
"And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans."
"And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert."
"And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,"
"Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet."
"Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot."
"And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?"
"And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him."
"The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:"
In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
"And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?"
"Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus."
"And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?"
"And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
"And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him."
"And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing."
"But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea."
"And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,"
"And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem."
"And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:"
"And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
"And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
"And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do."
"And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man."
"And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus."
"And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink."
"And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord."
"And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,"
"And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight."
"Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:"
And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
"But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:"
For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
"And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost."
"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized."
"And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus."
"And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God."
"But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?"
"But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ."
"And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:"
But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
"Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket."
"And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple."
"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus."
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
"And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him."
"Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus."
"Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied."
"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda."
"And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy."
"And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately."
"And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord."
"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did."
"And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber."
"And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them."
"Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them."
"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
"And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive."
And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.
"And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner."
"There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,"
"A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway."
"He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius."
"And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God."
"And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:"
"He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do."
"And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;"
"And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa."
"On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:"
"And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,"
"And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:"
"Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
"And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat."
"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean."
"And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common."
This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
"Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,"
"And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there."
"While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee."
"Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them."
"Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?"
"And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee."
"Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him."
"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him."
"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man."
"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together."
"And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean."
"Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?"
"And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,"
"And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God."
"Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee."
"Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God."
"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:"
"But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him."
"The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)"
"That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;"
"How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him."
"And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:"
"Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;"
"Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead."
"And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead."
"To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins."
"While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word."
"And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost."
"For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,"
"Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?"
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
"And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,"
"Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them."
"But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,"
"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:"
"Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
"And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat."
"But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth."
"But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common."
And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
"And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me."
"And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:"
"And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;"
"Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved."
"And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning."
"Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost."
"Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?"
"When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life."
"Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only."
"And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus."
"And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord."
"Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch."
"Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord."
"For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord."
"Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:"
"And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch."
And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
"And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar."
"Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:"
"Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul."
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
"And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)"
"And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people."
Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
"And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison."
"And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands."
"And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me."
"And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision."
"When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him."
"And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews."
"And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying."
"And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda."
"And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate."
"And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel."
"But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished."
"But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place."
"Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter."
"And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode."
"And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country."
"And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them."
"And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man."
"And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost."
But the word of God grew and multiplied.
"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark."
"Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
"As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them."
"And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away."
"So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus."
"And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister."
"And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:"
"Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God."
"But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith."
"Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,"
"And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?"
"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand."
"Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord."
"Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem."
"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down."
"And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on."
"Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience."
"The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it."
And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.
"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot."
"And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet."
"And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years."
"And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will."
"Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:"
When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
"And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose."
"Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent."
"For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him."
"And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain."
"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre."
But God raised him from the dead:
"And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people."
"And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,"
"God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
"And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David."
"Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."
"For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:"
"But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption."
"Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:"
"And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses."
"Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;"
"Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you."
"And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath."
"Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God."
And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.
"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming."
"Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles."
"For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth."
"And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed."
And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
"But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts."
"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium."
"And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost."
"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed."
"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren."
"Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
"But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles."
"And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,"
"They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:"
And there they preached the gospel.
"And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:"
"The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,"
"Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked."
"And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men."
"And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker."
"Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people."
"Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,"
"And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:"
Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
"Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
"And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them."
"And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead."
"Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."
"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,"
"Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."
"And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed."
"And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia."
"And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:"
"And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled."
"And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles."
And there they abode long time with the disciples.
"And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved."
"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question."
"And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren."
"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them."
"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."
And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.
"And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe."
"And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;"
"And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."
"Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
"But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they."
"Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them."
"And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:"
"Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name."
"And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,"
"After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:"
"That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things."
Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
"Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:"
"But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood."
"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."
"Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:"
And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:
"Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:"
"It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth."
"For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;"
"That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well."
"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:"
"Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation."
"And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them."
"And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles."
Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
"Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."
"And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do."
"And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark."
"But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work."
"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;"
"And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God."
"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches."
"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:"
Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.
"And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem."
"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."
"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,"
"After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not."
And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."
"And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them."
"Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;"
"And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days."
"And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither."
"And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul."
"And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us."
"And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:"
"The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation."
"And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."
"And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,"
"And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,"
"And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans."
"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them."
"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:"
"Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks."
"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them."
"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed."
"And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled."
"But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here."
"Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,"
"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."
"And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house."
"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway."
"And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house."
"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go."
"And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace."
"But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out."
"And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans."
"And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city."
"And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed."
"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:"
"And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,"
"Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ."
"And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few."
"But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."
"And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;"
"Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus."
"And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things."
"And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go."
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.
"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
"Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few."
"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people."
And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.
"And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed."
"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."
"Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
"Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."
"And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?"
For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
"(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)"
"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious."
"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."
"God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;"
"Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;"
"And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;"
"That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:"
"For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."
"Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device."
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
"Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead."
"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter."
So Paul departed from among them.
"Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them."
"After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;"
"And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them."
"And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers."
"And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."
"And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ."
"And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles."
"And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue."
"And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized."
"Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:"
"For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city."
"And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
"And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,"
"Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law."
"And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:"
"But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters."
And he drave them from the judgment seat.
"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things."
"And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow."
"And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews."
"When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;"
"But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus."
"And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch."
"And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples."
"And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus."
"This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John."
"And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly."
"And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:"
"For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ."
"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,"
"He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost."
"And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism."
"Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."
"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied."
And all the men were about twelve.
"And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God."
"But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus."
"And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."
And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
"So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
"Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth."
"And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so."
"And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?"
"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
"And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
"And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds."
"Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
"After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
"So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season."
And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;"
"Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth."
"Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:"
"So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth."
"And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
"And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre."
"And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not."
"And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre."
"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together."
"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people."
"But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
"And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?"
"Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."
"For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess."
"Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another."
"But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."
"For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse."
"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly."
"And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia."
"And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,"
"And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia."
"And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus."
These going before tarried for us at Troas.
"And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days."
"And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight."
"And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together."
"And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead."
"And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him."
"When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed."
"And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted."
"And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot."
"And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene."
"And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus."
"For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost."
"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church."
"And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,"
"Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:"
"And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,"
"Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."
"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:"
"Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me."
"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God."
"And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more."
"Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men."
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood."
"For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock."
"Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them."
"Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears."
"And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified."
"I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel."
"Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me."
"I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive."
"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all."
"And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,"
"Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship."
"And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:"
"And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth."
"Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden."
"And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem."
"And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed."
"And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again."
"And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day."
"And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him."
"And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy."
"And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus."
"And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."
"And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem."
"Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done."
"And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem."
"There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge."
"And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly."
And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
"And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry."
"And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:"
"And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs."
What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;
"Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law."
"As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication."
"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purifcation, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them."
"And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,"
"Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place."
"(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)"
"And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut."
"And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."
"Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul."
"Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done."
"And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle."
"And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people."
"For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him."
"And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?"
"Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"
"But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people."
"And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,"
"Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you."
"(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)"
"I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day."
"And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women."
"As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished."
"And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me."
"And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
"And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest."
"And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me."
"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do."
"And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus."
"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,"
"Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him."
"And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth."
For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
"And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord."
"And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;"
"And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me."
"And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:"
"And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him."
"And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles."
"And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live."
"And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,"
"The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him."
"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?"
"When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman."
"Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea."
"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born."
"Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."
"On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them."
"And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
"Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?"
"And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?"
"Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."
"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."
"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided."
"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both."
"And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God."
"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle."
"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome."
"And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul."
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
"And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul."
"And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul."
"Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him."
"So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee."
"Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?"
"And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly."
"But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee."
"So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me."
"And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;"
"And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor."
And he wrote a letter after this manner:
Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.
"This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman."
"And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:"
"Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."
"And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell."
"Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris."
"On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:"
"Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him."
"And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;"
"I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall."
"And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul."
"And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,"
"We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness."
"Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words."
"For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:"
"Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law."
"But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,"
"Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him."
"And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so."
"Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:"
"Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship."
"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:"
Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
"But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:"
"And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
"And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men."
"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."
"Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."
"Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me."
"Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,"
"Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
"And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter."
"And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him."
"And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."
"And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee."
"He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him."
"But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."
"Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
"Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,"
"And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him."
"But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither."
"Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him."
"And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought."
"And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove."
"While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all."
"But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"
"Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest."
"For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar."
"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go."
And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
"And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:"
"About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him."
"To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him."
"Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth."
"Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:"
"But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
"And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters."
"But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar."
"Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him."
"And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth."
"And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer."
"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him."
"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write."
"For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him."
"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:"
"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:"
Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;"
"Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
"Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews."
"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?"
"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
"Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them."
"And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities."
"Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,"
"At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me."
"And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
"And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest."
"But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;"
"Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,"
"To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me."
"Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:"
"But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance."
"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me."
"Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:"
"That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles."
"And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad."
"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness."
"For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."
"King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest."
"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."
"And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."
"And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:"
"And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
"Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar."
"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band."
"And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us."
"And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself."
"And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."
"And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia."
And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;"
"And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea."
"Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,"
"And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives."
"Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul."
"And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west."
"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete."
"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon."
"And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive."
"And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:"
"Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven."
"And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;"
And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
"And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away."
"But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss."
"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship."
"For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,"
"Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee."
"Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me."
Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;"
"And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms."
"Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day."
"And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,"
"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved."
"Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off."
"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing."
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat."
"Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat."
And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea."
"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship."
"And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore."
"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves."
"And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape."
"But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:"
"And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land."
"And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita."
"And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold."
"And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand."
"And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live."
"And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm."
"Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."
"In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously."
"And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him."
"So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:"
"Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary."
"And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux."
"And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days."
"And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:"
"Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome."
"And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appiiforum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage."
"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him."
"And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
"Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me."
"But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of."
"For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
"And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee."
"But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against."
"And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening."
"And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not."
"And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,"
"Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:"
"For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
"Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it."
"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves."
"And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,"
"Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him."
"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,"
"(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)"
"Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;"
"And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:"
"By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:"
Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
"To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world."
"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;"
"Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you."
"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;"
"That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
"Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles."
"I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise."
"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also."
"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
"For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."
"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;"
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.
"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:"
"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"
"And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."
"Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:"
"Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet."
"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;"
"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
"Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
"Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:"
"Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
"Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things."
But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
"And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?"
Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
"To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:"
"But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,"
"Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;"
"But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:"
For there is no respect of persons with God.
For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
"(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:"
"Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)"
In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
"Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,"
"And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;"
"And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,"
"An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law."
"Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?"
"Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?"
"Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?"
"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written."
"For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision."
"Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?"
"And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?"
"For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:"
"But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God."
What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
"Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God."
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
"God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged."
"But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)"
God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
"And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just."
"What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;"
"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God."
"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."
Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
Their feet are swift to shed blood:
Destruction and misery are in their ways:
And the way of peace have they not known:
There is no fear of God before their eyes.
"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;"
Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
"Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;"
"To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."
Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
"Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:"
"Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
"What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?"
"For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God."
"For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."
"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt."
"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
"Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,"
"Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
"Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness."
"How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:"
"And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised."
"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
"For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:"
"Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression."
"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,"
"(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were."
"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be."
"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:"
"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;"
"And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform."
And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;"
"But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;"
"Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification."
"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:"
"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;"
"And patience, experience; and experience, hope:"
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
"And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement."
"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:"
(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
"But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many."
"And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification."
"For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)"
Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.
"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:"
"That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
"God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"
"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?"
"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:"
"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin."
For he that is dead is freed from sin.
"Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:"
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God."
"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof."
"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God."
"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace."
"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."
"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
"Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness."
I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
"For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness."
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life."
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
"Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?"
"For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband."
"So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."
"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death."
"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter."
"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet."
"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead."
"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
"And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death."
"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."
"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I."
"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good."
"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not."
"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."
"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:"
"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you."
"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh."
"For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."
"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."
"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:"
"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
"For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,"
Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
"And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body."
"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?"
"But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
"And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God."
"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."
"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
"What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?"
"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.
"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."
"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
"As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,"
"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,"
That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
"For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:"
"Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;"
"Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen."
"Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:"
"Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called."
"That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed."
"For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son."
"And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;"
"(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)"
"It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger."
"As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
"For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
"So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy."
"For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth."
"Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth."
"Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?"
"Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?"
"Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"
"What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:"
"And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,"
"Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?"
"As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved."
"And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God."
"Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:"
"For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth."
"And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha."
"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith."
"But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness."
"Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;"
"As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved."
"For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."
"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
"For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them."
"But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)"
"Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)"
"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;"
"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
"For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
"And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"
"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?"
"So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."
"But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."
"But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you."
"But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me."
"But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people."
"I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
"God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,"
"Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
"But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal."
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
"And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."
"What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded"
"(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day."
"And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompence unto them:"
"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway."
"I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy."
"Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?"
"For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:"
"If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them."
"For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?"
"For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches."
"And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;"
"Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee."
"Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in."
"Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:"
"For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee."
"Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off."
"And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again."
"For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?"
"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in."
"And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:"
"For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins."
"As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes."
For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
"For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:"
"Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy."
"For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all."
"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!"
For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?
"Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?"
"For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen."
"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."
"And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."
"For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith."
"For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:"
"So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another."
"Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;"
"Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;"
"Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness."
Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
"Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not."
"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
"Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits."
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
"If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."
"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."
"Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head."
"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation."
"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:"
"For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."
"Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake."
"For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing."
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
"Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law."
"For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
"And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed."
"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."
"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying."
"But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."
"Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations."
"For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs."
Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
"Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand."
One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
"He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks."
"For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself."
"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's."
"For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living."
But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
"For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way."
"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean."
"But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died."
Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."
"For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men."
"Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another."
For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
"It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak."
Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
"And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin."
"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.
"For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me."
"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope."
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
"That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
"Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God."
"Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:"
"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name."
"And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people."
"And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people."
"And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust."
"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost."
"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another."
"Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,"
"That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost."
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,"
"Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
"Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:"
"But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand."
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
"But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;"
"Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company."
But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
"It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things."
"When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain."
"And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ."
"Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;"
That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
"That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed."
Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
"I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:"
"That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also."
Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:
"Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
"Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ."
"Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us."
"Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
"Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved."
Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household.
"Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord."
"Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord."
"Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine."
"Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them."
"Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them."
Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
"Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them."
"For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple."
"For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil."
And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
"Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you."
"I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord."
"Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother."
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
"Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,"
"But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:"
"To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen."
"Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,"
"Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:"
"Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
"I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;"
"That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;"
Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
"Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
"God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
"For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
"Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
"I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;"
Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect."
For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
"But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;"
"But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:"
But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:"
That no flesh should glory in his presence.
"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:"
"That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God."
"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:"
"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:"
"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:"
"Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."
"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."
"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ."
"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able."
"For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?"
"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?"
"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?"
"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase."
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
"For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building."
"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon."
"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;"
"Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is."
"If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward."
"If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."
"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness."
"And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;"
And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God."
"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self."
For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."
"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."
"For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?"
"Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you."
"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
"We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised."
"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;"
"And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:"
"Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day."
"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you."
"For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
"Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me."
"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church."
"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you."
"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power."
"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."
"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?"
"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife."
"And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."
"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,"
"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:"
"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
"Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world."
"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat."
For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"
"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
"But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers."
"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?"
"Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren."
"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"
"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."
"And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power."
"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid."
"What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh."
But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that commiteth fornication sinneth against his own body.
"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?"
"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."
Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
"Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife."
"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency."
"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment."
"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that."
"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I."
"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
"And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:"
"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife."
"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away."
"And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace."
"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?"
"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches."
Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
"Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather."
"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant."
Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
"Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God."
"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful."
"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be."
Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
"But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
"But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;"
"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;"
"And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away."
"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:"
"But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife."
"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry."
"Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well."
So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.
"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord."
"But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
"Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth."
"And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."
"But if any man love God, the same is known of him."
"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one."
"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)"
"But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him."
Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
"But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse."
But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
"For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
"And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
"But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ."
"Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."
Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
"If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord."
"Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,"
Have we not power to eat and to drink?
"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?"
"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?"
"Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
"For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"
"Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope."
"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?"
"If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ."
Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the alter are partakers with the alter?
Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void."
"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!"
"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me."
"What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel."
"For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more."
"And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;"
"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law."
"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."
"And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you."
"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain."
And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:"
"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."
"Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents."
"Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer."
"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."
"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
"For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the alter?
"What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
"But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils."
"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils."
Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
"Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth."
"Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:"
"For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof."
"If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake."
"But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:"
"Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?"
"For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."
"Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:"
"Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."
"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you."
"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God."
"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head."
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
"For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."
"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man."
For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."
"For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of god."
Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering."
"But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."
"Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse."
"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
"For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you."
"When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper."
"For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken."
"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not."
"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:"
"And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."
"After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me."
"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come."
"Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."
"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup."
"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body."
"For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep."
"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another."
"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant."
"Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led."
"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."
"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
"And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord."
"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all."
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will."
"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ."
"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
"For the body is not one member, but many."
"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
"If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?"
"But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him."
"And if they were all one member, where were the body?"
"But now are they many members, yet but one body."
"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
"Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
"And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness."
"For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:"
That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
"And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."
"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues."
Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."
"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."
"Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,"
"Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;"
"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;"
"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
"Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away."
"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."
"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."
"For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries."
"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort."
He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
"I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
"Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?"
"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air."
"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification."
"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me."
"Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church."
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
"For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful."
"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."
"Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?"
"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."
"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:"
"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."
"Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men."
"In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord."
"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe."
"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?"
"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:"
"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth."
"How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, everyone of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."
"If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret."
"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God."
"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge."
"If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace."
"For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted."
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law."
"And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
"If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord."
"But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant."
"Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues."
Let all things be done decently and in order.
"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;"
"By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain."
"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;"
"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:"
"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep."
"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles."
"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time."
"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
"Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed."
"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"
"And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain."
"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not."
"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:"
"And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins."
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept."
"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead."
"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
"Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power."
"For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet."
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
"For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him."
"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."
"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die."
Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."
"But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"
"Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:"
"And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:"
"But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body."
"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds."
"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."
"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit."
"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."
"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven."
"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."
"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."
"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."
"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"
"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"
The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."
"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye."
"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."
"And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem."
"And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me."
"Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia."
"And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go."
"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit."
But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries."
"Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do."
"Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren."
"As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time."
"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong."
Let all your things be done with charity.
"I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)"
"That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth."
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
"If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha."
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:"
"Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;"
"Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God."
"For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ."
"And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation."
"And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation."
"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:"
"But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:"
"Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;"
"Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf."
"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward."
"For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;"
"As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus."
"And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;"
"And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea."
"When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?"
"But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay."
"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea."
"For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us."
"Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;"
"Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
"Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth."
"Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand."
"But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness."
"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?"
"And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all."
"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you."
"But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all."
"Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many."
"So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow."
Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.
"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things."
"To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;"
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,"
"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia."
"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."
"For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:"
To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
"For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ."
"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?"
"Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:"
"Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."
And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
"Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life."
"But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:"
How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
"For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory."
"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth."
"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious."
"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:"
"And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:"
But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.
"But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart."
"Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away."
"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;"
"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake."
"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."
"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;"
"Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;"
"Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body."
"For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh."
"So then death worketh in us, but life in you."
"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;"
"Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you."
"For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God."
"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;"
"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:"
If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
"For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."
"Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."
"Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:"
"(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)"
"We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."
"Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him."
"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."
"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences."
"For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart."
"For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause."
"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:"
"And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again."
"Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more."
"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
"And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;"
"To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."
"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."
"For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
"We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain."
"(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)"
"Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:"
"But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,"
"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;"
"By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,"
"By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
"By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;"
"As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;"
"As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
"O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged."
"Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels."
"Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged."
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,"
"And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."
"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
"Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man."
"I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you."
"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation."
"For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears."
"Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more."
"For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season."
"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing."
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
"For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
"Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you."
"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all."
"For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth."
"And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him."
I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
"Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;"
How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
"For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;"
"Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints."
"And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God."
"Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also."
"Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also."
"I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love."
"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich."
"And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago."
"Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have."
"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not."
"For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:"
"But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:"
"As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack."
"But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you."
"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you."
"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;"
"And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:"
"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:"
"Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you."
"Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ."
"Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."
"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:"
"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many."
"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:"
"Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting."
"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness."
"But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully."
"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."
"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:"
"(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever."
"Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)"
"Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God."
"For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;"
"Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;"
"And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you."
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:"
"But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:"
"(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)"
"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;"
"And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."
"Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's."
"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:"
That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
"For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible."
"Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present."
"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
"But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."
"For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:"
"Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"
"To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand."
"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth."
Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.
"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."
"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
"For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him."
For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
"But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things."
"Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?"
"I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service."
"And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself."
"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we."
"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ."
And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
"I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
"That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also."
"For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise."
"For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face."
"I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also."
Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft."
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
"In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;"
"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
"Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches."
"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?"
"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities."
"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not."
"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:"
"And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands."
It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven."
"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)"
"How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities."
"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me."
"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me."
"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
"I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing."
"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."
"For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."
"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved."
"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile."
Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
"I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?"
"Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying."
"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:"
"And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed."
This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
"I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:"
"Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you."
"For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you."
"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?"
But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
"Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates."
"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
"For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection."
"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction."
"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."
Greet one another with an holy kiss.
All the saints salute you.
"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen."
"Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)"
"And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:"
"Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:"
To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
"Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
"As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed."
"For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man."
"For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
"For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:"
"And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers."
"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,"
"To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:"
"Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus."
"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days."
"But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother."
"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not."
Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
"But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed."
And they glorified God in me.
"Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also."
"And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain."
"But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:"
"And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:"
"To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
"But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:"
"But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;"
"(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)"
"And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision."
Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
"But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
"For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision."
And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"
"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid."
"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
"For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God."
"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
"I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain."
"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?"
"This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.
"He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
"Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed."
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith."
"And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them."
"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:"
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto."
"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
"And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."
"For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise."
"Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."
"Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one."
"Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law."
"But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."
"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
"Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
"But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."
"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."
"Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;"
But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:"
"But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,"
"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."
"And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father."
"Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
"Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods."
"But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?"
"Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years."
"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain."
"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all."
Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
"And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus."
"Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me."
"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
"They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them."
"But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you."
"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,"
"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you."
"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman."
But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.
"Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar."
"For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children."
"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all."
"For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband."
"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."
"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now."
Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."
"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
"Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."
Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.
A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
"I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be."
"And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased."
I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
"For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."
"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another."
"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulful the lust of the flesh."
"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would."
"But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."
"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,"
"Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,"
"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,"
"Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."
And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
"For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."
"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
For every man shall bear his own burden.
Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
"As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."
Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
"As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh."
"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."
"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God."
From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
"Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
"Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:"
"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:"
"Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,"
"To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved."
"In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;"
Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:"
"That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:"
"In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:"
"That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ."
"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,"
"Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory."
"Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,"
"Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;"
"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:"
"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,"
"And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,"
"Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,"
"Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:"
"And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,"
"Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all."
"And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;"
"Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:"
"Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,"
"Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)"
"And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:"
That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
"Not of works, lest any man should boast."
"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."
"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;"
"That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:"
But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
"For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;"
"Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;"
"And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:"
"And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh."
For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;"
"And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;"
In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,"
If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward:
"How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,"
"Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)"
"Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;"
"That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:"
"Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;"
"And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:"
"To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,"
According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
"Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
"That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;"
"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,"
"May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;"
"And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God."
"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,"
"Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."
"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,"
"With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;"
Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;"
"One Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
"One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."
But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
"Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."
"(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)"
"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;"
"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:"
"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:"
"That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;"
"But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:"
"From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,"
"Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:"
"Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
But ye have not so learned Christ;
"If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:"
"That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;"
And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
"And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
"Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another."
"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:"
Neither give place to the devil.
"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth."
"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."
"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption."
"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:"
"And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."
"Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;"
"And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour."
"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;"
"Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks."
"For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
"For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:"
(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them."
For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
"Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light."
"See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,"
"Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
"Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is."
"And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;"
"Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;"
Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord."
"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body."
"Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing."
"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"
"That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,"
"That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:"
"For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh."
This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right."
Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
"That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth."
"And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;"
"Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;"
"With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:"
"Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free."
"And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him."
"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
"Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
"Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"
"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
"And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
"For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
"But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:"
"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts."
"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,"
"To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
"Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,"
"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;"
"Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:"
"As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;"
Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;"
"That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
"Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;"
"Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:"
"Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:"
"In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:"
"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:"
"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:"
"And he is before all things, and by him all things consist."
"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence."
For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
"And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven."
"And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled"
"In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:"
"If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;"
"Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:"
"Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;"
"Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:"
"To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:"
"Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:"
"Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily."
"For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;"
"That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;"
In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
"And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words."
"For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ."
"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:"
"Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving."
"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
"And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:"
"In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:"
"Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead."
"And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;"
"Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;"
"And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:"
Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
"Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
"And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God."
"Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,"
(Touch not; taste not; handle not;
Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
"Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh."
"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."
"Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory."
"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:"
For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
"In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them."
"But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
"Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;"
"And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:"
"Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all."
"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;"
"Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye."
"And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."
"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful."
"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
"And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him."
"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord."
"Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them."
"Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord."
"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
"Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:"
"And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;"
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
"Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven."
"Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;"
"Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:"
"That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."
"Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time."
"Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man."
"All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:"
"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;"
"With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here."
"Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)"
"And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me."
"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God."
"For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis."
"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you."
"Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house."
"And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea."
"And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it."
The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;"
"Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;"
"Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God."
"For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake."
"And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:"
So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
"For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing."
"For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;"
"And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come."
"For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:"
"But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention."
"For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:"
"But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts."
"For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:"
"Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ."
"But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:"
"So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us."
"For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God."
"Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:"
"As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,"
"That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory."
"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe."
"For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:"
"Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:"
"Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."
"But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."
"Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us."
"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?"
For ye are our glory and joy.
"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;"
"And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:"
That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
"For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know."
"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain."
"But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:"
"Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:"
"For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord."
"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;"
"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
"Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you."
"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:"
"To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
"Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more."
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:"
That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
"Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:"
"That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified."
"For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness."
"He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit."
But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
"And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;"
"And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
"That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing."
"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope."
"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."
"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep."
"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:"
"Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you."
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."
"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."
"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."
"Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober."
For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation."
"For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
"Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do."
"And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;"
And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men."
"See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men."
Rejoice evermore.
Pray without ceasing.
In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
Quench not the Spirit.
Despise not prophesyings.
Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
Abstain from all appearance of evil.
And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."
"Brethren, pray for us."
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
"Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;"
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:
"Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:"
Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"
"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"
"When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."
"Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:"
"That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,"
"That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand."
"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"
"Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."
"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
"For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way."
"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"
"Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
"And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"
"That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
"But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:"
"Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."
"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,"
"Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work."
"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:"
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.
"But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil."
"And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you."
"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ."
"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us."
For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
"Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:"
"Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us."
"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
"For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."
"Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
"But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing."
"And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."
"Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
"The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write."
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;"
"Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
"As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
"Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do."
"Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:"
From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
"Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm."
"But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;"
"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
"For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"
"According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"
"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
"Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
"This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;"
"Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"
"Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;"
"For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"
"Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."
"Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity."
"I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;"
But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
"But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
"For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."
"Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."
"This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work."
"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"
"Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;"
"One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;"
"(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)"
"Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
"Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;"
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
"And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless."
"Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."
"Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
"For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
"These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:"
"But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;"
Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
"Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth."
"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:"
For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
"If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained."
"But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness."
"For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
"For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe."
These things command and teach.
"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."
Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee."
"Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;"
"The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."
Honour widows that are widows indeed.
"But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."
"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day."
But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
"And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless."
"But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."
"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,"
"Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work."
"But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;"
"Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."
"And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."
"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
For some are already turned aside after Satan.
"If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."
"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine."
"For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward."
"Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses."
"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear."
"I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."
"Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure."
"Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities."
"Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after."
Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed."
"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort."
"If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;"
"He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,"
"Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself."
But godliness with contentment is great gain.
"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."
And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."
"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."

"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses."
"I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;"
"That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
"Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;"
"Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen."
"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;"
"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;"
"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."
"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:"
Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,"
"To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
"I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;"
"Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;"
"When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also."
"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands."
"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."
"Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;"
"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"
"But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:"
"Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
"For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
"Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
"This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes."
"The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:"
"But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me."
"The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well."
"Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
"And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."

No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
"And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully."
The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
"Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound."
"Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
"It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:"
"If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:"
"If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself."
"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers."
"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
"Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."
"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."
"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour."
"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work."
"Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
"But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes."
"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,"
In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
"And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."
"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."
"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"
"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;"
"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."
"For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,"
"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
"Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith."
"But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was."
"But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,"
"Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me."
"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
"But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."
"But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;"
"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."
"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:"
"That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."
"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;"
"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine."
"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;"
"And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."
"But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry."
"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand."
"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:"
"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."
Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
"For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia."
"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry."
And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
"The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments."
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
"At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge."
"Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."
"And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."
"Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
"Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren."
The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;"
"In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;"
"But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;"
"To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour."
"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:"
"If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly."
"For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;"
"But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;"
"Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers."
"For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:"
"Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake."
"One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."
"This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;"
"Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."
Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
"They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate."
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
"That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience."
"The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;"
"That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,"
"To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
"In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,"
"Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."
"Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;"
"Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."
"For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,"
"Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"
"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;"
"Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee."
"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,"
"To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men."
"For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."
"But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,"
"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;"
Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
"That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
"This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men."
"But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."
A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
"Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself."
"When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter."
"Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them."
"And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful."
All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,"
"And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:"
"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
"I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,"
"Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;"
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
"For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother."
"Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,"
"Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
"I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:"
"Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:"
"Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:"
"Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:"
"But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."
"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;"
"Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"
"If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."
"If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;"
"I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides."
"Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord."
"Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say."
But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
"There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;"
"Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers."
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,"
"Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;"
"Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;"
"Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
"And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him."
"And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."
"But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom."
"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."
"And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:"
They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
"And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."
"But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"
"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip."
"For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;"
"How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;"
"God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?"
"For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak."
"But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?"
"Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:"
"Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."
"For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
"For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
"Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee."
"And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me."
"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;"
And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.
"Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people."
"For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted."
"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;"
"Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house."
"For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house."
For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.
"And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;"
"But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."
"Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,"
"Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:"
"When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years."
"Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways."
"So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)"
"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God."
"But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
"For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;"
"While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
"For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses."
"But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?"
"And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
"Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."
"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."
"For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
"For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works."
"And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest."
"Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:"
"Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
"For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day."
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
"For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his."
"Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief."
"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession."
"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."
"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."
"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:"
"Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity."
"And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins."
"And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron."
"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee."
"As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;"
"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;"
"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;"
Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing."
"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat."
For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,"
"Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
"And this will we do, if God permit."
"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,"
"And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,"
"If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."
"For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:"
"But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned."
"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."
"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
"That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
"For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,"
"Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."
"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
"Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:"
"That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:"
"Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;"
"Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
"For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;"
"To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;"
"Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually."
"Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils."
"And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:"
"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises."
And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
"And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth."
"And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham."
"For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him."
"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"
"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."
"For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar."
For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
"And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,"
"Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life."
"For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
"For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God."
And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:
"(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)"
By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
"And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:"
"But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."
"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
"For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;"
"Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself."
"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."
"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;"
"A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
"For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:"
"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."
"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:"
"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."
"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:"
"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."
"In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away."
"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary."
"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;"
"Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;"
And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
"Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God."
"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:"
"The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:"
"Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;"
"Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."
"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;"
"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."
"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:"
"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."
"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."
For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.
"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"
"Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you."
"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."
And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:"
"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;"
For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"
So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
"For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."
For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.
For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
"Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:"
In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
"Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God."
"Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;"
"Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second."
By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:"
"But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;"
From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
"Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,"
"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;"
And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin."
"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,"
"By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"
And having an high priest over the house of God;
"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."
"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,"
"But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
"Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?"
"For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people."
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;"
"Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used."
"For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance."
"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward."
"For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise."
"For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry."
"Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."
But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
For by it the elders obtained a good report.
"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."
"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh."
"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God."
"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
"By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."
"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went."
"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:"
"For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised."
"Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."
"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
"And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned."
"But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city."
"By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,"
"Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:"
"Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure."
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
"By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff."
"By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones."
"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment."
"By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;"
"Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;"
Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible."
"Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them."
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days."
"By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace."
"And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:"
"Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"
"Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."
"Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:"
"And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:"
"They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;"
"(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth."
"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:"
"God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
"Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"
"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
"For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds."
"Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."
"And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:"
"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."
"If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"
"But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons."
"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"
"For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness."
"Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."
"Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;"
"And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed."
"Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:"
"Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;"
"Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright."
"For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears."
"For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"
"And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:"
"(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:"
"And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)"
"But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,"
"To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,"
"And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel."
"See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:"
"Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven."
"And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain."
"Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:"
For our God is a consuming fire.
Let brotherly love continue.
Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
"Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body."
"Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."
"Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
"So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me."
"Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation."
"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever."
"Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein."
"We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle."
"For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp."
"Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate."
"Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach."
"For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come."
"By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name."
But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
"Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you."
"Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly."
"But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner."
"Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
"Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."
"And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words."
"Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you."
"Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you."
Grace be with you all. Amen.
"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting."
"My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;"
"Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience."
"But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."
"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
"But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away."
"For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."
"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him."
"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:"
"But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed."
"Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death."
"Do not err, my beloved brethren."
"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."
"Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures."
"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:"
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
"Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."
"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."
"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:"
"For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was."
"But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."
"If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain."
"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."
"My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons."
"For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;"
"And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:"
"Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?"
"Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"
"But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?"
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
"If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:"
"But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."
"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law."
"So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."
"For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment."
"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?"
"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,"
"And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?"
"Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."
"Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works."
"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."
"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
"Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"
"And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God."
"Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
"Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?"
"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
"My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation."
"For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body."
"Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."
"Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth."
"Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"
"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."
"For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:"
"But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."
"Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God."
"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
"Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh."
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
"But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth."
"This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish."
"For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work."
"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
"From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?"
"Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not."
"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts."
"Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."
"Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"
"But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."
"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded."
"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness."
"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."
"Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge."
"There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?"
"Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:"
"Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away."
"For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that."
But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
"Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."
"Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you."
"Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten."
"Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days."
"Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth."
"Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter."
Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.
"Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."
Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
"Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door."
"Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience."
"But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation."
Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:"
"And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."
"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."
"Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months."
"And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit."
"Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;"
"Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins."
"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
"To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,"
Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
"Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:"
"That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:"
"Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:"
"Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
"Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:"
"Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow."
"Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into."
"Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"
"As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:"
"But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;"
"Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy."
"And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:"
"Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;"
"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:"
"Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,"
"Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God."
"Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:"
"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever."
"For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:"
But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
"Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,"
"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:"
If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
"To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,"
"Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."
"Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded."
"Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,"
"And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed."
"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:"
"Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;"
"Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation."
"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;"
"Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."
"For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
"As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God."
Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
"Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward."
"For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully."
"For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God."
"For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:"
"Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:"
"Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:"
"Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed."
For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
"Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;"
While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.
"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;"
"But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."
"For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"
"Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement."
"Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered."
"Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:"
"Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing."
"For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:"
"Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it."
"For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil."
"And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?"
"But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;"
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
"Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ."
"For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing."
"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:"
By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water."
"The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:"
"Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."
"Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;"
"That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."
"For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:"
"Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:"
Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
"For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
"But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer."
And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
"As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
"If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:"
"But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy."
"If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified."
"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters."
"Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."
"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?"
"And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
"Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."
"The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:"
"Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;"
"Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock."
"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."
"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble."
"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:"
Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"
"Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."
"But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you."
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
"By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand."
"The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son."
Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:"
"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,"
"According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:"
"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
"And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"
And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
"For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
"But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins."
"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:"
For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
"Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth."
"Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;"
"Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me."
Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
"For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
"And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount."
"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:"
"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
"And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not."
"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;"
"And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;"
"And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;"
"And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:"
"(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)"
"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"
"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities."
"Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord."
"But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;"
"And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;"
"Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:"
"Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
"These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever."
"For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error."
"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."
"For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning."
"For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."
"But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."
"This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:"
"That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:"
"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,"
"And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:"
"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"
"But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
"But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."
"Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,"
"Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
"Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."
And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
"As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
"Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness."
"But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen."
"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;"
"(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)"
"That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."
"And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:"
"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."
"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:"
"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."
"And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."
"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
"But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him."
"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."
"Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning."
"Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth."
"He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now."
"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him."
"But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes."
"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake."
"I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father."
"I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one."
"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world."
"And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."
"Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time."
"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."
"But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things."
"I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth."
"Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son."
"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also."
"Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father."
"And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life."
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.
"But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him."
"And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."
"If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him."
"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not."
"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."
"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
"Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him."
"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."
"He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil."
"Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother."
"For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."
"Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."
"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you."
"We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death."
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
"Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."
"But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"
"My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth."
"And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him."
"For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things."
"Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God."
"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."
"And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment."
"And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us."
"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
"And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."
"Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
"They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them."
"We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."
"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."
He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
"In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."
"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
"No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us."
"Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit."
And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God."
"And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him."
"Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world."
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
"We love him, because he first loved us."
"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"
"And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also."
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments."
"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."
"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."
"Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
"This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth."
"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one."
"And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one."
"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son."
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
"And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God."
"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:"
"And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him."
"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it."
All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
"We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not."
"And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness."
"And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life."
"Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."
"The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;"
"For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever."
"Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
"I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father."
"And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."
"And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it."
"For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist."
"Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward."
"Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son."
"If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:"
For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
"Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full."
The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
"The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth."
"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."
"For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth."
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
"Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;"
"Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:"
"Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles."
"We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth."
"I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not."
"Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church."
"Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God."
"Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true."
"I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:"
"But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name."
"Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:"
"Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied."
"Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints."
"For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ."
"I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not."
"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
"Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
"Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities."
"Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee."
"But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves."
"Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core."
"These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;"
"Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever."
"And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,"
"To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
"These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage."
"But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
"How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts."
"These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit."
"But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,"
"Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
"And of some have compassion, making a difference:"
"And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh."
"Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,"
"To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen."
"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:"
"Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw."
"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand."
"John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;"
"And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,"
And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
"Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen."
"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty."
"I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ."
"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,"
"Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea."
"And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;"
"And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle."
"His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;"
"And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters."
And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:"
"I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death."
"Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;"
"The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches."
"Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;"
"I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:"
"And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted."
"Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love."
"Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent."
"But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."
"And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;"
"I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan."
"Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."
"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death."
And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;
"I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth."
"But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication."
"So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate."
"Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth."
"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it."
"And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;"
"I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first."
"Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols."
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
"Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds."
And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.
"But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden."
But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
"And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:"
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
And I will give him the morning star.
"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."
"And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead."
"Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God."
"Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee."
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.
"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels."
"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;"
"I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."
"Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee."
"Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."
"Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown."
"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name."
"And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;"
"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot."
"So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth."
"Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:"
"I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see."
"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent."
"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."
"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."
"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."
"After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter."
"And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne."
"And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald."
"And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold."
"And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."
"And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind."
"And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle."
"And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come."
"And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,"
"The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,"
"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."
"And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals."
"And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?"
"And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon."
"And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon."
"And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof."
"And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."
And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
"And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints."
"And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;"
And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;"
"Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing."
"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever."
"And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever."
"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see."
"And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer."
"And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see."
"And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword."
"And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand."
"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine."
"And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see."
"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."
"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:"
"And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
"And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."
"And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;"
"And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind."
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
"And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;"
"And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:"
For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?
"And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree."
"And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,"
"Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."
And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.
Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
"After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;"
"And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb."
"And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,"
"Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen."
"And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?"
"And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
"Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them."
"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat."
"For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."
"And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour."
And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.
"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne."
"And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand."
"And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake."
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
"The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up."
"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;"
"And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed."
"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;"
"And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter."
"And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise."
"And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!"
"And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit."
"And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit."
"And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
"And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads."
"And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man."
"And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them."
"And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men."
"And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions."
"And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle."
"And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months."
"And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon."
"One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter."
"And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,"
"Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates."
"And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men."
And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.
"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone."
"By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths."
"For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt."
"And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:"
"Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts."
"And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:"
"And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,"
"And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices."
"And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not."
"And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,"
"And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:"
"But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets."
"And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth."
"And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey."
"And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter."
"And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings."
"And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein."
"But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months."
"And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth."
"These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth."
"And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed."
"These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will."
"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them."
"And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified."
"And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves."
"And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth."
"And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them."
"And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them."
"And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven."
"The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly."
"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever."
"And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,"
"Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned."
"And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth."
"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail."
"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:"
"And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered."
"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads."
"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born."
"And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne."
"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days."
"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,"
And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."
"And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night."
"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death."
"Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time."
"And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child."
"And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent."
"And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood."
"And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth."
"And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."
"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy."
"And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority."
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.
"And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?"
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.
"And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven."
"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations."
"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
"If any man have an ear, let him hear."
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
"And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon."
"And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed."
"And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,"
"And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live."
"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."
"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:"
"And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
"And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads."
"And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:"
"And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth."
"These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb."
And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.
"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,"
"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,"
"The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:"
"And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name."
"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
"And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them."
"And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle."
"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
"And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle."
"And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe."
"And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God."
"And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs."
"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God."
"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God."
"And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints."
"Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest."
"And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:"
"And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles."
"And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever."
"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled."
"And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth."
"And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image."
And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.
And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
"And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus."
"For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy."
"And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments."
And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.
"And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory."
"And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,"
"And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds."
"And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared."
"And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet."
"For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."
"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame."
And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
"And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done."
"And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great."
"And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath."
"And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
"And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great."
"And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:"
"With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication."
"So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."
"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:"
"And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration."
"And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns."
"The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is."
"And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth."
"And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space."
"And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition."
"And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast."
"These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast."
"These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful."
"And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."
"And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire."
"For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled."
"And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth."
"And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory."
"And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird."
"For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies."
"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."
"For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities."
"Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double."
"How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow."
"Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her."
"And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,"
"Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come."
And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
"The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,"
"And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men."
"And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all."
"The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,"
"And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!"
"For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,"
"And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!"
"And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate."
"Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her."
"And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all."
"And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;"
And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
"And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth."
"And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:"
"For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand."
"And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever."
"And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia."
"And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great."
"And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth."
"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready."
"And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints."
"And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God."
"And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
"And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war."
"His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself."
And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
"And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean."
"And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."
"And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
"And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;"
"That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great."
"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army."
"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
"And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh."
"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand."
"And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,"
"And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season."
"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."
But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years."
"And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,"
"And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea."
"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
"And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them."
"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
"And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
"And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God."
"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
"And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful."
"And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely."
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son."
"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
"And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife."
"And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,"
"Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;"
"And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:"
On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
"And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof."
"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."
"And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel."
"And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass."
"And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;"
"The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst."
"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass."
And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
"And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof."
And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.
And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
"And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life."
"And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."
"In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.
"And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever."
"And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done."
"Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book."
"And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things."
"Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God."
"And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand."
"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still."
"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."
"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last."
"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."
"For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie."
"I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star."
"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."
"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:"
"And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."
"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Welcome to the tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
Let's start today's tutorial with this image.
Today I will work with this image only to use it as an example.
"""Before we start to work with selection, I think you should understand a bit about what selections really are."""
This square is a selection and this part is outside of the selection.
"""These moving lines, here, are the border of the selection."""
The GIMP people call a selection as a channel;
"""a channel like Red, Green or Blue or an Alpha channel which controls the transparency."""
"""Outside of the selection, the value of this channel is zero"""
and inside it's 255 and between them is the border and between them there can be values lower than 255 and higher than zero.
"""So, 'changing a selection' or 'making a selection' is changing some numbers."""
"""And now, let's have a look at how to make a selection."""
"""For de-selecting a selection, there are 2 ways."""
"""First way is, go to Select and None."""
You can also use the key combination of Shift + Ctrl+ A and get rid of a selection.
"""Now, select the Rectangle Select Tool  and look into the options dialog."""
"""On the top, there are four choices."""
The first one is Replace the current selection.
"""So, I select different areas here and you can see that when I select a new area, the old selection is deleted."""
The second option is Add to the current selection.
"""By selecting that option, I can select different areas in the image and get a quite complicated selection."""
"""And if I go to my colour tabs and just pull the colour over to the selection, you can see, all the selected areas are filled with that colour and the area which is selected and not connected is also filled."""
"""So, adding something to a selection holds every selection as one, even if there is no connection between the parts of the selection."""
It's a bit complicated.
Press Ctrl + Z to undo the filling and shift + Ctrl + A to de-select everything and back to my options dialog.
"""Now, select a square here and select Subtract from the current Selection."""
I Select this area but nothing happens.
"""But when I select these areas, you can see that the edge is cut out."""
"""You can see that the frame of selection stays there and when I move it, changes can be made."""
"""So, the last selection you made can be changed until you click into another place to get a new selection. You can change your work all the time."""
Now the last option is Intersect with the current selection.
Let's try that.
I select a rectangle here and the area outside it is not selected and selections which were done before are deleted.
And only selection in this rectangle is kept.
I can also modify this rectangle until I have the area selected that I wanted.
"""So now, we have covered four modes i.e. Replace, Add, Subtract and Intersect."""
You can replace a selection by just clicking.
Adding can be done by Click and Shift.
"""So, let's try that. I press the shift key and then by clicking I start adding new selections."""
"""And, when I press the shift key and mouse key, a plus sign appears."""
"""Now, if I want to subtract the selection, I can press the Ctrl key and now I press the mouse key and start to move; you can see a minus sign."""
"""So, now, I can subtract the selection."""
"""And for intersection, Shift, Ctrl should be pressed together and then select an area for intersecting."""
If you memorize these key combinations you can select the area faster.
And the same keys are used by the other selection tool.
"""So, you will just have to learn them only once."""
"""Shift, Ctrl, A, disable all the selections and bring back to my normal mode and now let's start with other stuff here."""
Next option is Feather edges and when I select it you get another option here as Radius count.
"""So, I increase it a bit and select an area."""
"""Now you can see here, there is rounded corner."""
I don’t want rounded corners here.
"""Just to show you what has happened, I will fill this with black and I zoom into the image."""
"""You can see, here is  black colour in the middle and it fades out near the border and these margin ends are running in-between the real black and the original image and here, the value of selection is 128."""
"""So, the half black colour fades inside the selection and half outside."""
The margin end is the only real border of your selection when you have a hard selection.
Feather edges is a nice option to get smooth selections.
"""With Feather selection, you can get a less sharp scene and it is easier that way."""
Technically minded people call Feather selection as Gaussian Blur and the Radius I selected here is the radius of the Gaussian Blur.
The next option is Rounded corners.
It’s a rectangle with rounded corner and you can set the radius of the rounded corners.
Here is the round part and these margins are the straight parts.
Here is the next option Antialiasing.
This option sets the corner painting.
I just fill this selection with black and now I go back to my selection tool and I de-select Antialiasing and make another selection and fill this also with black.
"""So, select the zoom tool and de-select all selections with Shift + Ctrl + A and zoom into this area."""
"""And here, the edge is without antialiasing and it is either filled with black or not filled with black."""
"""And here, you can see the stair of grays."""
Here you can see the smooth corner without jaggies and that’s called antialiasing.
This selection does not have a rounded corner but it is series of steps.
"""And, when I go back to 100% zoom, I can see here are jaggies and it's not smooth but here it is smooth corners and you can easily try it for yourself."""
"""So, if you want to have smooth corners then select Antialiasing."""
"""And if you want to have these gray tones, in here, then deselect that option."""
"""So, I select that option and there is a sub option called Expand from centre."""
I select it and start working with it.
"""So, I place a point here and I start pulling my selection from here."""
"""You can see, it grows from that point and this point is always in the middle of the selection."""
"""When I de-select that option, I can pull selection here and the position of the corner changes according to my selection."""
There is a key code for this.
"""When I click at this point and press Ctrl,  I have a selection from center and the selection expands from center."""
"""And when I release the Ctrl key, the selection vanishes."""
"""When I press the Ctrl key before I press the mouse button, I can subtract a selection  but when I first press the mouse key and then the Ctrl key I get selection from centre."""
"""The next option here is Fixed aspect ratio and I can have here preselected aspect ratio as 1 by 1 and when I draw, it will always be a square."""
I can select here 2 by 3 (2:3) and I always get a selection in 2 by 3 ratio and switching to 3 by 2 (3:2) gives me a selection in landscape mode.
There is another way to create a perfect square.
I start the selection at this point and pull and then press shift.
Now the Fixed aspect ratio is selected with preselected value here.
"""And this is a fast way, so I can select areas with aspect ratios that I want and by just pressing shift."""
"""The next option is Highlight and when I use that, the area that is not selected is gray and all the area that is selected is white."""
And this concerns only the current selection so let's de-select it and look at other options.
"""Here you can set these values by hand and if you click on Fix here, then I can't change the size of the selection."""
"""But if I want to have set width two pixels less and height one pixel more, so it fine tunes the selection."""
I can move the selection a little bit to the right by increasing the value of X which is the point of origin.
"""And when I click on Fix, I can move the whole selection."""
"""So, the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ values are the point of origin of the left top point and with Fix button, I can block the movement."""
The next option is the Guides.
I can select a Centre line which shows me where the middle point of the selection is.
I can have the Rule of thirds which is used for the graphic work or I can have the Golden sections which is similar to the Rule of thirds.
On the bottom is Auto Shrink Selection and Shrink merged.
Auto Shrink Selection is not very useful.
"""But Shrink merged is an option which if selected, the algorithm looks at all the layers and if de-selected only the layer that you are working on, is taken into consideration."""
"""Before having a recap of these options, we will talk about Ellipse selection."""
"""So, de-select all the selections by pressing Shift + ctrl + A."""
"""On the top, you get the same options like Replace current selection, Add to the selection with Shift key before clicking and Subtract with Ctrl key before clicking and Intersect with Shift and Ctrl key befor"
Antialiasing is again for smooth edges.
It is more important with ellipse than with rectangles because ellipses are always round.
"""Feather edges, the same option as in rectangle."""
"""When I fill it with black , you can see a smooth gradient between black and white and these margin ends are in-between black and white."""
"""Expand from center also works the same with the Ctrl key, after clicking the mouse button."""
"""Fixed aspect ratio is also the same. After clicking the mouse button, you get a perfect circle with aspect ratio 1 by 1 (1:1)."""
"""Now, let's come to the last tool I want to show you for today and that's the Free Select tool."""
"""When I select that tool, I see the same options here and also the keys work the same for Add, Replace, Subtract and Intersect."""
It has only two further options i.e Antialiasing and Feather edges with same functions.
"""Here, I get the Radius of the circle and I de-select it now."""
I select this lower part of the leaf to show you as example.
And I click into the image where I want to start the selection and draw a line and follow the border of the leaf.
"""So, now I have selected this area."""
I zoom into the image to do fine tuning.
"""And in my selection dialog, I select Add to the current selection and start adjusting the selection."""
The algorithm looks for the shortest way to the point where you started the selection.
"""For making the selection easy, I can use a Quick Mask."""
"""On the bottom left corner is the option, Toggle Quick Mask and I toggle that and you can see now my whole image is red."""
It is a bit confusing option because the area which I have selected and the area which is not selected are shown in red.
"""So, I go to the toggle and right clicking on it gives me Configure Colour and Opacity and here I can set a color, so I set it to blue."""
Now the area which is selected is Red and all the area is blue.
"""And now, I select a pen and start painting the selected area but before that I change the foreground and background colour  with the key ’X’."""
And now I start to paint.
"""And when I over-paint the border, I can paint with the background colour."""
"""For painting, I should select the right size of the brush."""
"""And when I untoggle the mask, you can see, here is the mistake in selection and here also."""
"""So, I select the toggle and correct the mistakes."""
Fixed.
"""So, the Quick Mask is an easy way to get a complicated selection right."""
You can use the Quick Mask selection as a tool.
You can change the opacity of the mask and now you can hardly see the parts which are not selected.
50% opacity is the right amount in most of the cases.
You can choose a colour of your choice for the unselected areas.
There is another option here called Mask Selected Areas.
It has just the opposite effect of the Quick Mask.
"""So now, the selected area is painted blue and this looks better in this case here."""
"""And when you de-select the Quick Mask, you can see your selection."""
"""So now, let's pretend that I have made a perfect selection here and I want to save the selection for the next time to work and don't want to loose it."""
Just go to Select and Save to Channel because selections are basically channels.
I save it as Mask1 and it will be stored with the ’XCF’ file.
"""So now, I can de-select everything with Shift + Ctrl + A."""
"""Select another part and when I go back to my selection here, I can add to the selection or subtract from selection or even intersect with selection and my selection is back here."""
"""So, if you want to save that, just go to Select and Save to Channel. Good Bye."""
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Linux File System.
I am using Linux Operating system.
We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands.
"""If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial on the following website http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Also note that linux is case sensitive.
All the commands used in this tutorial are in lower case unless otherwise mentioned.
"""In Linux, almost everything is a file."""
"""So, what is a file? In real life, we know that a file is where we store our documents and papers."""
"""Similarly, in Linux a file is a container for storing information."""
"""Next, what is a directory?"""
A directory can be understood as a collection of files and other (sub)directories.
A directory helps us in organizing our files in a systematic manner.
This is like what we call folders in Windows.
It allows different users to have their own directories with their files which others cannot access or modify.
"""Also, if there are no directories, all the files on the system need to have unique names which would be very difficult to maintain."""
These definitions of files and directories are good to get a general feel about them; they are not entirely accurate.
"""As well as its contents, a file has a name and some properties or “administrative information” that is, the file’s creation/modification date and its permissions."""
"""Thus,  properties are stored in the file’s inode- a special block of data in the file system that also contains the length of the file and where on the disk it’s stored."""
The system uses the number of the file’s inode ; the directory structure just names the file for our benefit as it's easier for us to remember names than larger numbers.
"""Contrary to its oversimplified definition, a directory does not actually store other files, it itself is a file that holds the inode numbers and names of other files."""
"""In fact, in Linux there are three kinds of files:"""
"""Regular Files or Ordinary files: It contains only data, as a stream of characters."""
Directories: As we just saw in the previous slides.
Device Files: All hardware devices and peripherals are represented as files in Linux.
"""A CD, a Hard disk or even an usb stick, everything is a file in Linux. But why is this so? This helps to read and write these devices in a way similar to that for ordinary files."""
"""All files in Linux are related. In short, all form a family much like we do."""
"""A directory containing say- some files and sub-directories, will have a parent – child relationship with each other. This gives rise to the Linux File System Tree."""
At the top is the root( denoted by a frontslash /). It contains all the other files and directories.
"""This also helps in easy navigation from one file or directory to other, if we know the correct path."""
"""As we work with a Linux file system, it seems that we are moving along this tree."""
One command and there you are... teleported from one place to other.
"""Sounds interesting!! Indeed it is, as we will see."""
"""When we login into the Linux system, we are by default in a home directory."""
"""Now, switch to the terminal."""
"""To see the home directory , type at the command prompt: echo space dollar H-O-M-E in capital and press Enter."""
This gives the path name of our home directory.
We can move around from one directory to other.
"""But, any time we can be in one directory and this directory is known as the current directory or working directory."""
The pwd command helps us to see the current directory. pwd stands for present working directory.
"""Type at the command prompt pwd and press Enter. Now, this is our present working directory."""
We have said that we can move from one directory to other.
But how do we do so? We have the cd command for this purpose.
You have to type the command cd followed by the path name of the directory you want to move to.
Let's again see our current directory by typing pwd at the command prompt and press Enter.
"""So, now we are placed in this directory."""
"""Now, say we want to move to slash usr directory. So, type: cd space slash usr. Remember, here slash in linux means front-slash and press Enter."""
Now lets see our current directory. Type pwd and press Enter.
"""Yes, we have moved to slash usr directory."""
"""The problem here is, the path names can be very long; this is because these are Absolute Path names that enlist the entire path, starting from the root directory."""
"""Instead, we may use Relative path names that begin from the current directory."""
"""Here, we need to know two special characters. dot that represent the current directory and dot dot that represent the parent directory of the current directory."""
"""Now, let us have a brief session on cd command."""
"""The command cd, without any argument, is used to move back to the home directory."""
Type at the command prompt cd and press Enter.
Now check our current directory by the pwd command.
"""So, now we are back in our home directory- /home/gnuhata [slash home slash gnuhata]."""
"""Now, let us move to music directory. Type at the command prompt cd space Music (M in capital) slash and press Enter."""
"""Now check our current directory by the pwd command. pwd and press enter. See, we have moved  /home/gnuhata/Music."""
"""Let us go to the parent directory of Music. For that, you have to use cd command with dot dot."""
Type at the command prompt: cd space dot dot and press Enter.
Now check our present directory by typing pwd. We are again in /home/gnuhata.
"""Now, let's try to move to a sub-directory of the current directory using dot."""
Type at the command prompt: cd space dot slash Documents (D in capital) slash. Press Enter.
Check our current directory by typing pwd. We are at-  /home/gnuhata/Documents.
Let me clear the screen by pressing control L. So you can see clearly.
"""To go back to our home directory by cd command, type cd and press Enter."""
Again check our current directory by pwd command. We are back to /home/gnuhata.
We can combine any number of dot dot separated by slash in a relative path.
"""In this slide, we can see the file system hierarchy. Root or slash is at the top. home and bin are two sub-directories under root. username , here the directory named gnuhata, is a sub-directory under home."""
"""So, now we are in /home/gnuhata. Now, how can we go to the bin directory?"""
Type at the command prompt: cd space dot dot slash dot dot slash bin and press Enter.
Check our current directory by the command pwd.  We are at /bin (slash bin).
"""The first """".."""" (dot dot) takes us from /home/gnuhata (slash home slash gnuhata) to /home (slash home)."""
"""The next, takes us from slash home to root."""
"""Now from root or slash, we have moved to /bin directory."""
Go back to our home directory by the command cd.
"""To create a directory, we use the mkdir command."""
You have to type the command and the name of directory to be created and a directory would be created under the current directory.
"""To create a directory named testdir, type the command: mkdir space testdir and press Enter."""
This creates the testdir directory successfully.
"""Note that, there is no explicit notification of successful directory creation or removal."""
"""If you do not get any error message, it denotes successful execution."""
We can also use the relative or absolute path name to create a directory anywhere in the tree provided we have the permission to do so and a directory by that name does not already exist.
This process can be used for making multiple directories or even a hierarchy of directories.
Type: mkdir space test1 space test2 and press Enter. This will make two directories named test1 and test2 under the present directory.
"""Type: """"'mkdir space testtree space testtree slash test3'""""."""
This will make a directory testtree and another directory test3 which is a sub-directory under testtree.
"""So, we have created four directories namely testdir, test1, test2 and testtree in the current directory, out of which first three are empty and the last one contains a sub-directory namely test3."""
Similar to the mkdir command is the rmdir command which is used for removing a directory or directories.
The command rmdir space test1 removes the test1 directory successfully.
"""A directory can be removed only if you are its owner, your current directory is hierarchically above the directory to be removed and the directory is empty."""
"""Now type at the command prompt: '""""cd space testtree slash test3""""'."""
"""So, we are now in test3 directory which is a sub-directory under testtree."""
Let's try to remove the testdir directory by typing the command rmdir space testdir. Press Enter.
We see it can't be done because the current directory is not hierarchically above the directory to be removed.
"""So, we have to go to the directory which is hierarchically above testdir directory."""
"""Type: """"'cd space dot dot""""' and press Enter."""
"""Now, go back to our parent directory by typing the command """"'cd space dot dot'""""."""
"""Now, again try the previous command."""
"""Type: """"rmdir space testdir"""". Press Enter."""
"""The testdir directory is successfully deleted. Note that, testdir directory was also empty."""
"""Multiple directories or a hierarchy of directories can be removed at once. So, try to delete the testtree directory along with its sub-directory test3."""
Type at the command prompt: rmdir space testtree space testtree slash test3 press Enter.
"""See, it is giving the error message that 'testree' directory cannot be removed because 'testtree' is not empty."""
But one thing which you may miss is that testtree slash test3 has been deleted as it was empty.
"""To check that, type at the command prompt: cd space testtree and press Enter."""
"""Now, type ls and press Enter. See, the directory contains nothing. So, 'test3' was deleted."""
"""So, in this linux tutorial we have learnt about Linux Files and directories and how to work with Linux Directories. See them, move between them, make them, remove them."""
"""This brings me to the end of this tutorial. Spoken Tutorials are part of the """"Talk to a Teacher"""" project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""

Hi everyone. Welcome to the tutorial on Integrating an Applet in a Web Application.
The application that you build in this tutorial shows you how to build and deploy applets in the Netbeans IDE.
"""If this is the first time you are using Netbeans, please view the tutorial -"""
Introduction to Netbeans to get started with the IDE.
"""Also, view the tutorials Developing Web Applications and Designing GUIs on Netbeans"""
to get familiarized with the IDE.
All the above tutorials can be viewed on the Spoken Tutorial website.
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System Ubuntu version 11.04 and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1."""
"""In this tutorial, we will:"""
Create an Applet
Run the Applet and
Embed the applet in a web application.
Let us now launch the IDE to create our project.
Go to  File > New Project and create a Java Class Library .
Click Next.
Give your Project a name.
"""I will name my project as  """"SampleApplet""""."""
Set the  Location to any directory on your system.
"""And, click Finish to create your project."""
Let us next create the  Applet Source File.
"""Right-Click on the """"SampleApplet"""" project node"""
and choose Properties to open the Properties window.
Select the desired Source or Binary Format for the project.
This is to make sure if the correct version of the JDK has been chosen.
"""For example- if you choose the latest version of JDK,"""
then the applet might not run on machines that have an older version of the Java browser plugin.
I will select the latest version of JDK since my browser supports the latest version of the java browser plugin.
Click on OK.
Right-Click again on the SampleApplet project node
and select New > Applet.
"""If you do not find the Applet option in this contextual menu, click on Other."""
"""Under Categories, select Java."""
"""And under File Types, select Applet to create an Applet."""
"""Give the Class name as """"Sample"""" and the Package as """"org.me.hello""""."""
Click Finish.
The IDE creates the applet source file in the specified package.
You can expand the Source Packages node in the Projects window to see this.
The Applet source file opens in the Source editor.
Let us now define our applet class.
I have the code for a simple applet
"""that sets the background color to cyan,"""
the foreground color to red
and displays a message that illustrates the order in which the methods in the applet
"""i.e. the init() method, the start() method, and the paint() methods are called when the applet starts up."""
I will now copy the entire code on my clipboard and paste it over the existing code in the IDE.
Right-Click on the Sample.java file in the Projects window
and choose Run File from the contextual menu.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Add a Budget and allocate Funds.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to- Add a Budget,  Make a duplicate Budget and Allocate Funds."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04 and Koha version 16.05"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have Koha installed on your system."""
You should also have Admin access in Koha.
Please refer to the Koha spoken tutorial series on this website for more details.
Let us go ahead and learn how to add a Budget.
"""Before we begin, let us understand what are Budgets. Budgets are used for tracking accounting values related to Acquisitions."""
A Budget must be defined before a fund can be created.
For example-  Create a Budget for the current year 2017.
"""Split it into Funds for different areas such as Books, Journals and/or  Databases."""
"""Please note,Budgets can either be created - from scratch or by duplicating any of the previous years’ Budget"""
"""or, by duplicating the immediate previous year’s Budget or, by closing the immediate previous year’s Budget."""
"""As mentioned in earlier tutorials, login with the Superlibrarian username Bella and her password."""
On the 'Koha' Home page click on Acquisitions.
"""From  the options on the left side, click on Budgets."""
"""Now, click on the tab New budget."""
"""First, we have to choose the time period for this Budget."""
"""Budget can be created for- an Academic year, Fiscal year or  a Quarter year etc."""
I will create the Budget for a Fiscal year.
Then choose the Start and End dates.
I will select- Start date: as 04/01/2016 (MM/DD/YYYY) End date: as 03/31/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY)
Next we have to give a description for our Budget.
"""This will help us to identify it later, at the time of ordering."""
"""Here, I will type: Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I."""
"""In the Amount box, we need to enter the amount for this particular Budget."""
"""This is the total amount of money we are planning to spend, in the given period,  for the Spoken Tutorial Library."""
Note that this field accepts only numerals and decimals.
Special characters and symbols are not allowed.
"""The Amount we enter, has to be as per the Budget approved for that library."""
"""Here, I will add Rs. 5,00,000/- as the Amount."""
"""Next, click on Make a budget active."""
"""On doing so, the budget becomes usable when placing orders in the Acquisitions module."""
"""And this remains so, even if the order is placed after the Budget End date."""
This will also allow us to record orders that were placed in the previous year’s Budget.
Next is the check-box for Lock budget
which means Funds cannot be modified later by the library staff.
I will leave this check-box blank.
"""After all the entries are done, click on the Save button at the bottom of the page."""
A new page Budgets administration opens up.
"""Here, we can see the details that were added earlier in the +New Budget page."""
The details visible on this page are -
"""description under the tab Budget name, Start date:, End date:, Total amount:, Actions:."""
"""We can also edit, delete or duplicate a particular Budget as required."""
"""To do so, click on the tab Actions located at the extreme right of that Budget name."""
"""From the drop-down, select any of the options: Edit, Delete, Duplicate, Close or Add fund."""
Let us learn how to allocate funds for a Fiscal year.
"""On the same table, click on the particular Budget Name to which the fund has to be allocated."""
I will click on Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase 1.
A new page Funds for 'Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase 1' opens.
"""Just above the Funds for 'Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase 1’, locate and click on the tab New."""
"""From the drop-down, select New fund for Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase 1."""
"""In the new page that opens up, fill in the details such as: Fund code: Books Fund name: Books fund"""
Enter the Amount as: 25000 Warning at (%): 10
"""For Warning at (amount):, as I have already filled in Warning at (%), I will skip this field."""
I will also skip the fields Owner: and Users.
"""For Library:, select Spoken Tutorial Library from the drop- down."""
I will leave Restrict access to: as it is.
I will leave Statistic 1 done on and Statistic 2 done on: blank.
"""After all the details are filled, click on the Submit button at the bottom of the page."""
"""All the Fund allocation details pertaining to the particular library, now appear in a tabular form."""
"""From the options on the left side, click on Budgets."""
I will now show how to duplicate a budget.
"""But before that, we must first learn why we should duplicate a Budget."""
"""Suppose the Budget amount and amount of Funds is same for the next financial year- in that case, we can simply duplicate the Budget."""
This will help the Library staff to save a lot of time and effort.
"""To do so, click on the tab Actions located at the extreme right of that Budget name."""
"""From the drop-down, select Duplicate."""
A new page Duplicate Budget opens.
Enter the new Start date and End date. I will enter the dates for the next year’s Budget-
Start date: as 04/01/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY) End date: as 03/31/2018 (MM/DD/YYYY)
Next is Description.
"""Note that Description details should be such that it can be easily identified with a particular Budget later. Koha, by default, shows the previously entered description."""
"""But, I will rename it as Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018, Phase II. You may enter something relevant for your library."""
"""In the field for Change amounts by:, enter the percentage that needs to be taken out from the previous years’ Budget .  Or, carry forward the same amount."""
"""Recall, that an amount of Rs 5,00,000/- was approved for Spoken Tutorial Library."""
"""Hence, I will enter -20% (minus 20 percent) to take out an amount of Rs 1,00,000/-"""
"""The next field is If amounts changed, round to a multiple of: I will leave the field blank."""
"""Going further, we have the check-box for Mark the original Budget as inactive."""
"""On doing so, the original Budget can no longer be used. Again, I will leave this box blank."""
"""Lastly, we have the check-box for Set all funds to zero."""
Check this box if you want the new Budget to have the same Fund structures as the previous Budget.
But please note- no allocations will be allowed until you manually enter an amount in the Fund. I will leave this also as blank for now.
"""After all the details are entered, click on Save changes at the bottom of the page."""
The details entered for the duplicate budget Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018 Phase II appears on the Budgets administration page.
You may now log out from the Koha Superlibrarian Account

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Strings  in C and C++.
In this tutorial we will learn:
What is a string.
Declaration of a string.
Initialization of a string.
Few examples on string.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04 gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 ."
Let us start with the introduction to strings.
String is a sequence of characters that is treated as a single data item.
Size of string = length of string + 1.
Let me tell you how to declare a string.
The syntax for this is
"""char, name of string and size."""
"""char is the data type, name of the string is the string name, and we can give the size here."""
Eg: here we have declared a character string names with size 10.
Now we will see an example.
"""I have already typed the program,  I will open it."""
Note that our file name is string.c
"""In this program, we will take a string as an input from the user and print it."""
Let me explain the code now.
These are our header files.
"""Here string.h includes the declarations, functions, constants of string handling utilities."""
"""Whenever we work on string functions, we should include this header file."""
This is our main() function.
Here we are declaring the string strname with size  30.
Here we are accepting a string from the user.
"""To read a string, we can use scanf() function with format specifier %s."""
We are using the caret sign and  to include the spaces with the string.
Then we print the string.
And this is our return statement.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute the program.
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space string.c space -o space str and press Enter ."
"""To execute, type ./str  (dot slash str)."""
Now press Enter.
Here it is displayed as Enter the string .
"""I will type """"Talk To A Teacher""""."""
The output is displayed as  The string is Talk To A Teacher.
Now let us switch back to our slides.
Until now we discussed about the declaration of a string.
Now we are going to discuss how to initialize the string.
"""The syntax for this is,"""
char var_name[size] = “string”;
"""Eg: Here we have declared a character string  “names” with size 10 and the string is “Priya”"""""""
"""Another syntax is,"""
"""char var_name[ ] = {'S', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g'}  within single quotes."""
"""eg: char names[10] = {'P', 'r', 'i', 'y', 'a'}  in single quotes."""
Let me show you how to use the first syntax with an example.
Switch back to our Editor. We will use the same example.
"""First, press shift, ctrl and s keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with the name stringinitialize.
We are going to initialize the string.
"""Hence, at the 5th line, type"""
"""Now, click on Save ."""
"""Now remove these two lines, as we are only going to print the string."""
Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type gcc space stringinitialize.c space -o space str2"
Here we have str2 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter str for the file string.c.
Now press Enter.
"""To execute, type ./str2"""
"""The output is displayed as  """"The string is Spoken-Tutorial""""."""
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across .
Come back to our program.
"""Suppose, here we type the spelling of string as sting."""
Now click on Save.
Let us execute.Come back to our terminal.
Now compile as before.
We see an fatal error.
sting.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
Come back to our program.
This is because the compiler is not able to find the header file with the name sting.h .
Hence it is giving an error.
Let us fix the error.
Type r here.
Now click on Save. Let us execute again.
Come back to our terminal.
"""Compile as before, execute as before."""
"""Yes, it is working!"""
"""Now, let us see another common error."""
Come back to our program.
"""Suppose, here I will type int in place of char."""
"""Now, click on Save .Let us see what happens."""
Come back to our terminal.
Let me clear the prompt.
Compile as before.
We see an error.
Wide character array initialized from non-wide string .
format %s expects argument of type 'char' but  argument 2 has type 'int' .
This is because we used  %s as the format specifier for string.
And we are initializing it with an integer data type.
Let us fix the error.
Type char here.
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
"""Compile as before, execute as before."""
"""Yes, it is working!"""
Now we will see how to execute the same program in C++.
Let me open our file string.c.
We will edit the code here.
"""First, press shift, ctrl and S keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with an extension .cpp (dot cpp).
and click on Save.
Now we will change the header file as  iostream.
Include the using statement.
Now we will delete this declaration.
And will declare a string variable.
Type string space strname and a semicolon.
Click on Save.
Replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
Delete the closing bracket here.
"""Delete the scanf statement and type getline opening bracket closing bracket, within the brackets type (cin, strname) ."""
"""At the end, type a semicolon."""
"""Now again, replace the printf statement with the cout statement."""
Delete the format specifier and  .
Now delete the comma.
"""Type two opening angle brackets, delete the bracket here."""
Type two opening angle brackets and within the double quotes type  .
And click on Save.
Here we have declared a string variable 'strname' .
"""Since we do not use the format specifier in C++, the compiler should know that 'strname' is a string variable."""
Here we use getline to extract the characters from the input sequence.
It stores them as a string.
Now let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space string.cpp space -o space str3 and press Enter."
"""To execute, type ./str3 (dot slash str3)."""
Press Enter. It is displayed as Enter the string.
I will enter as Talk To A Teacher .
Now press Enter.
"The output is displayed as ""The string is Talk To A Teacher"""
We can see that the output is similar to our C code.
Now come back to our slides. Let us summarize.
In this tutorial we learnt:
Strings and Declaration of a string
eg: char strname[30]
"Initialization of a string eg: char strname[30] = ""Talk To A Teacher"""
"As an assignment, write a program to print a string using the 2nd syntax."

Hello everyone.Welcome to this tutorial on Writing Sequence Files.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn: * How to create Sequence Record Objects"""
Write sequences files
Convert between file formats
"""And, sort records in a file by length."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with"""
undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics
and basic Python programming.
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: * Ubuntu OS version 14.10"""
Python version 2.7.8
Ipython interpretor version 2.3.0 and * Biopython version 1.64.
We have earlier learnt about parse and read functions to read contents of a file.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to use write function to write sequences to a file."""
"""And, use Convert function for inter-conversion between various file formats."""
Let me now demonstrate how to use write function.
Here is a text file with a protein sequence.
The sequence shown here is insulin protein.
The file also has information such as GI accession number and also description.
We will now create a file for this sequence in FASTA format.
The first step is to create sequence record object.
More information about Sequence Record Objects:
It is the basic data type for the sequence input/output interface.
"""In sequence record object, a sequence is associated with higher level features such as identifiers and descriptions."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and t keys simultaneously ."""
"""At the prompt, type: ipython, press Enter."""
"""At the prompt, type the following lines:"""
from Bio dot Seq module import Seq class.
from Bio dot SeqRecord module import Sequence Record class
"""Next, from Bio dot Alphabet module import generic protein class."""
"""Next, I will save the sequence record object in a variable record1."""
"""Copy the sequence, id and description from the text file and paste it in the respective lines on the terminal."""
Press Enter.
"""To view the output, type: record1."""
Press Enter.
The output shows the insulin protein sequence as sequence record object.
It shows the sequence along with id and description.
We will use write function to convert the above sequence record object to a FASTA file.
Import SeqIO module from Bio package.
"""Next, type the command line with a write function to convert the sequence object to FASTA file."""
The write function takes 3 arguments.
The first one is the variable storing the sequence record object.
The second is the file name to write the FASTA file.
The third is the file format to write. Press Enter.
"""The Output shows one, that is, we have converted one sequence record object to a FASTA file."""
"""The file in FASTA format is saved in the home folder as """"example.fasta""""."""
"""Let me warn you,the output will over-write any pre-existing file of the same name."""
"""To view the file, navigate to the file in the home folder."""
Open this file in a text editor.
The protein sequence is now in FASTA format.
Close the text editor.
Many bioinformatics tools take different input file formats.
"""So, sometimes there is a need to inter-convert between sequence file formats."""
We can do file conversions using convert function in SeqIO module.
"""For demonstration, I will convert a GenBank file to a FASTA file."""
Have a GenBank file in my home folder.
Let me open this in a text editor.
The file contains HIV genome in GenBank format.
"""This GenBank file has descriptions of all the genes in the genome, in the first part of the file."""
It is followed by a complete genome sequence.
Close the text editor. Type the following lines on the terminal.
Here the convert function converts the complete genome sequence present in the GenBank file to FASTA file. Press Enter.
The new file in the FASTA format is now saved as HIV.fasta in the home folder.
Navigate to the file and open in the text editor.
"""Even though we can convert the file formats easily using convert function, it has limitations."""
Writing some formats requires information which other file formats don’t contain.
"""For example: We can convert a GenBank file to a FASTA file, we can't do the reverse."""
"""Similarly, we can turn a FASTQ file into a FASTA file but can’t do the reverse."""
"""For more information regarding convert function, type the help command."""
Press 'q' on the key board to get back to the prompt.
We can also extract individual genes from the HIV genome in GenBank format.
These individual genes can be saved in FASTA or any other formats.
"""For this, type the following code at the prompt."""
"""This code will write all individual CDS gene sequences, their ids and name of the gene in a file."""
The file is saved as “HIV_geneseq.fasta” in your home folder. Press Enter.
"""Using Biopython tools, we can sort the records in a file by length."""
"""Here, I have opened a FASTA file “hemoglobin.fasta” which has six records."""
Each record is of a different length.
Type the following lines to arrange the longest record first.
"""The new file with the sorted sequences will be saved as """"sorted_hemoglobin.fasta"""" in your home folder."""
"""For short records first, reverse the arguments in the records.sort command line."""
"""Let's summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt :* to create Sequence Record Objects"""
Write sequence files using write function of Sequence Input/Output module.
Convert between sequence file formats using convert function.
"""And, sort records in a file by length."""
For the assignment:
"""Extract the gene """"HIV1gp3"""" at positions 4587 to 5165 from the genomic sequence of HIV."""
The file “HIV.gb” is included in the code files of this tutorial.
Your completed assignment will have the following code.

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on  Desktop Customization in Ubuntu Linux 16.04 operating system.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the Launcher and how to: remove and add applications in the Launcher,"""
"""Use multiple Desktops, change the theme of the Desktop,"""
"""internet connectivity,  Sound settings,"""
Time and Date settings  and switch to other user accounts.
"""For this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System."""
Let's begin with the Launcher.
Launcher  is the default left-side panel in the Ubuntu Linux Desktop which has some default applications.
The Launcher makes it easy to access frequently used applications.
"""So, we can launch a program by clicking on its desktop shortcut on the Launcher."""
"""By default, the Launcher has some applications."""
Let us learn to customize the Launcher based on our requirements.
"""For my regular work, I need applications like Terminal, LibreOffice Writer, gedit and so on."""
Let's add these applications to the Launcher.
"""Before doing that, I will remove some of the applications which I don't want."""
"""Say, I wish to remove the Amazon application from the Launcher."""
"""Go to the Amazon application icon, then right-click and select Unlock from Launcher."""
You can see that the Amazon application icon has been removed from the Launcher.
"""In the same way, we can remove all the shortcuts which we do not use frequently."""
"""I have removed some applications from the Launcher, as you can see here."""
"""Now, I will add the Terminal shortcut to the Launcher."""
"""Click on Dash home, at the top of the Launcher."""
"""In the search bar, type “terminal”. Click on the Terminal icon to open it."""
You can see the Terminal icon on the Launcher.
"""To fix the Terminal icon on the Launcher, first right-click on it. Then select Lock to Launcher."""
"""Another way to fix application shortcuts on the Launcher, is by dragging and dropping. I will demonstrate this now."""
"""Open Dash Home and in the search bar, type gedit."""
Drag the gedit  icon onto the Launcher.
"""Now, drop the gedit icon on the Launcher. You can see the gedit shortcut is now added to the Launcher."""
This is how we can add shortcuts on the Launcher.
The next important feature in Ubuntu Linux OS is multiple workspace or Desktop.
Sometimes we may be working on multiple applications
and we may find it difficult to switch from one application to another.
"""To make it more convenient, we can use Workspace Switcher."""
Let’s come back to the Desktop.
"""In Ubuntu 16.04,  multiple workspaces won’t appear by default."""
"""To enable it, click on the System Settings, and then on Appearance."""
"""In the Appearance window, click on Behavior tab."""
"""Here, select Enable workspaces option. This will enable the multiple workspaces icon on the Launcher."""
Close this window.
"""On the Launcher, locate Workspace Switcher icon and click on it."""
It shows 4 quadrants with 4 Desktops.
"""By default, the top-left Desktop is selected."""
That is the Desktop in which we are currently working.
"""Now, let’s select the second Desktop by double-clicking on it."""
I will open the terminal here by clicking on the terminal icon in the Launcher.
"""Now, click on the Workspace Switcher again."""
You can see the terminal on the second Workspace and our Desktop on the first.
"""In this way, you can work on multiple Desktops."""
Let’s come back to the first Desktop now.
Trash is another important icon on the Launcher.
"""Trash contains all the deleted files and folders. In case we delete a file accidentally, we can restore it from Trash."""
"""To demonstrate this, I will delete Hello.txt which is on my Desktop."""
Right-click on the file and click on the option Move to Trash.
"""To restore it, just click on the Trash icon in the Launcher. The Trash folder opens."""
"""Select the file, right-click on it and click on Restore option."""
Close the Trash folder window and come back to the Desktop.
"""We can see the file which we deleted earlier, is now restored."""
"""To delete a file permanently from your system, first select it and then press Shift+Delete keys."""
A dialog box is asking “Are you sure you want to permanently delete Hello.txt?” Click on the Delete button.
Click on the Trash icon once again.
"""We cannot find the file in the Trash folder, as it is permanently deleted from our system."""
Aren't you bored of seeing the same theme of the Desktop? Let's change it.
"""Go to the Launcher and select System settings, and then click on Appearance."""
The Appearance window opens up.
"""Here, under Themes tab, we have many pre-installed themes."""
Play with these themes as per your preference.
"""As soon as you click on any one, you can see that changes get applied on the Desktop."""
Click on the tiny X icon to close the window.
"""Now, we'll see some icons available at the top right corner of the Desktop."""
First one is Internet connectivity.
Connection is established if you are connected to any Lan or Wifi network.
You can see these over here.
You can select the network which you have access to.
"""To Enable or Disable the network, check or uncheck the Enable Networking option."""
We can also edit the networks using Edit Connections option.
Next icon is that of Sound.
You can see a slider here.
"""This helps us to increase or decrease the audio level, as per our choice."""
We can further adjust the sound level of our system by clicking on Sound Settings. Explore the settings in this window on your own.
"""Next icon is Time & Date. If we click on this icon, the calendar opens up."""
"""We can see the current date, month and year."""
"""Arrow buttons allow us to move to other months and years, as per our choice."""
We can edit the date and time by clicking on Time & Date Settings.
Explore this option further on your own.
"""Next, click on the wheel or Power icon."""
Here we can see some shortcut options along with Log Out and Shut Down options.
We can also see all the user accounts available in our system.
We can switch to whichever user account we wish to by clicking on that particular user.
With this we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarise.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about the Launcher and how to: remove and add applications in the Launcher,"""

"""The script for this tutorial has been contributed by the Spoken Tutorial team."
Welcome to this  spoken tutorial on Logical Operators in Java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn about the logical operators."""
How to check for multiple expressions using logical operators and  how to override precedence using parentheses.
"""For this tutorial we are using: Ubuntu 11.10,  JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge on relational operators in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown."""
Logical operators are used to check for multiple conditions.
Here is a list of the available logical operators in Java.
"""and, or, not. We shall look into each of them in detail. Switch to Eclipse."""
"""Here, we have the 'Eclipse IDE' and  the skeleton required for the rest of the code."""
We have created a class LogicalOperators and added the main method.
Let us create some variables.
boolean b ;
We shall store the result of conditions in 'b';
int age is equal to 11;
int weight is equal to 42;
We have the age and weight of a person.
We shall check if the person is below 18yrs of age and is at least 40kgs.
Let us see how to do so.
b is equal to age less than 18 ampersand ampersand weight greater than equal to 40;
This statement has two expressions and a double ampersand symbol in between.
It checks if age is less than 18 and also if weight is greater than or equal to 40.
This operation is called the and operation.
Let us now print the value of 'b'.
System dot out dot println(b);
Save and Run .
"""As we can see, the output is true because both the conditions are satisfied."""
"""Now, let us change the weight so that one condition is not satisfied and re-run the code."""
Change 42 to 32.
Save and Run.
The output now is false.
This is because the condition age less than 18 is  satisfied
but the condition  weight  greater than or equal to 40 is not satisfied.
The AND operation requires both the conditions to be true for the result to be true.
Therefore we get false as our output.
"""This way, using a  double ampersand symbol we can perform  an AND operation."""
Let's say we have age and weight and it is enough if only one of the conditions is satisfied.
"""In other words, we need to see if the first condition  or the second condition is true."""
It is done using the OR operation.
Let us first remove the earlier condition.
And  type:
age less than or equal to 15 pipe pipe weight less than or equal to 30
There are two conditions and a double pipe symbol in between.
This statement checks if at least one of the given two conditions is satisfied.
Let us run the code to see the output. Save and run.
We see that the output is true.
This is because an OR operation does not need both the conditions to be true like the AND operation.
It needs at least one condition to be true.
"""So, although the condition for weight is not satisfied, since the condition for age is satisfied"""
we get the output as true.
"""Now, let us change the age in  such a way that both the conditions are false and see the result."""
change 11 to 17.
Now the output is false because both the conditions are not satisfied.
"""This way, we use a double PIPE symbol to do an OR operation."""
"""Now, let us say we need to check for people who are older than 15 and with weight more than 30kilos."""
"""In other words, we need to check the exact opposite of the condition we just did."""
"""In such situations, we use the NOT operation."""
"""First, enclose the condition in parentheses."""
And  add an exclamation mark before the condition.
"""By using an exclamation mark, we check for the exact opposite of the condition inside the parentheses."""
"""Since the earlier output was false, now it must be   true. Let us see."""
"""As we can see, the output is the opposite of earlier one."""
"""This way, by using the exclamation mark we perform the NOT operation. Now, let us say we want people  younger than 15."""
Or people younger than 18  and  lighter than 40kilos.
Let us see how would we go about this condition.
Remove the earlier condition and type:
age less than 15
OR age less than 18
AND weight less than 40;
"""As we can see, the condition itself is confusing."""
"""Moreover, we do not know if the OR operation will be performed first or the AND operation."""
It depends on the precedence of operators.
"""In such situations, we use parentheses to overwrite the precedence and also make the condition clear."""
So let us add the parentheses.
"""Let us run the code,  save, run."""
"""Now, although the first condition which is age less than 15 is not satisfied,"""
the second condition which is
age less than 18 and weight less than 40 is satisfied.
"""Therefore, the output is true."""
"""As a rule, use parentheses to avoid ambiguity and make the expressions clear."""
And  this is how we use the logical operators to check for multiple conditions.
This brings us to the end of the tutorial.
"""We have learnt about logical operators, how to check for multiple expressions using logical operators and"""
how to override the precedence using parentheses.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial,"""
find out if the two expressions shown are equivalent?

Welcome to Meet the GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
The GIMP is a very powerful image manipulation program.
"""In this first tutorial, I want to give  you a small tour of GIMP and its features."""
I will briefly demonstrate you how to prepare an image for the web.
I will give detailed explanation in future tutorials.
"""To open an image, I will just drag and drop the image on to the tool box."""
And here it is!
Let’s have a look at this image.
I want to make this image ready for the web.
Let's see what I can do with it.
"""First, the image is tilted; so I have to rotate it a bit."""
Then I want to crop it to remove this part - the back of a person.
The 3rd thing I want to do is to bring in more colors and contrast.
I also want to re-size the image because now its nearly 4000 pixels wide which is far too much.
And then I want to sharpen it and save it as a JPEG image.
Let’s start with rotating.
I zoom into the part of the image where it is most obvious that the image is tilted. You can see it here.
"""By the way, you can move around in the image by pressing Space and just moving the cursor."""
And now I choose the Rotate tool by clicking here.
"""In the Rotate tool, there are some options set by default, to values suited for graphical work and not for photographic work."""
"""So, here Direction is set to Normal (Forward) but I will set it to Corrective (Backward)."""
"""I check if I have the best Interpolation. So, that's fine."""
"""And in the Preview,  I choose Grid instead of the Image."""
I shall increase the no. of grid lines by moving the slider. You will see it soon.
"""Now I will click on the image and get a grid, overlaid on the image."""
This grid is straight.
And I can rotate it and GIMP will rotate the image in the same direction in the Corrective mode so that the grid is straight again.
Let me demonstrate. I will rotate the grid like this.
I will check the other part of the image to make sure.
Looks good to me.
"""Now, I will click on the Rotate button."""
This will take some time since the image is about 10 mega-pixels.
And it is done! The image has rotated.
Let's have a look at the whole picture. Shift + Ctrl + E brings us back to the image.
Next step is Cropping.
I chose the Crop tool by clicking here.
I want to keep the aspect ratio of the image as 3:2.
"""For that, I check Fixed Aspect ratio here and type in 3:2."""
Just clicking to come out of that box.
"""And now, I can start cropping."""
I want to include the feet of this person here but exclude this part of the image.
"""So, I start here at this point and pressing the left mouse button, I drag upward towards the left to select the area."""
Note that the aspect ratio is constant.
And now I have to decide how far to drag.
I think this is quite good.
Let’s check the borders.
We have excluded this part. There is a person sitting here.
I think there is enough room here for the person to be in the picture.
"""So, I will leave it that way since it looks nice."""
"""There are windows here, on the top."""
"""And there are enough of them in the image, to see them as windows."""
"""But I think there is not enough room around here, at the feet."""
"""So, I'll just click on the image, and drag it a bit down."""
I think this is good now.
But now there are not enough windows seen here and the person seated here is very near to the border.
"""So, lets make the image a bit larger."""
We are running into a problem hereC. Perhaps you can see it.
This happened during the rotation.
There is a small part here which is transparent now.
I don’t want to include that.
"""So, lets go back to Crop tool."""
I want a bit more room here; so I am dragging this up.
Not so far.
I think this is quite good.
Now just click on the image and here we have the cropped & rotated image.
Shift + Ctrl + E brings us back to the full view.
Next step is to boost the colors & contrast a bit.
"""There are several ways here. I could use the color levels - here it is, the curves or some sliders."""
But I will try doing this with Layers.
I simply make a copy of this layer here.
And change the Layers mode to Overlay.
"""And you can see, its a very strong effect. I don’t want to have it that much."""
"""So, I slide the Opacity slider down to a value where I think its looking good."""
Little more perhaps.
"""Ok, I think this is good enough."""
I can always change that unless I right-click the mouse here to go to the channel list and say 'Flatten image' or 'Merge visible layers'.
Then all the changes become permanent
except if I go into History here and go back and undo the history.
But we’ll cover that later.
Next step is Resizing.
I will click on the Image menu & select Scale Image option.
"""Here, I will just type in 800 pixels"""
and I get the value for the Height automatically.
"""When I unlock this link here, I could distort the image while re-sizing it."""
Interpolation. I think I will choose Cubic. I found that the highest layer here gives some art effects with brick buildings. Its strange and I will have to check that out.
"""Now, click on Scale."""
And we’ll look at the result.
Shift + Ctrl + E gets us the whole image.
"""And when I press 1, I get 100% zoom."""
Now we can look around in the image to see if we have any really disturbing or distracting stuff. But I personally think it worked out well.
Next step is Sharpening.
My lens is quite good and my camera too. But we have manipulated the image. So it has to be sharpened a bit.
I will select Filters
"""and click on Enhance and here is Sharpening. I could also use the Unsharp mask which is very powerful sharpening tool. But for now, Sharpening is enough."""
This tool has basically only one option which is the sharpness slider. It can be adjusted and its enough for such an image.
"""This is the unsharpened image and when I drag this slider, the image gets sharpened more and more. You get a very funny effect if you slide it too far."""
I think for this image this value is good.
The hair looks clearer now but here you can see some blending or distortion.
"""So, we will slide it down and this is better."""
I would like to go for soft effects rather than have any distortion in the image.
They are the proof that you have manipulated the image.
"""So, let's look at the result."""
It looks quite good.
And now the last step is Saving this image.
I will go to File and click on Save As and just change the original file extension ‘tif’ to ‘jpg’
and click on the Save button.
I get a warning that the JPEG can't handle images with multiple layers. Ok. So we have to export them.
I think 85%is a good standard value for this image.
So I have saved this image as JPEG image here.
You can look at it in full screen.
"""This is it. The first tutorial of Meet the GIMP. In future tutorials, I will cover topics like how to set up GIMP, how to draw, convert, etc. and tools and many more."""
"""If you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org"""

"""I would like to hear from you. Tell me what you liked, what I could have made better, what you want to see in the future."""
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Functions in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial we will learn,"""
What is a function
Syntax of a function
Significance of return statement
We will do this through examples.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using,"""
"""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 .
Let us start with the introduction to functions.
A function is a self-contained program executing a specific task.
Every program consists of one or more functions.
"""Once executed, the control will be returned back from where it was accessed."""
Let us see the syntax for function.
ret-type defines the type of data that the function returns.
fun_name defines the name of the function.
parameters is the list of variable names and their types.
We can specify an empty parameter list.
This is called as functions without arguments.
And this is called as functions with arguments.
Let us see a program using void.
I have already typed the program on the editor.
So I will open it.
Note that our file name is function.
And I have saved the file with the extension .c (dot c).
Let me explain the code.
This is our header file.
"""Before using any function, it must be defined."""
Here we have defined a function called add.
Note that add function is without any arguments.
And the return type is void.
There are two types of functions-
User-defined that is our add function and
Pre-defined that is printf and main function .
Here we have initialized a and b by assigning them values as 2 and 3.
Here we have declared a variable c.
Then we add the values of a and b.
The result is stored in c.
Then we print the result.
This is our main function.
Here we call the add function.
The addition operation will be performed and the result will be printed.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute the program.
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl,  Alt and T  keys simultaneously."""
"""To compile, type gcc  function dot c  hyphen o  fun."""
"""To execute, type ./fun (dot slash fun)."""
We see the output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 5 .
Now come back to our program.
Functions contain special identifiers called as parameters or arguments.
Let us see the same example with arguments.
I will change a few things here.
"""Type int add(int a, int b)"""
Here we have declared a function add.
int a and int b are the arguments of the function  add.
Let us delete this.No need to initialize a and b here.
Delete the printf statement.
Type int main()
Let us declare a variable sum here.
Type int sum;
"""Then type sum = add(5,4);"""
Here we call the add function.
Then we pass the parameters as 5 and 4.
5 will be stored in a and 4 will be stored in  b.
The addition operation will be performed.
Let us now print the result.
"""Hence type here printf(“Sum is %d”, sum);"""
"""Delete this, as we have already called the function above."""
Type return 0;
A non-void function must use a return statement that returns a value.
Click on Save.
Come back to our terminal.
Now compile the program as before.
Let us execute.
The output is displayed as Sum is 9 .
Now let us see how to execute the same program in C++.
Let me change a few things here.
"""First press Shift, Ctrl and S keys simultaneously."""
Now save the file with .cpp extension.
Click on Save. First we will change the header file as <iostream>
We will include the using statement here.
The function declaration is same in C++.
So there is no need to change anything here.
"""Now replace the printf statement with the  cout statement, as we use cout<< function to print a line in C++."""
We don't need the format specifier and  here.
Delete the comma.
"""Now, type two opening angle brackets."""
"""After sum , again type two opening angle brackets."""
"""Within double quotes, type backslash n."""
Delete this closing bracket.
Now Click on Save.
Let us compile the program.
Type g++ function dot cpp hyphen o fun1
"""Here we have fun1, this is because we don't want to overwrite the output file fun."""
Press Enter.
Type ./fun1
The output is displayed as: Sum is 9
Now we will see the common errors which we can come across.
"""Suppose here, we type x in  place of 4."""
I will retain the rest of the code as it is.
Let us compile the program.
We see an error at line no. 10.
'x' was not declared in this scope.
This is because 'x' is a character variable.
It was not declared anywhere.
And our add function has integer variable as an argument.
"""So, there is a mismatch in return type and return value."""
Let us fix the error.
Type 4 at line no. 10.
Let us execute again.
Compile the program as before.
Yes! It is working.
Now we will see another common error which we can come across.
Suppose here we pass only one parameter.
Delete 4. Click on Save.
Switch to the terminal.
Let us compile.We see an error at line no 10.
"""too few arguments to function 'int add (int, int)'"""
Switch back to our program.
You can see here we have two parameters
int a and int b.
And here we are passing only one parameter.
Hence it is giving an error.
Let us fix the error.
Type 4.
Click on Save .
Let us execute again.
Come back to our slides.
"""To summarize, in this tutorial we have learnt -"""
function Syntax of function
function without arguments
Eg- void add()
Function with arguments
"""Eg- int add(int a, int b)"""
As an assignment- Write a program to calculate the square of a number.

Thank You for joining.
Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Database and validation.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:"""
Interact with database and
Validate the fields.
Here we are using:Ubuntu Version 12.04
Netbeans IDE 7.3
JDK 1.7
Firefox web-browser 21.0
You can use any web-browser of your choice.
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of-"""
Basics of Java Servlets and JSPs
Connecting to MySQL Database   from Netbeans IDE
Creating database and tables
"""If not, for relevant tutorials please visit our website."""
"""Now, let us go to Netbeans IDE."""
I have started the MySQL server.
I have created a database in it named  library.
I have created a table in it named Users.
I have already inserted some values into this table.
I will show them now.
"""For that, right click on Users and click on View Data."""
Click on the Output button at the bottom.
We can see that there are 15 users here.
"""We can see the FirstName, Surname, Age, Gender, email, Username and Password."""
"""Now, let us load the JDBC driver that is Java Database Connectivity Driver."""
"""For that, click on the Projects tab."""
Right-click on Libraries and  click on Add Library.
Then click on MySQL JDBC Driver.
And click on Add Library.
This will load the JDBC Driver.
Let us run the Projectas we had done earlier.
"""Now,  type the User Name as """"arya"""" and Password as """"arya123*""""."""
Then click on Sign In.
We can see the Success Greeting Page.
Click on here to logout.
"""Now, let us switch back to the IDE."""
We will go to GreetingServlet dot java.
Come to the doPost method.
"""First, we get the username and password from the request using getParameter() method."""
"""Next, we will see the code for JDBC connection."""
"""First, we have initialized the Connection object, PreparedStatement object and ResultSet object to null."""
Then we register the driver in our program.
Then we create a connection to the database.
"""Then, we execute the prepareStatement method on the Connection object."""
We give the query to get the user details from Users table.
We check if username and password are same as that which are entered in the form.
"""Here, the question mark denotes each field in the database."""
"""To supply values in place of question mark, we execute the setString() method."""
We do this using the PreparedStatement object.
Then we execute the executeQuery method on the Prepared statement object.
We store  the result in ResultSet object.
"""For successful login, we display the successGreeting page."""
"""For this, we use the RequestDispatcher interface."""
We use the getRequestDispatcher() method on the request to obtain the RequestDispatcher object.
We then invoke the forward() method on RequestDispatcher. object.
"""In this way, we forward to successGreeting dot jsp."""
Now switch back to the slides.
Let us learn something about RequestDispatcher interface.
This  interface provides the facility of dispatching  the request to another resource.
"""The resource can be html, servlet or jsp."""
"""Now, let us come back to the IDE."""
Let us come to successGreeting  dot'jsp.'
"""Here, we are displaying the success message You have successfully logged in."""
"""Now, come back to the browser."""
Type a username and password that we have not included in the database.
"""So, let me type abc as the username and abc123* as the password."""
Then click on Sign In.
We can see that we get the error message on the same page itself.
"""""""Please correct the following errors!!! Invalid username or password"""" ."""
"""Now, let us see the code for this."""
"""So, switch back to the IDE."""
Go to GreetingServlet dot java.
If the validation fails then we should display the error message.
"""First, we have  initialized a List of errorMsgs."""
We set the variable errorMsgs into the request scope using setAttribute method.
"""Here, errorMsgs is the attribute name."""
We have initialized a String variable id to null.
"""Then, we check if the user exists in the database."""
"""If yes, we store the value in the variable id."""
"""Else, we add the error """"Invalid username or password""""  to errorMsgs list."""
If the errorMsgs list is not empty then we display the error messages on index dot jsp.
"""So, we have to redirect to index  dot  jsp."""
We have already seen how to redirect to another page using RequestDispatcher.
Note that we have included this code inside the try catch block to handle exception scenarios.
"""Now, we will see how to fetch errorMsgs variable in index dot jsp."""
"""First, we obtain the value of the attribute """"errorMsgs""""."""
This is done using  getAttribute method on the request.
Note that we have included the Java code within the opening tag  which is less than sign percentage sign and the closing tag percentage sign and greater than sign.
This block of code is known as scriptlet.
It contains Java code which is executed every time JSP is invoked.
If the value of errorMsgs is not null then we  display this message.
"""""""Please correct the following errors""""."""
Then we iterate through the list of  errorMsgs.
We then display the error messages as a list.
This is how we display the error messages on  index dot jsp.
"""Now, let us see how to add a user into the database."""
"""Before adding a user into the database, we have to create a model for the User table."""
"""Now, let us see what a model is."""
A model :Represents the underlying logical structure of data in a software application.
A Java class with attributes and setters and getters for them.
"""In this way, we can consider model as a whole instead of the individual attributes."""
"""Now, switch back to Netbeans IDE."""
I have already created the model User dot java.
Note that we have created this Java class inside the package org dot spokentutorial dot model.
"""We have the following attributes- firstName, surname, age, gender, email, username and password."""
We have initialized them to empty values.
Then we have a parameterized constructor.
We also have the default constructor.
We define the getFirstName method.
We also define the setFirstName method.
"""Similarly, we define the set and get methods on each of the attributes."""
Come back to the browser.
"""Now, let us click on here link to register."""
Type all the fields in the Registration page.
Then click on Add User.
We get  Add User Success page.
"""We get  the message:  """"Your request to add harshita was successful""""."""
Here harshita was the username that we have given.
"""Now, let us see how this is done."""
"""So, switch back to the IDE."""
Go to  AddUserServlet dot  java.
The steps are similar to that we had followed in GreetingServlet dot java.
"""First, we get the form parameters using the getParameter method."""
We initialize variable user as instance of User model with individual attributes.
We set the variable user into the request scope using setAttribute method.
"""If there are no errors while filling  the form, we execute the query to  insert the values into the Users table."""
Then we forward to successUser page.
"""Now, let us come to successUser  dot  jsp."""
"""First, we have imported User dot java."""
This line of code is called directive in JSP.
A JSP directive starts with opening tag- 'less than sign percentage sign and at the rate sign' and ends with closing tag- 'percentage sign and greater than sign'.
This one is a page directive.
The page directive contains a list of all imported packages.
We get the value of the attribute user and store it as the User object.
"""Then, we have the success message here."""
"""Here, we have retrieved the Username."""
We have used the getUsername() method on the request object.
We have done this using scriptlet tags.
"""Now, let us come back to the browser."""
We will try to add a user already present in the database.
"""So, I will try to add harshita again."""
"""We can see that we get the error message  """"Please correct the following errors!!!!  Duplicate entry 'harshita' for key 'UserName'."""
"""Now, let us register for a user once again."""
"""Here, I have filled up the form now."""
I have created a mistake in the Age field.
I have typed ab instead of a valid number.
"""Now, click on Add User."""
"""We see, we get the error message- """"The age must be a positive integer""""."""
"""Now, let us see how this is done."""
Switch back to the IDE.
Open AddUserServlet dot java.
"""Here also, we have created a list for errorMsgs."""
Then we set the variable errorMsgs into the request scope using setAttribute method.
"""Then, we have declared ageUser of type integer and we have initialized it to -1 (minus one)."""
"""Inside the try catch block, we have used parseInt method."""
"""This will return an integer, given a string representation of number as input."""
"""So, here we validate that the age field contains a valid positive integer."""
If the validation fails then we add error message to errorMsgs list.
The age must be a positive integer.
"""Similarly, we have to validate all the other fields to have valid data."""
If the errorMsgs list is not empty then we will display the errorMsgs on addUser dot jsp itself.
We have already seen how to do this using the RequestDispatcher.
"""Now, let us come to addUser dot jsp."""
"""Here also, first we have imported User dot java."""
"""Inside the scriptlet tags, we have created an object of type User."""
Then we get the value of the attribute errorMsgs using getAttribute method.
We check if this value is equal to null.
If it is not equal to null then  we display the error message just as we had done for index  dot jsp.
"""If not, we will get the value of the attribute user from request using  'User' model."""
Then we have the form.
The form tag has action as AddUserServlet and method as POST.
"""The first field is First Name of input type as text , name as firstName  and value as user dot getFirstName."""
"""Here, we are initializing the value of firstName to empty string."""
"""Similarly, you have to do for other fields."""
We also have a  submit  button and value as   Add User.
This is how we validate the fields in addUser.jsp.
"""You can try out different errors on """"addUser"""" page."""
"""Now, let us see if the user harshita has been added to the database."""
"""So, come back to the Users table. We can see that harshita is added to the database."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
Database connectivity and
Field validation.

and create a simple Jframe with one Jlabel displaying an image.
"""In this tutorial, we will -"""
* Create the application form
* Add a package for the image
* Display the image on the Label
* Create mouse-events and pop-ups
* Build and run the application.
"""Now, let us switch to the IDE to create our sample application."""
"""From the File menu, choose New Project."""
"""Under Categories , select  Java; under Projects select Java Application and click Next."""
"""In the Project Name field, type: ImageDisplayApp."""
Clear the  Create Main Class check-box.
Make sure that the Set as Main Project check-box is selected.
Click Finish. The project is created in your IDE.
"""In this section, we will create the Jframe form and add a Jlabel to the form."""
Let us first create the Jframe form.
"""In the Projects window, expand the ImageDisplayApp node."""
Right-click on the Source Packages node and choose  New >> Jframe Form.
"""In the Class Name field, type: ImageDisplay."""
"""In the Package field, type: org.me.myimageapp"""
and click Finish.
"""Now, let us add the Jlabel."""
"""In the Palette, on the right hand side of the IDE, select the Label component and drag it to the Jframe."""
"""For now, your form should look something like this."""
"""When you use images or other resources in an application, typically you create a separate Java package for the resource."""
"""On your local file system, a package corresponds with a folder."""
"""In the Projects window, right-click the org.me.myimageapp node and choose New > Java Package."""
"""In the New Package Wizard, add '.resources' to 'org.me.myimageapp'."""
"""So, the new package is now called org.me.myimageapp.resources."""
Click Finish.
"""In the Projects window, you should see the image appear within the org.me.myimageapp.resources package, when you add the image."""
"""In this application, the image will be embedded within a Jlabel component."""
Let us now add the image to the label.
"""In the GUI designer, select the label that you have added to your form."""
"""In the Properties window, below the Palette, on the right hand side of the window, scroll down to the icon property."""
Click the ellipsis (...) or the three dots on the right side.
"""In the icon Property dialog-box, click Import to Project."""
"""In the file chooser, navigate to the folder that contains your image that you want to use."""
Click Next.
"""In the Select target folder page of the wizard, select the resources folder"""
and click Finish.
"""After you click Finish, the IDE copies the image to your project."""
"""Therefore, when you build and run the application, the image is included in the distributable JAR file."""
Click OK here.
And right-click on your project node and select  Clean and Build option.
"""You can now go to the Files menu and under the build folder,"""
"""under dist folder, you can see the jar file."""
It generates the code in the 'imagedisplay' class to access the image.
It also displays your image on the label in the Design view of your form.
"""At this point, you can do some simple things to improve the appearance of the form."""
"""In the Properties window, select the Text property"""
and delete jLabel1.
That value was generated by the GUI Builder as display text for the label.
"""However, you are using the label to display an image rather than text."""
"""So, this text is not needed."""
"""Now, let us drag the label to center it on the form."""
"""In the GUI Designer, click the  Source tab."""
Scroll down to the line that says  Generated Code.
"""And click the plus sign (+) to the left of the  Generated Code line, to display the code that the  GUI Designer has generated."""
"""Here, the keyline is this."""
"""Since you have used the  Property editor for  jLabel1s icon property, the IDE has generated the setIcon method."""
The parameter of that method contains a call to the  getResource() method on an anonymous inner class of ImageIcon.
"""Once your image has been added, in the  Design view  right-click on the image."""
Click on Events > Mouse > mouseClicked.
The view is switched to the Source mode.
Here you can add the code to customize your action on a mouse-click.
Let me add a few lines of code to generate a pop-up when the image is clicked in the GUI.
I have now entered a few lines of code to generate the pop-up.
"""First, I have created a new  Jframe for the pop-up"""
and I have set the defaultCloseOperation.
"""And finally, provided the text for the pop-up."""
"""After adding these lines of code, let us import the necessary packages by adding two statements at the beginning of the file."""
Include:  import javax.swing.*;
and  import java.awt.*;
This will import the necessary packages required for this program.
Let us now build and run the application.
We have generated the code for accessing and displaying the image.
Let us build and run the application to ensure that the image is accessed.
"""First, we need to set the project's  Main class."""
"""When you set the  Main class, the  IDE knows which class to run when you run the project."""
"""In addition, this ensures that the Main class element in the application's JAR file is generated when you build the application."""
"""Here, right-click on the ImageDisplayApp project's Node in the Projects window and choose Properties."""
"""In the Project Properties dialog-box, select the Run category on the left side."""
"""Click the Browse button, that is next to the Main Class field."""
Select  org.me.myimageapp.ImageDisplay  and click on  Select Main Class
Say OK here.
"""Now, right-click  on the  Project node  and select Clean & Build."""
You can view the Build  properties of the application in the  Files window.
The Build folder contains the compiled class.
The dist folder contains an executable JAR file that contains the compiled class and the image.
Now choose Run from the tool bar.
Our output window opens with the image.
I will click on this image now.
And you can see the pop-up at the top which shows the description of the image.
"""Now, time for the assignment!"""
"""Create another GUI with four images, similar to the demonstration shown in this tutorial."""
"""For each of the images, specify different events such as keyboard event, mouse-motion event, mouse-click event, mouse-wheel event."""
I have already created the assignment.
Let us run the assignment project.
Your assignment should look similar to this.
I have created keyboard-events and mouse-events for my assignment here.
"""So, to summarize-"""
"""we have created a Jframe form,"""
"""added a package for the image,"""
"""displayed the image on the label,"""
and also created mouse-events and pop-ups.
"""If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch it."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Blocks in Admin's Dashboard.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to add and delete blocks and set the Front page."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04,"""
"""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30,"""
Moodle 3.3 and  Firefox web browser.
"""You may use any web browser of your choice. However, Internet Explorer should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
"""Learners of this tutorial should have basic knowledge of the Admin’s dashboard. If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and open your Moodle site. Make sure that the XAMPP service is running.
Login with your admin username and password details.
We are now in the Admin’s dashboard.
Recall that Blocks serve a specific purpose or information and are found on all pages of Moodle.
Let us understand how we can work with Moodle Blocks now.
"""Depending on the theme used, blocks can be on the right side or on both sides."""
Blocks contain information we want people to see whenever they log in.
"""There are many types of blocks available in Moodle. And, they can be moved or arranged easily as per our preferences."""
We will now add a few blocks to our dashboard.
Click on the navigation menu on the left of the page.
Click on Customise this page button on the right hand side of the dashboard.
Notice that a new menu item Add a block is visible now. Click on Add a block.
A new pop-up window opens. We need to select the type of block that we want to add.
"""For example, click on Messages. You can see that the Messages block now appears in the dashboard."""
Currently there are no messages.
"""By default, all new blocks get added to the right-most column."""
Let us add one more block. Click on Add a block menu on the left.
Select HTML from the list of menu types. HTML block is a block where one can write custom HTML.
"""Using this, we can embed widgets such as Library widgets, News feeds, Twitter, Facebook etc."""
Notice now that a NEW HTML BLOCK has been added below the Messages block.
Click on the gear icon in the HTML block. Then click on Configure (NEW HTML BLOCK) block.
"""Configure HTML block has 3 sections: Block settings ,  Where this block appears and On this page."""
"""By default, the first section is expanded."""
Click on Expand all to expand all the sections.
"""In the Block title, let’s type: “Things to do”."""
Let us add some tasks for this admin user in the Content area.
"""Type the following: Create a new course,  Create new users,  Add users to the course."""
The editor is an HTML editor and can be used like any other word processor or editor.
Scroll down to see the options under Where this block appears.
"""Under Default region, select Content. In Default weight, select -10 (minus ten)."""
"""The lower the weight of a block, the higher it will appear in that region. -10 (minus ten) is the lowest."""
"""By selecting -10, I am ensuring that it is at the top of the content region."""
This block  will appear on the Admin’s dashboard.
Now comes the “On this page” section. This is where you can define the configuration for the page where this block was added.
"""In our case, this is the dashboard. This configuration will override the default configuration defined in the above section"""
"""that is, the Where this block appears section. Let us select Content in Region and -10 (minus ten) in Weight in this section."""
"""Please note that depending on the type of the block, configuration settings will vary."""
Click Save Changes to save the changes and go back to the dashboard.
"""See that the new HTML block with the title Things to do is now visible. And, it is the topmost block in the content region."""
We can also change the position of a block by dragging it using the Move icon.
Let us move Things to do block below the Course Overview block by dragging and dropping it.
Let us see how this changes the configuration we set a few minutes back.
Click on the gear icon and then on Configure Things to do block. Then click on Expand All.
"""Scroll down to see “On this page” section. The weight has changed to -2 (minus two). The default weight, however, remains the same."""
Click Cancel to go back to the dashboard.
We do not need this Learning Plans block. So let us delete it. Click on the gear icon and then on Delete Learning plans block.
Confirm pop-up window appears and prompts us to make sure about this deletion. Click on Yes button here.
Notice that the Learning Plans block is no longer available. We can always add this block later if required.
Let us now customize the front page of our Moodle installation.
Click on Site Administration link on the left menu.
Scroll down to locate Front Page settings in the Front page section. Click on it.
Let us change the Full Site Name to Digital India Learning Management System.
This is the text that appears at the top of every page above the breadcrumbs.
Short name is the text that appears in the title of the page.
Notice that the title of this page is Digital India LMS followed by the name of the page we are in.
Short name is also used as a logo text if we do not provide any logo image. We will leave it as it is.
Scroll down to see drop-downs for Front page items. These are the list of items that can be shown on the front page.
"""All visitors, whether they are logged in or not, can see these items."""
The order is determined by a combination box. We will leave this as it is.
"""So, all users will be able to see the list of courses (if available) and nothing else."""
Next is the Front page items when logged in. This is the list of items that can be shown to the users who are logged in.
Let us select Enrolled courses in the first drop-down.
We will leave the rest of the options with their default values.
Scroll down and click on Save Changes.
Let us now summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to add an HTML block called “Things to do” and specified where it should appear on the page."""
We also set up the frontpage for guests and logged-in users.

Warm greetings everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Create surfaces.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:  view properties of the molecule,"""
"""label the atoms with partial charge,"""
"""create Van der waals surface,"""
color the surface according to the electrostatic potential energies.
"""Here, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version. 14.04, Avogadro version 1.1.1."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with 'Avogadro' interface."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website."""
Here I have opened the Avogadro window.
Insert a molecule of butane from Insert Fragment Library.
"""Click on Build menu, then click on Insert ->fragment."""
Double-click on alkanes folder to open. Select butane.cml.
Click on Insert button.
Close the dialog box.
A model of n-butane is displayed on the panel.
Clear the selection using Select none option from the Select menu.
Let us display molecular properties of the molecule.
"""Click on View menu, select Properties option."""
"""From the sub-menu, click on Molecule Properties."""
"""Molecule Properties window opens with information such as: IUPAC Molecule Name, Molecular weight, Chemical Formula, Dipole moment etc."""
Click on OK to close the window.
"""Similarly to view the Atom Properties, click on Atom properties option from the properties menu."""
"""A table opens with values of properties such as: Element, Type, Valence, Formal charge etc for each atom in the molecule."""
"""Explore other properties like Angle, Torsion and Conformer from the list."""
Let us now learn to label the atoms in the molecule with partial charge.
"""Click on Display settings from the Display Types list, check the box against Label."""
Click on the Spanner symbol on the right side of Label check box.
Label Settings window opens.
Click on Partial charge option from atom labels text drop down. Now all the atoms in the molecule are labeled with partial charge.
The partial charge distribution helps to predict the reactivity of the carbon atoms.
Inductive effect can be explained by labeling the atoms with partial charge.
Replace a hydrogen with chlorine. Notice the change in the value of partial charge along the carbon chain.
"""Because of the inductive effect, carbons close to chlorine become more positive."""
We have also an option to label the bonds. Click on the bond labels text box.
The drop-down menu has options to label the bonds.
Click on bond length. The bond lengths for all the bonds are displayed on the panel.
"""To change the color of the labels, click on the box filled with color."""
Select the color from the Select atoms label color window. Click on OK button.
"""We can shift the labels in X, Y and Z direction."""
Click on the increment or decrement buttons in the label shift menu. Close the dialog box.
"""Another very useful feature of Avogadro is, the ability to create surfaces."""
The option for creating surfaces is available in the Extensions menu.
"""Click on Extensions menu, then click on Create Surfaces option."""
A Create Surface dialog box opens on the screen.
Surface Type drop-down has two options: Van der waals and electro-static potential.
Electrostatic potential surfaces  are not yet supported in Avogadro.
"""Choose Van der waals option. In the Color By drop down, select Nothing."""
Set Resolution to Medium.
Iso value to zero. Click on Calculate button.
The Van der waals surface is displayed on the panel.
Van der waals surface is a representation of surface through which a molecule interacts with other molecules.
"""To change the surface settings, click on the spanner symbol corresponding to Surfaces."""
A Surface Settings dialog box opens. Drag the slider to adjust the opacity.
"""In the Render drop-down, there are different display options to choose such as: Fill, lines and points."""
The default option is fill.
"""To change the color of the surface, click on the box filled with color next to Positive option."""
Select the color from the basic color chart by clicking on the color. Click on OK button.
"""Next, from the Create surface window, choose Electrostatic potential from the Color by drop-down."""
Set the resolution to medium.  Set the Iso value to 0.02.
Setting low Iso value gives a finer surface.
Click on Calculate button.
"""On the panel, we see the surface of 1-chloro butane,  colored according to the electro-static potential values of atoms."""
Electrostatic potential surface illustrates charge distributions of the molecule.
They are also used in predicting the behavior of molecules.
"""By default, areas of high electronegativity are colored in red and least in blue."""
Here are a few more examples of molecules with electro-static potential surfaces.
Aniline and cyclohexylamine.
The electron density on the Nitrogen of cyclohexylamine is more localized than it is in aniline.
Hence cyclohexylamine is a stronger base.
"""Let's summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to: view properties of the molecule,"""
"""label the atoms with partial charge,"""
"""create Van der waals surface,"""
color the surface according to the electrostatic potential energies.
As an assignment: compare the reactivity of acetaldehyde and formamide using electro-static potential surface.
Label the atoms with partial charge.
Your completed assignment should look as follows.
Negative charge indicated in red is more localized on the oxygen atom of acetaldehyde.
The Negative charge is more delocalized in formamide.
"""Hence, Acetaldehyde is more reactive than Formamide."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Nested-If and Ternary Operator in java.
By the end of this tutorial you should be able to: Explain Nested-If Statements and Ternary operators and  Use them in a Java program.
"""For this tutorial we are using: Ubuntu v 11.10, JDK 1.6, and EclipseIDE 3.7.0"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should know"""
about the usage of relational and logical operators
and if...else control flow statements.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown."""
Nested if statements: An If statement within another if statement  is called a nested-if statement.
Now let us look at the syntax for writing the Nested-If statement.
"""In this case, if condition1 is true, then the program checks for condition2."""
Condition 2 is given using another if statement.
If condition2 is true then the program executes Statement or block 1.
"""Else, it executes Statement or block 2."""
If condition1 is false then the program will not check condition2.
"""Now, let us try an example to understand that better."""
We have the eclipse IDE and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
We have created a class NesedIfDemo and added the main method to it.
We shall check if the given number is an even number or an odd number.
we will also handle negative numbers using a nested-if.
"""So, inside the main method type:"""
int n = minus 5;
We have created a variable 'n'  to store the negative number.
"""Now, we shall write the if conditions."""
"""Next line, type: if (n  < 0)"""
open curly bracket. Press Enter.
System.out.println within brackets and double quotes Negative number;
We first see if the number is a negative number.
"""If yes, then we will not check for even and odd."""
"""If the number is not a negative, we check for 'even' and 'odd'."""
"""Next line, type:else open curly bracket. Press Enter."""
"""Now, if the execution has come to the else part,"""
it means that the number is non-negative.
"""So, we check for odd or even inside this else part."""
Type:if within brackets n modulus 2  double equal to 0 open curly bracket press Enter.
System.out.println  within brackets and double quotes Even number;
"""Then type the else part. else open curly braket, press Enter."""
Type: System.out.println within brackets and double quotes Odd number semicolon.
"""So, we make sure that negative numbers are not considered for 'odd' or 'even' check."""
"""Now, let us see the code in action."""
"""Save and run the file. As we can see, we get the output  as negative number."""
Now let us try a positive number.
Change n = -5 to n = 5.
Now Save and Run the file.
"""As we can see, the output is Odd number as expected. Let us try an even number."""
Change n = 5 to n = 10.
Now Save and run the file.
"""As we can see, the output is Even number as expected."""
"""This process of including an if statement inside another, is called nested-if."""
There is no limit to the amount of nesting.
But it is a good practice to not go beyond 3 levels of nesting.
Now we shall look at the ternary operator.
"""First, let me clean up the main method."""
We shall write a program that divides a number by 2.
It is a very trivial program but the issue comes in dividing odd numbers.
"""When 7 is divided by 2, we get 3."""
But what if we want the result to be rounded off.
"""Which means, when 7 is divided by 2, we get  4 and not 3."""
"""In simple terms, we need the next number."""
"""Let us see how to write such a program."
"See, inside the main method type:  int n, nHalf semicolon."""
We will store the number in n and the half number in nHalf
"""Next line, type: n = 5 semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: if within bracket n modulus 2 == 0 open curly brackets. Press Enter."""
Type: nHalf = n / 2 semicolon.
"""In the else part, type: within curly brackets nHalf equal to within brackets n+1 the whole divided by 2 semicolon."""
We check if the number is even or odd and do the division accordingly.
Now  Let us add a print statement to see the program in action.
"""So, type System.out.println within brackets nHalf semicolon."""
Now  Save and Run the file.
"""As we can see, our objective is met. We get the output as 3 and not 2."""
"""But if we notice, all we are doing is setting the value of a variable depending on a condition."""
There is more syntax than logic in our program.
This is when ternary operator makes code simpler.
Ternary Operator is a conditional operator providing results similar to nested-if.
It Provides a short syntax and is denoted by a question mark.
It takes three operands at a time.
Let us learn about the syntax of Ternary Operator.
The Expression is the condition that has to be checked.
Operand 1 is the value of the variable. Result if the condition is true.
Operand 2 is the value if the condition is false.
Now Let us use it in our program.
"""First, let us remove the if-else statement."""
Type: nHalf equal to  n modulus 2 double equal to 0 question mark n / 2 colon within brackets n + 1 the whole divided by 2 semicolon.
This statement reads:
"""If 'n' is even, 'nHalf' is 'n by 2'. Otherwise it is 'n plus 1 by 2'."""
Let us now see it in action.
Save and Run the file. Press Ctrl S and Ctrl F11 keys.
"""As we can see, the output is as expected."""
"""This way, ternary operator reduces clutter in the code and improves readability."""
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
About Nested-If Statements and Ternary Operator and
Usage of Nested-If Statements and Ternary Operator in a Java program.
Write java program for the following.
Check whether a number is even and also a multiple of 11 using nested-if.
Identify the largest number among the two given numbers using Ternary operator.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Arithmetic Operators in C And C++.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
Arithmetic operators like '+' Addition: e.g. a+b.
'-' Subtraction: e.g. a-b.
'/' Division: e.g. a/b.
'*'  Multiplication: e.g. a*b.
'%' Modulus: e.g. a%b.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 11.10 as the operating system gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 in Ubuntu."
I will now demonstrate the use of these arithmetic operations with the help of a C program.
I have already written the program.
"""So, I will open the editor and explain the code."""
Here is the C program for arithmetic operators.
"""In the first two statements, the variables are declared and defined."""
"""In the next two statements, a is assigned the value of 5. b is assigned the value of 2."
Now let's see how the addition operator works.
c holds the sum of a and b.
This printf statement displays the sum of a and b on the screen.
Here % dot 2f provides the precision of two digits after the decimal point.
"""In the next statement, c holds the product of a and b."""
This printf statement displays the product of a and b on the screen.
Let's see how these two operators work.
We will comment out the following lines.
Type  /* (slash asterisk) */
Click on Save.
Save the file with extension .c (dot c).
I have saved my file as arithmetic.c.
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""To compile the code, type the following on the terminal."""
gcc space arithmetic dot c space minus o space arith
"""To execute the code, type ./arith (dot slash arith)."""
press Enter.
The output is displayed on the screen.
"""It shows,Sum of 5 and 2 is 7.00 and"""
Product of 5 and 2 is 10.00.
Now you should try the subtraction operator on your own.
Try replacing the addition operator with subtraction operator.
You should get the result as 3.
Coming back to the program and the last set of statements.
"""Now, I will explain the code for division."""
Remove the multiline comments  here and here.
"""In these statements, c holds the value of integer division of a by b."""
Please note that in integer division the fractional part is truncated.
The printf statement displays the division output on the screen.
In this statement we are performing real division.
Here one of the operands has to be cast as float.
We have type-cast variable a.
Now a will behave as a float variable for a single operation.
The printf statement displays the output of real division on the screen.
Type return 0; and close the ending curly bracket.
Click on Save.
Coming back to the terminal to compile and execute the code.
"""To compile, typegcc space arithmetic dot c minus o space arith. Press Enter."""
"""To execute the code, type ./arith. Press Enter."""
The output is displayed on the screen.
We have the previous outputs of addition and multiplication operators.
We have the integer Division of 5 by 2 is 2.
We can see  that  in integer division the fractional part is truncated.
Then we have  the real division of 5 by 2 is 2.5.
"""In real division, the result is as expected."""
We  used type-casting to obtain these results.
"""Now suppose, I want to write the same program in C++."""
Let's see  if I can use the same code in C++ too? Let's find out.
Let me go back to the editor.
Here is a C++ code.
Notice that the header is different from the C file header.
namespace is also used here.
"""Also, notice that the output statement in C++ is cout."""
"""So, apart from these differences, the two codes are very similar."""
Click on Save.Make sure the file is saved with the extension .cpp.
I have saved my file as arithmetic.cpp.
Let's execute the code and see what results we get.
Open the terminal and type  g++ space arithmetic dot cpp space  minus o arith . Press Enter.
"""To  execute the  code, type  ./ arith. Press Enter."""
Here the output is displayed.
"""So, we see that  the results are similar to the C program."""
The only difference is in the precisions of outputs.
Let us now summarize the tutorial.
In this tutorial we learnt how to use the arithmetic operators.
As an assignment: Write a program to demonstrate the use of modulus operator.
Please note that Modulus operator finds the remainder of division.  e.g. c = a % b;
You should obtain the result as 1.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Numerical Data types in Java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
The various Numerical Data types  available in Java and
How to use them to store numerical data.
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse 3.7."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know how to write and run a simple java program in Eclipse."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown."""
The data type used to store integers is called int.
The data type used to store decimal numbers is called float.
Let us define and use integers first.
"""Here, we have the 'Eclipse IDE' and the skeleton required for the rest of the code."""
We have created a class NumericalData  and  added the main method to it.
"""Now, let us see how to store a number."""
int distance equal to 28;
This statement stores the integer value in the name distance.
The name distance is called  an integer variable.
Now we shall use the variable distance to print the value stored in it.
System dot out dot println in parentheses distance;
This statement prints the value of the variable distance.
Save the file and Run it.
We can see that the value 28 has been stored in distance and it has been printed.
Now let us change the value stored in the variable.
change 28 to 24.
Save and Run.
We  see that the output  has changed accordingly.
int can also store negative values.
Change 24 to minus 25 (-25).
"""As we can see, even negative values can be stored in variables of the type int."""
The data type int is enough for most of our programming needs.
But it can only store values up to a limit.
Let us try to store a large value and see what happens.
"""As we can see, there is a red line below the number which indicates an error."""
The error message says: the number is out of range for a variable of the type int.
int takes 32 bits of memory and can store values only from -2 power 31 to 2 power 31.
"""To store large numbers, Java provides the long data type."""
Let us use it to store a large value.
Change int to long and
add a capital L at the end of the number.
"""Save it with Ctrl, S."""
We see that now there is no error.
"""Let us run it with Ctrl, F11. The value has been printed."""
We can see that large numbers can be stored in a long variable.
"""Now, let us store a decimal number in a int variable."""
Change long to int and change the number to 23.5;
"""As we can see, there is an error. That is because int can only store integers."""
"""To store decimal numbers, we have to use float."""
change the data type to float.
And add an f at the end of the value;
Save it.
We see that now their is no error.
Run it with Control F11.
"""As we can see, the decimal value has been stored and the value has been printed."""
"""Now, let us change the value of  the variable distance."""
Add a  lot of numbers after the decimal point as shown.
Save it  and Run it.
we  see that  the  output is little different from what has been stored.
This happens because there is a limit to the precision of a floating point number.
It is rounded off to the closest possible number if it cannot be stored accurately.
Now let us see the naming rules for variables.
Add a number 2 before the name.
we see that there is a syntax error.
This is because a variable name must only start with an alphabet or an underscore.
But generally 'underscore' is not used to start a variable name.
"""Now, let us add the number at the end of the variable name."""
We see that there is no error.
A variable name can have digits but not at the beginning.
"""Now add an  'underscore' in the middle of the name,"""
we see that there is no error
which means an 'underscore' is permitted  in a variable name.
But any other punctuation in a variable name might give a syntax error or other errors.
This is how you store numerical data in Java.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about the various numerical data types"""
and how to store numerical data.
And we have also learnt the rules for naming a variable.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial,"""
read about other numerical data types and
see how they are different from int and float.

Welcome to Meet The GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""Today, we will talk about the Fuzzy Select Tool."""
It is closely related to the Select by Colour tool.
But the Fuzzy Select Tool selects only one contiguous region and the colour select tool selects all regions with similar colours.
"""There are some similar options like Replace, Add, Subtract and Intersect with the current selection and now I select Replace."""
"""Here you can see the same option, Antialiasing."""
"""If we select Antialiasing, border of the selection is not sharp and you get smooth corners."""
And if it is not selected then you have a really sharp border between selected and unselected.
The further options are Feather edges and Select transparent areas.
Select transparent areas is useful while using mask sensor on perhaps.
Sample merged is the same as with the other and it selects all the visible layers.
If it is not selected then it works on current layer.
If you want to select something from the total output of image then select this option.
Here is Threshold which defines how much difference between the colours is allowed to be in the selection or when something is out of selection.
It helps in selecting the pixels that have one definite colour.
"""The next important selection is, which mode do you want to have in the selection."""
"""The Composite mode is the gray value of added Red, Green and Blue channels."""
"""You can select the Red, the Green, the Blue channel or the Hue, Saturation or the Value channel as the base for your selection."""
Now let's try Fuzzy Select Tool.
"""I just click into the image and the Threshold is zero, so let's see what happens."""
I make a selection which is one pixel in size.
Now I increase the amount of Threshold to say 30 and click into the image and click on Toggle Quick Mask here.
Now you can see the area which is selected.
"""I de-select the Quick Mask toggle, press tab to get the toolbox and press Shift+Ctrl+A to unselect everything."""
"""I can do this in a different way and for that, I decrease the Threshold to zero and click into the image and now, I am drawing the mouse down and right."""
"""When I increase the threshold, you can see that I am going into this blue area but I am still on the wall."""
"""I think, this tool is more useful for graphic designers and not for photographers."""
You can change the Threshold by just pulling the mouse.
This works the same in colour selection tool.
I change Select by from Composite to Hue and click at the same point and draw to the bottom.
"""You can see that I have a way better selection of  blue, green part of the wall, than I had before."""
"""So, choosing the right method of colour definition gives good result with this tool."""
I click into the quick mask and here you see it’s nearly perfect; only some parts to repair and I would do that with painting in the quick mask and not with these selection tools.
If you are confused about selecting the mode then you can see your image in different channels in the Channels mode.
Select the Blue channel and you see that everything has nearly the same blue value.
"""In the Green channel, there are some differences."""
"""In the Red channel, it’s nearly the same here."""
"""So, I would select the Green channel for selecting or in this case Hue channel."""
Selecting colour is the next tool here and it has the same function and same options here.
It has only one difference.
"""If you click here, you will select all fields with this colour and not one contiguous area."""
The colour selection tool selects all the areas with the similar colour.
The name of the next tool is  Intelligent scissors or Scissors selection tool .
This algorithm looks for edges and tries to follow them with the selection.
"""And I want to select here, these letter boxes."""
"""So, I activate the selection tool and I pull a point here and I get a plus sign near the cursor and I simply select the points."""
"""The algorithm is supposed to follow the borders and you can see here, it didn’t take the other way, it took the inside way."""
I zoom into the image and now I can draw this point up to here and there was a mistake with selecting this point.
"""So, I pull these points up and you can see the algorithm follows the border, if you give enough information where to follow."""
It looks pretty good but I usually don’t use this because there are better ways to do this.
"""I think, I would use the colour selection tool because it always takes the wrong way round."""
"""So, I finished with the selection."""
I just click on the first point here and the cursor changes to plus.
"""Now, put the next point and I have these two rings making a loop out of it."""
I can still move the point around here and make the selection better.
"""So, when I now click into the selection second time, the selection is selected."""
"""And, to look at the quality, I activate the Quick Mask and zoom into it."""
"""Now, I look around in the selection."""
"""Here is my fault, I should have clicked here."""
"""So, this is the fairly intelligent scissors."""
The next and the last tool I want to cover today is the Foreground Selection Tool.
It was quite sensation when the algorithm came out sometime ago and it was not so sensational in using in the GIMP.
"""But, let's give it a try."""
Here are the same modes and antialiasing isn’t activatable.
"""And here, I want to select one single area and I want to select the statue."""
"""So, first I zoom into the image to get a  better control."""
"""Now, I select the selection tool and I can select contiguous region or different region but I select the Contiguous region."""
"""First I make a rough selection here, with the automatic laser tool. And now you can see that the area which is not selected, is in blue colour."""
I have selected a brush here and I can control the diameter of the brush with this slider and I paint through this stuff I want to have selected.
I have to see that I don’t select stuff which I don’t want to have in the image.
"""When I release the mouse button, the algorithm starts to work and some areas here have to be selected."""
"""Every time the selection gets updated and area that is similar to the stuff I just painted over, gets selected."""
"""Now, I click on Mark Background and start painting the background that I don’t want to have in the image."""
This tool works better when there is more difference between the selected part and the stuff which is not selected and here the difference is not big enough.
Just press Enter to accept the selection.
"""I think, you have got an idea of how this tool works."""
The Paths tool belongs also to this part but I will cover that sometimes else.
"""In the Select menu, there are some other stuff you can do with selections and I will cover that also sometime else."""
"""So, this was it for this tutorial."""
Let me hear some comments and I promise you for the next show with really new things which are viewer generated content.
You will find a link to this file in the show notes at meetthegimp.org and if you want to leave a comment then please do that.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Warli art for Textile design using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial we will learn to create a Warli pattern design for borders, Repeat patterns using cloning"""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.91"""
Let us open Inkscape. First let us design the warli pattern.
Go to File.  Click on Document Properties.  Change the Orientation to Landscape.  Close the dialog box
Select the Rectangle tool. Draw a rectangle covering the whole canvas and color it blue.
"""Click on the Ellipse tool.  Draw a circle outside the canvas. Then, click on the Selector tool."""
"""On the Tool controls bar, change the width and height to 15."""
Change its color to orange. Move it to the bottom of the canvas as shown.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the circle.
On the Tool controls bar change the width and height to 7.
Move the duplicated circle to the bottom left of the original circle.
This is the head of the warli figure.
"""Next, Go to Object menu.  Click on Symbols options. Click on Symbol set drop-down menu. Select Flow Chart Shapes."""
A list of geometrical shapes appears. Click on the triangle shape and drag it to the canvas. Change the color to orange. And remove the Stroke.
"""On the Tool controls bar, change the width and height to 20."""
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the triangle. Press V to flip it.
"""Arrange the triangles below the head, as shown."""
This is the body of the warli figure.
Select the Rectangle tool.  And draw a line in between the head and the body.
Now the neck of the figure is drawn.
"""Next let us draw the hands and legs.  For this, we will select the Bezier tool."""
Draw hands and legs as demonstrated.
"""Select both the hands and legs. Using the Picker tool on the Fill and Stroke, pick the orange color from the body of the warli art."""
Change the Stroke width to 2.
Now select all the elements and press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
Now the warli figure is ready. Let us now create a round pattern with this warli figure.
"""Let me make a copy of this figure and keep it to one side, before proceeding further."""
"""Now select the original warli art. Now, click once more on the figure, to make the anchor point visible."""
Click on the anchor point and move it down as demonstrated.
Now go to Edit.  Click on Clone and then on Create Tiled Clones.
"""In the dialog box, under Symmetry tab, the option in the drop-down menu should be Simple translation."""
"""Then go to Shift tab.  Under Per column option, change the X value to -100."""
Next go to Rotation tab.  Change the Per row and Per column parameters of the angle to 30.
"""At the bottom, let the number of rows be 1. Change the number of columns to 12."""
Then click on Create button.
Observe the round pattern that is created on the canvas.
Let us now try some other options.
Under Rotation tab Change the Per row and Per column parameters of the angle to 10.Click on Create.
Observe the created pattern on the canvas. To make it a complete round pattern change the number of Rows to 40.
Click on Create. Observe the changes on the canvas.
"""In such a way, you can change the Rotation parameters to get the patterns in different angles."""
Select the round pattern and press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
We now have a lovely warli art on our canvas.
"""Let's move it to one side, like this."""
"""Now, let's try some other options."""
"""Next, using the Create Spirals tool, draw a fairly large spiral on the canvas, as shown."""
"""Click on the Selector tool.  Select the single warli figure and place it at the centre of the spiral, like this."""
Now click on Raise to top option on the Tool Controls bar.
"""Then, select the spiral too."""
Click on Extensions menu and choose Generate from path option.
"""In the sub-menu that appears, select Scatter."""
"""A dialog box opens on the screen. Here, check the Follow path orientation checkbox."""
"""In Space between copies, we will say 5."""
Ensure that - Original pattern will be is set to Moved and Duplicate the pattern before deformation is also checked.
Click on Apply button and close the dialog box.
"""Let's move the spiral warli pattern aside a little to expose the spiral path.  Now, select the spiral path and delete it."""
This is how one can draw a beautiful spiral warli pattern in Inkscape.
"""Likewise, we can create many other lovely warli patterns."""
"""Next, let us learn how to create a border."""
Go to Object menu and click on Symbols.  Click on the triangle shape and drag it to the canvas.
"""On the Tool controls bar, change the width and height to 30."""
Now move the triangle to the top left of the canvas.
I want to create a row pattern using the triangle.
Go to Edit. Click on Clone and then on Create Tiled Clones. All the previous settings are visible here..
"""In the Rotation tab, change the Angle parameter of Per Row and Per Column to 0."""
"""In the Shift tab, under Per column option, change the X value to 0."""
"""Lastly, change the Column to 35, at the bottom, as shown here. Then click on Create button."""
Observe the row pattern that is created on the canvas.
Select all the triangles and press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the triangle pattern. Press V to flip it.
Now move the pattern to the bottom of the canvas.
Our warli pattern is now ready. We can use this pattern as border in various textile design assignments.
This is how it looks on a kurti.
"""We can use this as a pillow cover design, also."""
"""And this warli art looks great on a cloth bag, too."""
"""So, in a similar way, you can create various textile patterns using the warli art form."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we have learnt to create Warli pattern for textiles, patterns using cloning"""
Here is an assignment for you. Create a peacock pattern design

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on  files in C .
In this tutorial we will learn:
How to open a file.
How to read data from a file.
How to write data into a file.
Few examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10,  gcc Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with the introduction to files.
File is a collection of data.
"""It can be a database, a program, a letter or anything."""
We can create a file and access it using C.
Now let us see an example on file handling in C.
I have a written program.
Let's take a look Note that our file name is file.c
In this program we will create a file and write data into it.
Let me explain the code now.
This is our header file.
To define a file variable we use the type FILE.
The FILE variable is defined under the header stdio.h.
*fp is a pointer to the FILE variable.
"""It will store all the information about the file , like its name, status and current information."""
Let us go back to our slides.
Now we will see the syntax to open a file.
"""Here, the fopen() function opens a stream."""
Then it links the file with the stream.
file name is the name of the file that we want to open or create.
We can give the path along with the file name.
And We can also give the extension.
Here we can give the mode of the file.
Let us see the types of modes :
"""""""w"""" - creates file for read and write."""
"""""""r"""" – opens  file for reading."""
"""""""a"""" – writing at the end of the file."""
Now come back to our program.
"""Here, we create a Sample.txt file in write mode."""
We can see that the path is given.
Our file will be created on the desktop.
Then we will write the statements into the file.
"""""""Welcome to the spoken-tutorial""""  and"""
"""""""This is a test example""""."""
fprintf() writes output to the given output stream.
fclose() closes the file associated with the stream.
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space file dot c space hyphen o space file. Press Enter."
"To execute, type dot slash file (./file). Press Enter."
We see the file is executed.
Now we will check it out.
Let us open the Home folder.
Click on the Home folder option.
Now click on the Desktop option.
Here is our sample.txt file.
This shows that our file is successfully created.
Now let us open.
Double click on the file.
We can see the messages here.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial.
This is a test example.
This is how we create a file and write data into it.
Now we will see how to read data from a file.
I have already made the program.
I will open it.
"""In this program, we will read data from our sample.txt file and print the data on the console."""
This is our main() function.
"""Here, a file variable and a pointer to the file variable is defined."""
Then we have declared a character variable c.
"""Here, we open the file Sample.txt in read mode."""
The output is stored in fp.
Then we check the condition-
"""""""If fp is equal to NULL """"."""
If the condition is true then we print the message:
"""""""File doesn't exist."""""""
"""Else, it will check for another condition- While c is not equal to EOF."
"""Here, EOF is the end of file."""
It denotes the end of input.
It is a condition where no more data can be read from a data source.
"""If the condition is true then it will display the characters from Sample.txt file, on the console."""
"""Here, getc returns a character from a specified file or stream."""
"""Now, it will return a character from our Sample.txt file."""
putchar is used to display a character on the console.
Then it will store the characters in variable c.
Here we close the file.
Come back to the terminal.
"""To compile, type gcc space readfile dot c space hyphen o space read"" Now press Enter ."
"""To execute, type ./read (dot slash read)."""
The output is displayed as: Welcome to the Spoken-Tutorial.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Come back to our slides.
Let us summarize .In this tutorial we learnt:
"""File handling,"""
To write data into a file.
"""eg. fp = fopen(“Sample.txt”, “w”);"""
"""To read data from a file. eg. fp = fopen(“Sample.txt”, “r”);"""
As an assignment- Write a program to create a file TEST. Write your name and address in the file TEST. Then display it on the console using C Program.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on constructor overloading in java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn"""
what is constructor overloading
and  to overload constructor.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 OS Java Development kit 1.6 Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create constructors in java using eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
What is constructor overloading?
Define multiple constructors for a class.
They must  differ in number or types of parameters.
Let us now see how to overload constructor.
"""In eclipse, I have a class Student with two variables and a method."""
Let us first create a parameterized constructor.
"""So, type: Student within  parentheses int number comma String the_name."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: roll_number is equal to number."""
And  name is equal to the_name
"""So, we have a constructor with two parameters."""
Let us call this constructor.
"""So, in main method type: new Student parentheses semicolon."""
"""We see an error, it states that constructor Student is undefined."""
This is simply because we have defined a constructor with two parameters.
And we are calling a constructor without parameters.
"""So, we need to pass arguments."""
"""So, within parentheses type: 22 comma in double quotes Ram."""
We see that the error is resolved.
Let us call the method.
"""So, before new , type: Student s is equal to new student."""
"""Now, using the object s we will call the method   studentDetail()."""
Save  the program and Run.
We see the output: 22 and Ram.
Now let us define a constructor with no parameter.
"""So, type: Student parentheses."""
Within curly brackets roll_number is equal to 0.
And  name is equal to in double quotes hyphen that is no name.
"""So, now we can call the constructor with no parameters."""
"""So, type: Student s1 is equal to new Student parentheses semicolon."""
"""This time we see no error, since we have defined a constructor without parameter."""
Then  s1 dot studentDetail();.
Save and Run the program.
"""So, in  the output  we see zero and dash when the default constructor is called."""
This is constructor overloading.
We have two constructors with different parameters.
Both the constructors obviously have same name.
"""So, depending on the type and number of parameters, the constructor is called."""
Let us see the advantage of constructor overloading.
"""Suppose, now we call a constructor with two parameters."""
"""So, type: Student s3= new Student();"""
"""Now within parentheses,  suppose I gave the name argument first and then the roll_number."""
"""Let's see what happens.So, in double quotes Raju comma 45."""
"""We see an error which states that """"The constructor Student with the parameter  String comma int is undefined."""""""
"""So, let us first define the constructor."""
"""So, type: Student within parentheses String the_name comma int r_no."""
"""So, over here first parameter is string and the second parameter is int."""
"""Then, within curly bracket, roll_number is equal to r_no;"""
and name is equal to the_name;
Save the program.
Now we   see that the error is resolved.
Let us call the method.
"""So, s3 dot studentDetail();"""
Save the program and Run.
"""So, we see the output 45 and Raju."""
"""So, here we see that when we call the constructor"""
we do not have to worry about the parameters that we are passing.
This is simply because we have defined multiple constructors with different parameters.
"""So, the proper constructor is overloaded."""
We can therefore now define  a constructor which takes only one parameter.
That is roll number.
"""So, type: Student within parentheses int num,"""
within curly brackets roll_number is equal to num.
"""And name is equal to """"no name""""."""
"""Now,  let us call this  constructor."""
"""So, type: Student s4 is equal to new Student;.  This time we will pass a single argument. So, let us pass 61."""
Then s4 dot  studentDetail();
"""So, in the output we see  the roll number as 61 and name as no name."""
"""As we can see, the proper overloaded constructor is called when new is executed."""
"""Based upon the parameters specified, the proper constructor is overloaded."""
This is how constructor overloading is done.
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learnt:"""

This brings us to the end of the tutorial.
Welcome to the tutorial on Programming Features of Eclipse.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about"""
the 'user friendly' programming features of Eclipse.
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.0, JDK 1.6, and Eclipse 3.7.0."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have"""
Eclipse installed  on your system and
you must know  how to write a simple java program in Eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorial, please visit our website as shown."""
Eclipse IDE supports many user friendly features such as:
Auto completion  Syntax highlighting
Error dialog box and Shortcut keys.
We will look into each of these features in detail.
I have  created a class named 'Features' and added the main method.
we will first look at Auto completion feature in Eclipse.
"""Inside the main method, type an opening brace and hit Enter."""
We can see that it automatically sets the corresponding closing brace and also positions the cursor with an indentation.
It also completes every feature that works in pairs.
"""For example, parentheses. Type open  parentheses."""
We can see that we only have to type the open parenthesis and eclipse automatically adds the closing parenthesis.
"""Also note that if we are accustomed to type the closing parenthesis also, then it takes care of it by not adding the extra closing parenthesis."""
I’m now typing the closing parenthesis and note that only the cursor moves to the right and the extra parenthesis is not added.
It works in similar fashion with double quotes also.
Type opening quotes and it automatically closes the  quotes.
"""If we are accustomed to type the closing quotes also, it takes care of it by not adding the extra quote."""
I know typing the quote and notice that the cursor moves to the right with  the extra quote is not added.
Auto-completion is a very versatile feature and helps a lot in maintaining the structure of the code
"""and also prevents typing errors like-  missing closing braces, missing closing parentheses and missing closing quotes."""
The next programming feature we will look at is suggestion.
Remove all that we just typed.
We will type the output statement to print the word “hello”. System dot.
Notice that Eclipse displays a drop-down list.
"""The list contains  suggestions like err, in, out, console  all sought of possible  completion."""
"""Scroll down to out and press Enter. Again, type a dot (.)."""
Now Eclipse will provide suggestions from the out module.
"""Scroll down to  println() and press Enter. Now inside the parentheses, in quotes, type Hello."""
The next feature we will be looking at is the Syntax highlighting feature.
"""Note that the keywords public  class, public static void  are all in a different color."""
Also note that the word Hello is in blue color indicating that this is a string.
This 'syntax highlighting' feature helps us to differentiate between  key words and different parts of the code.
Eclipse also helps the programmer to find out errors.
"""In a program, an error is denoted by a red cross symbol on the left margin."""
"""In this program, we can see there is an error and mouse hover on the error."""
We can see that the error says: semi colon (;) missing and the solution  to resolve the error is also shown.
"""If we proceed to the run without fixing the error, right click, select Run as, Java Application."""
"""We have an Error Dialog Box indicating that there is an error,  asking should we proceed or not."""
"""For now, let us proceed. We notice that there is output indicating that there is an error and"""
"""when we go to problem console, all the problems with possible solutions are listed."""
"""So Let us resolve the error by adding a semicolon. Ctrl, S to save."""
The next programmer friendly feature of eclipse is the 'shortcut-keys'.
The common shortcut-keys in any program are Ctrl+S for saving and Ctrl+O for opening.
Eclipse has shortcut keys for many such commonly used functions.
"""Control, F11 is the shortcut for running the code."""
Let us try it now. Hold Ctrl and press F11 and we see that the code is run and the output Hello has been printed.
The shortcut keys for other options can be found by looking at the menu. Click  Run.
"""And Notice that on the right end of the option, there is a shortcut given."""
So the shortcut key for Debug is F11.
This is just a small but most commonly used list of the programming features of Eclipse. We shall look at more  features in subsequent tutorials.
"""This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt how to use programming features of Eclipse such as:"""
Auto completion Syntax highlighting
Error dialog box and Shortcut keys.
As  an assignment for this tutorial:
Write a simple  program with a class that prints “Hello”.
"""In the process, apply all the programming features of Eclipse,"""
observe  the functions.

"""Welcome to  Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""In this tutorial, I will explain you the drawing tools in detail."""
The first drawing tool is Pencil and it works with very hard edges.
"""Here I have drawn a straight line and if I zoom into the image, you can see each pixel is either black or white."""
"""When I select the paint brush for drawing, I get a line which has soft edges."""
"""And when I switch back to zoom, you can see a hard line with visible jaggies when drawn with pencil."""
And when I draw with paint brush I get a soft line.
Back to the pencil here.
You see the pencil is very sharp in the edges and paint brush is smooth.
But you can't see here the jaggies.
This is called trick of the eye.
"""When I enlarge it, you see it here, it's anti-aliased."""
This is the main difference between the pencil and the paint brush.
Otherwise they are nearly equal and their options too.
"""Now, let's start with the paint brush."""
Click on the Paint brush tool in the tool box and you get the options for that.
The Modes are just the same as in the layer modes as you can see here Multiply or Overlay and so on.
Here is the Opacity slider and by using this you can control the visibility and the colour of the line.
"""I slide the value to say 25% and now when I draw, I get a light grey line instead of black."""
And when I cross this line with a new line you can see that the colour gets stronger but it only happens if I go over it with a new line.
I zoom into this part and select a bigger Brush.
"""And now when I draw a line, it's gray."""
And I draw a second line and the intersection of these two lines is dark gray.
"""And now, I draw a third line over here and intersection gets more darker gray but when I paint back with the same line it doesn’t get darker."""
"""So, this works only from stroke to stroke and you can easily paint an area with gray and you don’t have to watch carefully while filling this."""
Here you can see an option called Incremental .
"""When you select Incremental, you get much stronger effect."""
Let's go to the options of the Brushes and here you can see the spacing of this brush is set to 20%.
Brushes is basically a stamp which stamps the same pattern on and on.
"""And when I zoom in here, you can see, after 20% of the size of the brush, there is a next impression of this brush."""
Here each brush overlays itself.
"""When you de-select Incremental option, you can see each stamping of the brush but there is no painting over and I have to start a second line."""
"""And when I select Incremental, I can paint over and over."""
Go back to 100% .
I have covered Opacity and Incremental options.
Let's go back with the opacity with 100% and I can draw again perfect black.
Incremental is meaningful only if you have an opacity lower than 100%.
"""Scale slider controls the size of the pen here and when I slide down to 1, you get a small size of the brush."""
"""When I scale the brush to say 0.05, I can draw a very fine line and I set the slider to say 2 and  I have a broad line."""
Scale basically controls the diameter of the brush and you can also control with the 'square brackets' on the keyboard.
"""With the help of open square bracket, I can reduce the size of brush and with close square bracket, I can increase the size."""
You can see that the brush is nearly invisible.
"""So, I can adjust the size of brush without leaving the area where I paint."""
"""If someone of the GIMP people are looking forward, I would love to have a button to get back the slider to 1."""
"""So, Scale option is covered."""
And I will cover the brush in detail in next tutorial.
"""Here is an option called Pressure sensitivity and I can use it while editing the image. So,"""
"""let's have a look, here, at Opacity."""
"""Now, when I draw without a lot of pressure, you get a line which is gray in colour and when I increase the pressure I get a dark colour and when I decrease the pressure, I get a light coloured line."""
This option is useful if you are painting a mask.
This is quite useful.
Next option is Hardness.
"""When I draw with not much pressure, there is a soft border and when I increase the pressure, the paint brush acts like a pen."""
"""When I select the pencil tool and draw, I get hard border and this can make a hard border if I really press on the tablet."""
I can change the size of the brush with Pressure sensitivity.
I can also change the colour using Pressure sensitivity.
"""So, I select another colour from the background colour, how  this one here?"""
"""So, let's select this red colour."""
"""And for the foreground colour, let's select a nice green."""
"""And when I start painting here with the selected colour, with low pressure I get green and when I am increasing the pressure I get red and if released, I get green or greenish stuff again."""
And in between the colour changes between green and red.
The last option is using colour from the gradients.
"""To select the Gradients, go to File, Dialogs and Gradients."""
Here is the Gradients.
And now I just grab this window and pull it to here and now I have a gradient here.
"""In Gradients, I have a big selection of patterns."""
Let’s select this one and now I go back here.
"""Now, when I am painting, the paint goes through this pattern on the gradient."""
It's quite funny for some things like writing or working with gradients.
It looks like made out of tube or so.
These were the options of the gradient.
These options are common for all the tools which use brushes.
"""i.e,  Pencil, the Paint brush, the Eraser and the Airbrush which has some additional options."""
The Ink has no brush but it has lot of the other options.
"""The Clone tool, the Healing tool , the Perspective clone tool and even tools like Blur/sharpen or dodge/burn have the option of brushes."""
"""Now, let's go back to Pencil and Paint brush."""
Just clear this again.
There are some tricks which you can use here.
The first trick is about drawing a line.
When I try to draw a straight line its a bit difficult.
"""But when I first set one point with a click and press the shift key, I get a straight line."""
Here I have a straight line.
"""The next trick is, just set one point and press Shift + Ctrl and now the rotation of my line is locked to 15 degrees."""
And so I can draw easily straight lines with defined angles.
"""So, what a master piece here."""
There is something else that you can do with this Shift key.
"""For that, select the Gradient tool."""
Draw a line with gradient selected and you get lot of different colours.
I select a small Brush and de-select the Gradient tool and select my standard colours.
"""Now, when I press the Ctrl key, I can select a colour from the line I had drawn and you can see, the foreground colour is changed to the blue tone."""
"""So, I can pick a colour, somewhere out of the image which is quite nice."""
And if you want to paint in something in a picture and it has the colour you need.
Just Ctrl click on it and you have that specific colour on your pallet.
That is a nice trick.
Basically the Eraser tool is the same tool as the pen or the Brush because it's just the opposite of them.
The Eraser also paints but it gives the background color.
You can see it here.
"""But, for that, you should de-select the Pressure  sensitivity and Opacity."""
"""When I just switch the Foreground colour and the Background colour to black and white and switch white as the foreground colour and select the Pen, I can get the same effect as the Eraser."""
After changing the colour erasing gets black.
You can change the Foreground and Background Colour by pressing the X key.
"""I have  covered the Pencil, the Paint brush and also the Eraser in detail."""
"""For more info, go to http://meetthegimp.org and if you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org. Good bye."""

"""Hi, welcome to this spoken tutorial on General Purpose Utilities in Linux."""
"""In this tutorial, we will make ourselves acquainted with some of the most basic yet heavily used commands of Linux."""
The main motivation of this is to give you a head-start about working with Linux.
"""The first command that we will see is the echo command. However, note that linux commands are case sensitive."""
"""Here, all commands and their options are in small letters unless otherwise mentioned."""
This command is used to display some message on the screen. Switch to the terminal.
A general procedure to open a terminal is already explained in another spoken tutorial.
Type at the prompt: echo space Hello World and press Enter.
This prints the customary Hello World message on the screen.
We can also use the echo command to display the value of a variable.
Type at the prompt: echo space dollar SHELL in capital and press Enter.
This outputs the present shell being used.
We can also use escape sequences with echo command.
"""For this, in Linux we need to use the -e (hyphen e) option."""
"""Common escape sequences include \t (backslash t) for tab,  (backslash n) for new line and \c (backslash c) is a escape sequence which when used, causes the prompt to be displayed on the same line."""
This can be useful if say we want a prompt message before entering something.  Type at the prompt echo space minus e within single quote  Enter a command \c (backslash  c) and press Enter.
We will see that the prompt will be displayed after printing Enter a command on the same line.
You may want to know what version of Linux Kernel you are running.
"""To know this and many other characteristics of our machine, we have the uname command. Type at the prompt: uname space hyphen r and press Enter."""
"""To know what is your username, type at the prompt: who space am space I  and press Enter."""
"""This in fact comes from the who command that enlists all the users currently logged into the system, in case your system is a multi-user system."""
Sometimes your login password may get compromised and/or you may want to change it.
"""For this, we have the passwd command. Type at the prompt: p a s s w d and press Enter."""
"""When you type this command, you would be asked to type the current password."""
"""Here, I would be typing my system's current password."""
"""When that is correctly entered, you will have to enter your new password and then retype it to confirm."""
"""But, what if we have forgotten our current password?"""
Then also the password can be changed without knowing the current password  but that can only be done by the root user.
Now who is a root user?
He is a special user with extra privileges.
"""To draw an analogy, we can say a root user is similar to a user in Windows with Administrator status."""
We may be interested in knowing the system date and time. For this we have the date command.
Type date in the terminal and press Enter.
It will show you the present system time and date.
"""As we can see, the date command gives both date and time. This is a very versatile utility and has many options as well."""
Type at the prompt: date space plus  % (percentage sign) capital T  and press Enter.
"""It gives us only the time in hours, minutes and seconds (hh:mm:ss) format."""
Type at the prompt: date space plus %(percentage sign) small h and press Enter.
It gives the name of the month.
Type at the prompt: date space +%(plus  percentage sign) small m and press Enter.
"""It gives the month of the year in numerical format. Here, it is showing 02 for the month of February . Match this according to the output you are getting."""
Type at the prompt: date space +% (plus percentage sign) small y and press Enter.
It gives the last two digit of the current year.
"""We can combine these options as well. For example, type at the prompt: date space plus within double quotes percentage small h percentage small y and press Enter."""
"""Here, it is showing February 11."""
"""Another related command is the cal command. Though not as common, this helps you to see the calender of any month and any year."""
"""To see the current month's calendar, type at the prompt: cal and press Enter."""
"""To see the calendar of any arbitrary month- say December 2070, type at the prompt: cal space 12 space 2070 and press Enter."""
This gives the calendar of December 2070.
"""Before moving ahead, let us discuss a little bit about files and directories."""
"""In Linux, almost everything is a file. Now the question is what is a file?"""
"""In real file, a file is where we store our documents and papers. Similarly, a Linux file is a container for storing information."""
"""Next, what is a directory?"""
A directory can be understood as a collection of files and other (sub)directories.
A directory helps us in organizing our files in a systematic manner .
This is like what we call folders in Windows.
"""When we login into the Linux system, we are by default in a home directory. To see the home directory, type at the prompt:  echo space dollar HOME (in capital) and press Enter."""
"""The next command helps us to see the directory we are currently working in. It is pwd, that stands for present working directory. Type at the prompt: pwd and press Enter."""
"""Once we know of our directory, we would also want to know what are the files and sub-directories in that directory. For this, we have the """"ls"""" command which is probably the most widely used command in Unix"
Type the command ls and press Enter.
Now observe the output.
Files and sub-directories are generally shown with different colours.
"""""""ls"""" is a very versatile command and has many options. Let us see some of them. Type at the prompt:  ls  space  minus minus all and press Enter."""
This shows all the files including the hidden files. Hidden files here are file names starting with dot (.).
"""If we not only want to see the file but also get more information, we can use the """"minus l"""" option."""
Just type the command:  ls space minus small l and press Enter.
"""It gives us the file permissions, file owner's name, last modification time, file size in bytes etc. Explanation of the fields of this option is beyond the scope of the present tutorial."""
"""""""ls"""" can be used with many options which we will see later."""
"""Instead of just displaying all these information on the screen, we may store it in a file. In fact we can store the output of any command in a file in this way."""
Just type the command followed by the right angle-bracket and the file name. Say- we write: ls space minus small l space right angle-bracket space fileinfo and press Enter.
"""Now, all the files and directories information will be directed into the file named """"fileinfo""""."""
"""But how do we see the content of this file? For this, we have the cat command. Just type: cat space and the name of the file, here it is """"fileinfo"""", and press Enter."""
"""Now, you can see its contents. In fact, the other main use of cat is to create a file. For this, type at the prompt: cat space right angle- bracket space filename say file1 and press Enter."""
"""Now when we press Enter, the command waits for input from the user."""
"""Whatever we type, would be written into the file; so type some text."""
"""Now, press Enter key to indicate the end of input."""
"""Now, press the Ctrl and D keys together."""
"""If a file by name say """"file1"""" already exists then the user input will be overwritten on this file."""
"""Now, if you wish to append to the end of an existing file file1, type at the prompt: cat space double right- angle bracket space file1 and press Enter."""
"""There are several other commands that we could have discussed but we would keep it to this for now. In fact, even for all the commands discussed, there are many options and possibilities untouched here."""
"""This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial. Spoken Tutorials are a part of the """"Talk to a Teacher"""" project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""

Welcome to the   tutorial on Errors and Debugging using Eclipse.
"""In this tutorial, we are going to learn:"""
"""what are the possible errors  while writing a simple Java program,"""
how to identify those errors and rectify them using eclipse.
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.10 and Eclipse 3.7."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create and run a Java Program in Eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorial, please visit our website as shown. [1]"""
"""In a simple  Java program, the  typical errors could be:"""
Missing semicolon(;)
"""Missing double quotes("""" """") around the message"""
Mis-match of 'file name' and 'class name' and
Typing the print statement in lower-case.
We shall write a program and then make each of these errors and see what happens in Eclipse.
Here we have the Eclipse IDE and the project used for the  HelloWorld tutorial.
We shall  create  a new  class in the project and use it.  New Class. Let us name the class  ErrorFree and select methods stubs public static void main.
Let us minimize the package explorer. Remove the comments and add the print statement with a few errors.
"""In Eclipse, the line which has the error will be indicated with a red cross mark on the left margin."""
"""In this case, the System.out.println line has an error and hence there is a red cross mark on the left."""
The list of errors is displayed by hovering the mouse over the cross mark.
"""The first error displayed is: syntax error, insert  semi-colon to complete block statements."""
This is because we have to end every statement  of a  program with a semicolon.
"""So, let us insert  semicolon at the end of the statement."""
Save the file with Ctrl s.
"""Notice that once we add the semicolon and save the file, the first error is gone."""
There is only one error now which says: Helloworld cannot be resolved to a variable which means to display any message on the console the message has to be included in double quotes.
"""Without the quotes, Java thinks that HelloWorld is the name of a variable."""
Let us add double quotes before and after the message.
"""Ctrl s  to Save. We see that the red-cross mark is gone and the program is error free. So, let us run the program and see what happens."""
Run as > Java application
We see that the message has been printed on the console.
Let us look at the next error.
It happens due to a mismatch of the file name and class name.
It does not  happen usually on Eclipse.
This is because we use the New Class wizard to create a file and eclipse creates a file automatically.
"""But, if we create a Java file outside of Eclipse and add it to a project, there is a chance of the error."""
"""So, let us stimulate the error by changing  the class name."""
"""Since Java is case sensitive, now the class name and file name do not match ."""
Notice that there is a red cross mark on the left margin.
And error message reads: The public type errorfree must be defined in its own file.
Also notice that the word errorfree is underlined in red colour.
Eclipse offers intelligent fixes and we have 2 fixes available here.
The first one is Rename compilation unit to errorfree java.
The second one is Rename the type to errorfree.
"""The fix that we are looking for is the second one. And we see that once you rename the file, the class back to 'ErrorFree', the error here is missing."""
The next error happens due to typing mistakes in the print statement.
Let us replace the capital S with a small s.
We notice that there is the  red-cross mark
and error message reads:  system cannot be resolved.
"""This means, Java is expecting a class or object or a  variable by the name 'system'."""
But there is nothing like 'system' object in the code.
"""So, let us look at the possible fixes."""
"""There are 11 fixes. Out of these, the fix that we are looking for is the eighth option:"""
Change to 'System' (java.lang).
"""You can see that once we change it to capital 'S', the error is missing."""
"""Here is  how you identify errors in Java, using eclipse, and rectify them."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
In this tutorial we have seen:
what are the typical errors while writing a Java program and
how to identify them and rectify them using Eclipse.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial,  find out the errors in the code given below and fix them."""

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on creating multidimensional arrays in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to- create multidimensional array in awk  and  scan the multidimensional array."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
You can use any text editor of your choice.
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through previous awk tutorials on array, on this website."""
You should have some basic knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
What is a multidimensional array in awk?
"""We know that in single dimensional arrays, an array element is identified by a single index."""
"""For example, array week is identified by a single index, day."""
"""However, in multidimensional array, an element is identified by a sequence of multiple indices."""
"""For example, a two dimensional array element is identified by a sequence of 2 indices."""
"""Here, multiple indices are concatenated into a single string, with a separator between them."""
The separator is the value of the built-in variable SUBSEP.
The combined string is used as a single index for a simple one dimensional array.
"""For example, suppose we write multi within square brackets 4 comma 6 equal to value in double quotes."""
"""Here, multi is the name of multi-dimensional array.  Then, the numbers 4 and 6 are converted to a string."""
"""Suppose, the value of SUBSEP is hash symbol (#)."""
"""Then, those numbers are concatenated with a hash  (#) symbol between them."""
"""So, the array element multi within square brackets within double quotes 4 hash 6 is set to value within double quotes."""
The default value of SUBSEP is the string within double quotes backslash 034.
It is actually a nonprinting character. It will not appear usually in most input data.
Let us try to declare a two dimensional array as shown in the slide.
Row 1 contains two elements A and B.
Row 2 has two elements C and D.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you have downloaded and extracted the Code Files using 'cd' command.
"""Now, define the array as follows. Type the command carefully as shown here. Then press Enter."""
"""We get a command prompt back without any error. So, the array is defined."""
We do not get any output because we have not given anything to print in the code.
Let us add the print statement.
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command in the terminal.
"""Just before the closing curly bracket, type:  semicolon space print space a within square brackets 2 comma 2. Press Enter to execute the command."""
"""Notice, we get the output as capital D."""
How to test if a particular index sequence exists in a given multidimensional array?
We can use in operator.
We have already seen it in single-dimensional array earlier in this series.
We have to write the entire sequence of indices within parentheses and separated by commas.
Let us see this in an example.
I have already written a script named test_multi.awk.
The same is available in the Code Files link of this tutorial page.
I have defined a 2 by 2 array as seen in our previous discussion.
Then I have written two 'if' conditions.
"""The first if condition checks whether the element at the index one comma one, is present or not."""
We have to write the index for multidimensional array within parentheses.
"""If the condition is true, it will print one comma one is present."""
"""Else, it will print one comma one is absent."""
"""Similarly, we will check for the presence of the element at index three comma one. Let us execute the file."""
Switch to the terminal and type: awk space hyphen small f space test underscore multi dot awk and press Enter.
The output says: one comma one is present and three comma one is absent.
"""Let us take one more example. Say, we want to create the transpose of a matrix."""
The transpose of a given matrix is formed by interchanging the rows and columns of a matrix. How can we do this?
I have created a two-dimensional array matrix in the file 2D-array.txt.
I have written a code named transpose.awk.
"""First, look at the action section of this awk script."""
"""Here, we are calculating the maximum number of fields in a row. And, stored the calculated value in the variable max_nf."""
"""As we know, NR is the number of current records processed by awk. Value of NR is stored in max_nr variable."""
Awk will process the input file from the first record to the last record.
"""When awk is processing the first record, max_nr will be equal to 1."""
"""While processing second record, max_nr will be 2 and it continues this way."""
"""When awk is processing the last record, max_nr will store the total number of records."""
"""Now, we should read the data from input file and store the data into a two dimensional array."""
"""Inside the 'for' loop, we have iterator variable x."""
x will traverse from one to NF and x will be incremented by 1 after each iteration.
"""For every value of x, $x(dollar x) represents the value at field x."""
That value will be stored in array matrix at index NR comma x.
"""For example, matrix of 1 comma 1 stores the value which is present at index 1 comma 1 from the input file."""
"""So, after awk has processed the entire input file with this code, matrix array will be completely formed."""
It will store entire data of input file into a two dimensional array format.
"""Now, let’s us look inside the END section."""
We have written a nested for loop to print the transpose of the matrix.
"""I assume your familiarity with basic C programming. So, I am not explaining this portion of code in detail."""
Pause the video here to look at the code in detail and understand on your own.
"""Now, we will learn how to scan a multidimensional array."""
Awk does not have a multi-dimensional array in the truest sense.
"""So, there cannot be any special 'for' statement to scan the multidimensional array."""
You can have multidimensional way to scan an array.
You can combine the 'for' statement with the split function for this.
Let us see what the split function is. split function is used to chop up or split a string into pieces
and place the various pieces into an array.
The syntax is as follows. First argument contains the string to be chopped.
Second argument specifies the name of the array where split() will put the chopped pieces into.
The third argument mentions the separator that will be used to chop the string up.
"""The first piece is stored in  arr 1,"""
the second piece in arr 2 and so forth.
"""Suppose, we want to recover the original sequence of indices from an already created array. How can we do this?"""
I have written a code named multi_scan.awk.
Entire code is written inside the BEGIN section.
First we have created an array named a and assigned these values to it.
Then we have the for loop with an iterator.
"""The iterator will be set to each of the indices values for each iteration- say, 1 comma 1, then 1 comma 2 and so on."""
The  split() function breaks the iterator into pieces separated by SUBSEP.
The pieces will be stored in the array arr.
"""So, arr[1] and arr[2] will contain the first index and second index respectively. Let us execute this  file."""
Switch to the terminal and type- awk space hyphen small f space multi underscore scan dot awk  and press Enter.
See the output; the original sequence of indices are recovered.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt to- create a multidimensional array in awk and scan a multidimensional array."""
"""As an assignment, write an awk script to  rotate a two dimensional array by 90 degree and print the rotated matrix."""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on String Library Functions in C.
In this tutorial we will learn String Library Functions.
We will do this with the help of some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using ""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10, gcc Compiler Version 4.6.1."
Let us start with an introduction to string library functions.
These are the group of functions implementing operations on strings.
"""Various operations such as copying, concatenation, searching etc are supported."""
Let us see some of the string library functions.
Here we have the strncpy function.
"""The syntax for this is strncpy(char str1, char str2, and int n );"""
It copies first n characters of string str2  into string str1.
"""example, char strncpy( char hello, char world, 2);"""
The output will be Wollo .
Here we have Wo from the string 2 and rest of the characters from string 1.
"""Now we will see strncmp function, the syntax for this is strncmp(char str1, char str2, and int n);"""
It will compare first n characters of string 2 with string 1.
"""example int strncmp(char ice, char icecream, and  2);"""
The output will be 0.
Now we will see how to use the string library functions.
I am going to show you some of the commonly used string functions.
"""I have already typed the program on the editor,"""
"""Here, we have the string length function."""
Note that our file name is strlen.c.
"""In this, we will find the length of the string."""
These are the header files as stdio.h and string.h.
Here we have a character variable  'arr'.
It stores a value  'Ashwini' .
Then we have an integer variable len1 .
Here we will find the length of the string using strlen function.
The result will be stored in 'len1'.
Then we print the string and the length of the string.
Now let us execute the program.
"Open the terminal window by pressing ""Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type:  """"gcc""""  space  """"strlen.c""""  space  “-o” space “str1”.  Press Enter."""
Type (dot slash) ./str1. Press Enter.
The output is displayed as
"""string = Ashwini, Length = 7"""
"""You can count here. 1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7."""
Let us see another string function.
Here we have the string copy function.
Note that our file name is strcpy.c .
"""In this, we will copy the source string into the target string."""
"""Here we have 'Ice' in the source string, it will be copied to the target string."""
This is our strcpy function
Here we will print the source string and the target string.
Let us execute and see.
Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type gcc space strcpy.c space hyphen  o space str2. Press  Enter"""
Type (dot slash)./str2 . Press Enter .
The output is displayed as:
source string = Ice
target string = Ice
Now let us see another string function.
Now we will see the string compare function.
Note that our file name is strcmp.c.
"""In this, we will compare two strings."""
Here we have character variables as str1 and str2 .
str1 stores the value as  'Ice' and str2 stores the value as  'Cream'.
Here we have integer variables as i and j.
In this we will compare the string using the strcmp function.
Here we compare str1 i.e 'Ice' with 'Hello'.
The result is stored in i.
In this we will compare string2 i.e 'Cream' with 'Cream'
The result is stored in j.
Then we print both the results.
To compile type gcc space strcmp.c space hyphen o space str3
Type (dot slash) ./str3
"""The output is displayed as 1, 0."""
Here we get 1 and here we get as 0.
Let us come back to our slides.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learned,String library functions-"""
strlen()
strcpy()
strcmp() strncpy()
and strncmp().
"As an assignemnt, write a C Program to concatenate String 'best' and String 'bus'."
"""Hint: strcat(char str1, char str2);"""
Also explore the other functions in string library.

Thank you for joining.
Hello and welcome to this Spoken Tutorial on User-defined functions in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about- syntax of function definition, function call and 'Return' statement."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and   gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the earlier awk tutorials on this website."""
You should have some knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
"""Now, let us learn about user defined functions. The function syntax is as follows."""
"""And, the syntax is self-explanatory."""
"""Here, the keyword function is mandatory."""
"""To call a function, write the name of the function followed by the arguments in parentheses."""
Note: space is not allowed between the function name and the open parentheses of the argument.
We will see one example now.
"""In our awkdemo.txt file, the sixth field represents stipend."""
Assume that stipend is either zero or consists of four digits.
"""Suppose, stipend is 8900. Print it as 8 thousand 9 hundred in words."""
"""If stipend is 0, print as zero in words."""
I have already written the code in a file named user_function.awk
"""Here, I have written a function named changeit with a single argument 'argval'."""
"""Here, argval is basically our sixth field which is stipend."""
"""Inside the function, the first code will check if argval is zero or not."""
"""If yes, it will print “Zero” in words."""
"""If not, then  else part of the code will be executed."""
"""In the else part, first we will extract each digit one by one using the substring function."""
"""And, we'll store the values in an array a at different indices."""
For example- a[1]  will give the first digit from left hand side or the thousand’s place digit.
"""Since we have only four digits, I have used four indices."""
"""Next, we will check whether the elements are not equal to zero. And print them in a proper order."""
"""At the end, we print a backslash n character to provide a new line break in the output."""
"""Then, inside the awk script, we have printed dollar 2 which is the second field that is name."""
Then we call the function changeit with the parameter dollar 6 which is stipend. Let’s execute the file.
"""Switch to the terminal. Next, go to the folder where you have downloaded and extracted the file using cd command."""
"""Now, type the following command and press Enter."""
We get the output as expected.
An user-defined function can also include a return statement.
This statement returns control to the calling part of the awk program.
It can also be used to return a value for use in the rest of the awk program.
"""It looks like this: return space expression. Here, the expression part is optional."""
Let’s write a function to return average of an array.
I have written the code in the file average.awk Let’s view the contents.
We have defined a function named avg for this purpose.
It has five parameters. arr is the array for which the average is to be calculated.
i is array loop variable.
sum is the summation of all array elements.
n indicates the number of elements in array.
ret represents the variable to be returned from the function avg. ret will store the calculated average.
"""The extra space before i indicates that the variables i, sum, n  and ret are local variables."""
"""Actually, the local variables are not intended to be arguments."""
You should follow this convention when defining functions.
"""Inside the for loop, we have calculated the total number and summation of array elements."""
We have calculated the average by dividing summation with the total number of elements and stored that value in variable ret.
This function avg() returns the value of the variable ret.
"""Inside the BEGIN section, we have defined array nums with 5 different numbers."""
"""In the print statement, we call the function avg() with one argument which is the array name."""
"""So, you do not have to pass local variables as arguments."""
Switch back to the terminal. Let me clear the terminal.
Type the following command- awk space hyphen f space average dot awk. Press Enter.
We get the output as 3.6. You can validate it by using a calculator.
Let us look at one more example.
I have written a code to reverse a string and named it as reverse.awk. recursive function is used to reverse a string.
Pause the video here and look at the code to understand how the control flows. Then execute it to see the output.
"""As an assignment, use the function rev to reverse the Roll number field in awkdemo.txt file."""
"""For example, if the roll number is A001, output should be 100A."""
The code for the same is provided as reverse_roll.awk in the Code Files link.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learnt about- syntax of function definition,"""
function call and Return statement.
As an assignment- Write a function to create a transpose of a 2D matrix.
Write a function to return the minimum value element from an array.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on how to add an Item type in the Koha interface.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about Item types and  how to add an Item type."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux Operating System 16.04 and   Koha version 16.05."""
"""To follow this tutorial, learner should have knowledge of Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have Koha installed on your system."""
"""And, You should have Admin access in Koha. If not, please refer to the Koha spoken tutorial series on this website."""
Let us begin. Let me switch to the Koha interface.
Recall that we had created a Superlibrarian Bella.
We will now login with username Bella and her password.
Now we are inside the Koha interface as Superlibrarian Bella.
"""Before we move ahead, let’s first understand what are Item Types."""
"""Item types typically refer to the material in the library, such as- Books, Journals, CDs/DVDs etc."""
Every Item type in Koha has a Collection code assigned to it.
This code uniquely identifies that Item type.
Let us learn to add a new item type.
"""On the Koha Home page, click on Koha Administration."""
Go to the section Basic parameters and click on Item Types.
Click the ' New Item Type' button at the top of the Item types administration page.
"""In the Item type field, enter a code for the new item type that you want to add."""
I will type REF.
The Description field is the description of the item type.
"""So here, I will type """"Reference"""". I will skip Search category field."""
Next is Choose an icon:.
Click on the tab bridge .
"""Here, from the below given options, click on the icon to be associated with the item type."""
I will select this Reference icon.
"""Next, we will learn how Hide in OPAC: helps."""
Let’s say a book is damaged and/or has to be kept back for binding purpose.
"""In such cases, the option Hide in OPAC, will make the book invisible to all the users."""
"""As per your requirement, check or uncheck the checkbox for Hide in OPAC:. I will leave the checkbox blank."""
Use the 'Not for loan' option for items which are kept in the library but not circulated.
"""For e.g :  Reference books,  Rare books , Dictionary etc."""
"""You may enter an amount to be charged in the Rental charge field, if you wish to. Particular items in the library may have to be charged a minimum rental fee."""
"""I will not enter any fee, as rental fee is not required to be charged on most items."""
"""If you wish to enter a fee, then remember to enter a valid number only."""
Next is the 'Checkin message:' text field.
Checkin message depends on the type of the particular item.
"""The options could be- Book ,  Serial, Cds/DVDs,  Bound Volume,  Microfilm etc."""
"""In the field Checkin message:, I will type Bound Volume."""
This is followed by Checkin message type:.
"""Depending upon the item type, select a message or an alert for the item."""
"""Remember, as per the selected option a message or an alert will be displayed when check-ins are done for this particular item."""
I will select- message.
Next is SIP media type. SIP media type applies only if a sorter or a locker facility is being used in your library.
"""So here, I’am skipping SIP media type."""
"""In the Summary field, write a summary of the respective item , if you want to."""
I will type- Item type- Reference Facilitate- Self check out/return.
"""Lastly, click on Save changes button."""
A new page Item types administration opens up.
"""All the details that were filled for the new item type, appear in a tabular form  on the page Item types administration."""
Some important things to note are-
Collection codes assigned to item types cannot be edited.
"""Description of the item type can be edited.  Once an item type is used by items in the library, it cannot be deleted."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt-  about Item types and  how to add an Item type."""
As an assignment- add a new item-  Book and   Serial  to your library.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Default constructor in java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
About the default constructor.
And  to create a constructor.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 Java Development Environment jdk 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create a class and the object of the class in java using eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown.http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
Constructor is used to initialize the instance variables.
It is called at the creation of new object.
Let us now see how a constructor is defined in java.
"""So, in the eclipse, I have already created a java file  Student.java."""
In the Student class we will declare two variables.
So type int roll_number semi-colon and String name semicolon.
Now let us create a method.
"""So, type: void studentDetail()."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: System dot out dot println roll_number;"""
Then System dot out dot println name;.
Now in main method we will call this method.
"""So, let us create an object and call the method."""
"""So, type: Student object name stu equal to new Student()."""
Then stu dot method name i.e studentDetail.
We see the output 'zero' and 'null'.
"""So, the int variable roll_number has been initialized to its default value 'zero'."""
And the String name has been initialized to its default value 'null'.
If we do not define a constructor then a default constructor is created.
Default constructor has no parameters.
It initializes the instance variables to their default value.
Now let us define a constructor.
"""So, type: Student S capital parenthesis and curly brackets."""
"""Remember, the Constructor has the same name as the 'class name' to which it belongs."""
Constructors are also similar to methods but there are some important differences.
We see the same output.
This is because the constructor  that we defined is same as having no constructor.
"""But here, no default constructor is created because we have defined a constructor."""
"""Now, let's give values to our variables."""
"""So, inside the constructor type: roll_number equal to ten semicolon."""
And name equal to within double quotes Raman.
Now  Save and Run the program.
We see in the output that the roll_number  is ten and the name is Raman.
"""So, the constructor initializes the instance field."""
"""Now, let us see some differences between  method and a constructor."""
Constructor does not have  a return type.
whereas method has a return type.
Constructor is called using the new operator.
whereas the  method is called using the dot operator.
"""So, these were some differences between constructor and method."""
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
About the default constructor.
To define a constructor.
And Differences between method and constructor.
"""For self assessment, create a class Employee with variables and a  method to display variables."""
And create a constructor for the class Employee.

This tutorial is contributed by Viswa Janani Vasudhevan and Madhuri Ganapathi. Thank you for joining.
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on presentation using Latex and Beamer.
Let me first explain the arrangement that I have on the screen.
"""I have the source file here, I will do the compilation here using pdflatex command"""
and the resulting output will be seen here in this corner.
"""First let's see this, we will come back to this shortly."""
"""Let's do this first. The first slide here, comes from this source – begin frame, end frame, title page."""
"""And the title page is defined in terms of title, author and date."""
"""The document class that I am using is """"beamer"""". We have begun the document here."""
"""Alright, this is the first slide. Let's go to the second one. This is the outline. How is this created?"""
"""Begin frame, end frame define one slide. Frame title is """"outline"""". It comes here."""
Then I use the normal itemized command. Let’s go to the third slide.
This slide talks about other spoken tutorials on Latex. There are many spoken tutorials on Latex already available.
You are encouraged to see them in case you are not comfortable in using latex.
"""These explain how to use latex, this explains how to install and run latex on Windows."""
And we hope to give more permanent links for all of these from fosse dot in.
"""So, this is the source for this slide."""
You can see that we have come to the end of this document.
Now I’m going to show you how to embellish this document with lots of other features that beamer offers.
"""Let’s go to the beginning. Let’s go to the top of this file. Now what I am going to do is, whatever change,"""
whatever improvement that I am going to make to this are here. I am going to add one at a time and then explain.
Let’s see what happens when I add this command - beamer theme split.
"""Let me cut it, come back here, let me save it and then compile it – pdflatex beamer."""
Let me go and click this. So you can see that it has created this banner here and some banner here.
"""Here also.. alright. Then what we do is, you come here and use the package."""
"""Let's add this – beamer theme shadow. Let me cut it, go here, paste it. All of these are pasted above the """"document"""" command."""
"""Let me compile this. Alright, let’s see what happens when I click this. It has become bigger."""
"""You can see that there is a change of color here. So, this is done by the command – beamer theme shadow."""
There are lots of these packages. I am going to illustrate some of the other features now.
"""We will give references for future reading as a part of this introduction, as we see here – ‘References for further reading’."""
"""The outline of this talk is as follows. We will spend some time on title page, author name, color, logo etc."""
"""""""Minimal animation"""" that you can use to present your talk, """"Two column format, Figures and Tables, Equations, Verbatim"""" and so on."""
"""Alright, let’s come back to the beginning. The next one is logo. Let’s cut and paste logo from here."""
"""This also has to be pasted above the begin document command. This logo, let’s see what this looks like."""
Let me just see it by open iitb logo.pdf. I am giving the same name over here.
"""When I open it, you can see that this is the image file that I am talking about."""
"""On including this """"logo"""" command, of height 1 cm. it is going to come in this corner."""
So let’s see what it looks like. Let’s click this. You can see that iitb logo has come.
"""Now this is going to come on every page, from now on."""
"""Next, we will add this command. For presentations, sometimes it is useful to make all the lettering bold."""
"""So in view of that, I will include this, cut, paste."""
Actually I will have to include this after the begin document command.
"""Let me save this. Let me compile it. Alright now, watch this. As I click this, all the letters will become bold."""
You can see that it has become bold.
"""Then, now I am going to improve the writing here."""
"""For example, it tries to fill lots of things here. Here, the title comes here, here the author information comes but lots of information is coming."""
"""Sometimes I may want to have a smaller title here. For example, this space may not be large enough."""
"""So what we will do is, that is solved using this."""
"""For example, this is the running title."""
"""Let me cut this. This should come after the command title, between the title command and the actual title."""
"""So, let me paste it here. You can see that whatever I have pasted now is within square brackets."""
So let’s save it. Run it.
"""So, as I do it, let’s click this. Look at this as I click what happens to this part."""
"""You can see that the title has now changed. I have put only the bottom portion because that’s what I’m giving within the square bracket – """"Presentation using LaTeX and Beamer""""."""
Then I am saying that h-space is half a cm. I am giving a space here. And then I have the page number over here.
It says 1 by 3 here. Then 2 by 3 here. 3 by 3 here and so on.
That is achieved using ‘insert frame number divided by insert total frame number’.
"""Now, I will do the same thing for author. So, let's come here."""
"""Let’s cut this. And after author, this comes."""
Let me save it. Compile it. Click this.
You can see that Kannan Moudgalya has come. This is what I have given within the square brackets. Now this is going to come on every page.
Let’s go to the next topic. This is including equations.
The whole thing is in the form of a frame – a complete frame.
"""So, what I will do is, I will cut the whole thing."""
"""Come back here, go to the bottom of this document. Save it."""
"""So, I have created a new slide. Let’s see what this looks like."""
So this is where the frame starts.
"""Let us compile this. Now you see that 4 pages are there. So, it still says three, so if I click this once more, so it becomes 4."""
So this is the equation containing slide. I am not going to explain how to write these equations.
These are explained in the spoken-tutorial that I have created earlier on creating equations.
"""All that I have done is, I went to that latex document, cut and pasted it here, that’s all."""
And.. of course I have removed the equation numbers. It does not make sense to give equation numbers in a slide.
"""On the other hand, it may be useful for you at times to highlight the color."""
"""For example- if I want to change this into blue, I will do the following. Come here."""
"""The command is – color, blue- and then I have to close this."""
Save it. Compile it. And click this. You can see that this has become blue.
"""So, you may not want to refer to an equation by numbers but you can say that consider the equation in blue or you may want to say that look at the mass balance equation and so on."""
You want to refer to it by something that people can remember in talks.
"""Next what we will do is, what I will do now is to include animation"""
which is useful to present information concept by concept.
"""So I have cut, let's paste it here. Let us see what this looks like."""
Let's first compile it and see what happens.
This is from the spoken tutorial on letter writing. This information is also there.
"""The only difference that I have done now is that between begin enumerate and end enumerate, I have put this ‘item plus minus alert’."""
"""Let’s see what this does. See, here I have put a command called ‘pause’, so the moment I put a command pause, it stops there, now the begin enumerate starts."""
"""So, let me just go forward. Page-down. Next page, next page, next page."""
"""As I go down, you see that the latest information is in red, all others are in the default color namely black. I have come to the end of the document."""
"""So, this is one easy way to create animation where you want to present information a little at a time."""
"""Next what I want to do is- change the alerted color to blue. For example, here the alerted color is red, this is known as alerted color."""
I want to make this alerted color blue. So that this is consistent with this color that I have chosen.
"""Okay, let me come here, cut this."""
This should go to the beginning of this document before the begin document command.
"""Let me compile it, when I click this you can see now that the alerted color has now become blue."""
"""It is achieved through the command ‘set beamer color – alerted text’ there is a space here ‘foreground equals blue’, fg equals blue."""
"""Now what I am going to do is- to show,  how easy it is to change the color of the entire document."""
"""So, what I will do is.. will come here, after this slash document class, before the beamer frame starts. I will write here """"brown""""."""
Save it. Compile it.
You can see that it has become brown. So without too much work.
"""So what I will do is, I will take this back to the original color."""
"""The default color is blue, so I don’t have to type it. Now we are back in blue."""
"""So let’s come here, I will delete this. I will now include figures."""
Cut this. Come here. Go to the end of this.
"""The last one. Let’s compile it. Let’s go to the next page. So, example of the figure is given here."""
"""Alright, what are the guidelines in placing this? There are some important guidelines. We will see it with the next bit."""
Let’s cut this. Paste this. Compile it.
"""So, I have got this. """"Hints for including figures""""."""
"""Let’s come to the source where we created the figure. This is how we created this figure. So, what are the guidelines?"""
"""""""Do not use floated environments in presentations"""". for example, don’t say 'begin figure, end figure' which you need in the latex documents."""
"""By the way, if you want to know about how to include a figure and more about it you have to go to the spoken tutorial on Tables and Figures."""
"""So, do not use this. Use ‘include graphics’ directly."""
"""So, for example, include graphics command is used and I’m saying that use the complete width of the text and the file is 'iitb'."""
"""By the way, Beamer already comes with necessary packages. So, you don’t have to include any package. Use any package, it is already included."""
And then we put the whole thing in the center environment. And this frame is over.
"""Do not include caption, figure number etc."""
Once again people are not going to remember these numbers.
"""If you want to refer to a previously shown figure, show it again."""
It does not cost any money to create another slide. Make a copy of the earlier shown slide and do it again.
"""Alright, that completes the figure and the guidelines. And we have come to the end of this document."""
Let us now see how to include a two column environment.
Let’s come here. Let’s go to the end of the document. Save it.
"""What I will do is to make it easier, I will first remove this so that it becomes easy."""
"""So, what I’m going to do is- I’m going to give, show part of the information. Let’s compile this and see what happens."""
"""So I have this, two columns."""
"""This is not saved, that is why. See the star star. What I will do is, let me first save it."""
"""So, this is the problem if you try to compile it without saving. The pdf file that you see here, does not correspond to what you have here."""
"""So, let’s compile this. Let’s come here. Now what you see here corresponds to what you have here."""
"""Let me just center it. So, frame title 'Two Columns' and I’m using the command ‘mini page’ and I’m centering it and I’m using 45 percent of the text width."""
begin enumerate. These two and then end enumerate. And as before I am alerting.
"""See these two. This is the end of the document. Now what I will do is, I will come and attach whatever I had at the end of this."""
"""Here, the previous 'mini page' got over. Now I am going to create another mini page. In this 'mini-page', I am going to put this iitb, the same image that we saw earlier."""
"""And this mini-page also is 45 percent size. Let’s compile this, let’s first save this."""
"""Now let me click this. Now you see it has come. But it has a small problem in that. When I go to this page, it shows the first item and also this figure."""
"""Although the figure comes later on, it shows this because no where have we told latex to show this later. It is perhaps implicit."""
"""So for example, if you say that, if you put this information within this item then we say that show this first and then show this."""
But no where are we saying that this should come later.
So one has to be careful of such evinces. One way to solve this problem is to put a ‘pause’.
Let me compile this. Save this. So now this is okay.
"""This problem is solved. The first one, the second one, and then one more, it pauses once. And, you can see that it has been solved."""
"""Alright, let’s come here. The next one is the table."""
Save this. Let’s compile this. You can see that the table has come.
"""I am not going to explain how to create this table, this has already been explained in the spoken tutorial on tables."""
All that I have done is to cut and to paste it here. Let’s go to the beginning of the frame.
"""It’s the same table that we used earlier, I just cut and pasted it. You can see the begin tabular and end tabular commands coming within center environment."""
OK..What are the guidelines? The guidelines are similar to figures.
"""So, let’s see that also. See the guidelines are here."""
"""Let me compile. See this, move forward."""
"""Once again, do not use floated environments in presentations."""
"""In the spoken tutorial on tables, we put the tabular inside the table environment."""
"""Table environment is a floated one, do not include it here. Insert it directly."""
"""For example, we put it directly inside the center environment."""
"""Do not include caption, table number etc. make a copy of it, if required."""
"""Now, here I want to point out the way animation happens. For example, in this slide, it does not alert with a different color."""
Recall that we used the blue color for alerting. Why does it happen?
That is because we have used a different kind of environment here.
"""begin itemize, end itemize, within that we used item plus minus. Previously we were using the word 'alert'."""
"""Recall that. We are not using that anymore. As a result, it just comes in black. This is simpler way to include animation."""
"""You can pick and choose. So, this is what I have written here. """"Show different animations in the previous slide""""."""
"""Now, there is a need to convert this into a handout. For example- if you try to print this,"""
"""whatever we have here, it will produce 24 pages even though there are only 10 pages."""
"""There are only 10 unique frames but there are 24 pages. But if you try to print out, it will produce 24 pages."""
"""One way to do that, to take care of this is to use a simple switch here called 'handout'."""
"""If I do this, let me compile it; now there are only 10 pages. Let’s compile this once more."""
"""Now the animation is no longer there. If I go to the next page, next page, next page, next page, next page and so on."""
"""Of course, what if I want to change the color? Then you put 'brown' once again."""
"""You can see that it has changed. So, all the parameters here are to be included separated by commas."""
"""So, let me just put this back to blue. Compile it."""
"""Now what we will do is, sometimes you have to include Verbatim environment."""
"""So, let me just take this example."""
"""Let’s go here, go to the end. Save it. So this is where the verbatim begins."""
So you can see that the verbatim is created.
"""Here, I have illustrated it with some SciLab commands. I have changed the color here to blue, here to blue and so on."""
The only unique thing that you have to do is to say begin frame within square bracket – fragile.
"""If you don’t do that, there will be a problem. Okay.. so you see this, we will come back and check that."""
So suppose I delete this. Save it. Compile it.
It will come and say that something is not okay.
"""So, let's put this back – fragile. Save it, exit from here."""
Compile it once again. It has come now.
Beamer class has lots of information. How does one know about other things.
"""So, I have some information here, let’s go to the bottom."""
"""So essentially that information, where to get this extra information is in this slide."""
"""We will compile it and we will go through that. The authoritative source for beamer is this file, 'beamer user guide dot pdf'."""
I located it at this point but it is also available through this beamer project website by the author of beamer class.
I’ll just illustrate this; I’ve already downloaded this. It’s in that site that I have mentioned earlier.
"""For example, it’s a 224 page document. It’s a huge document."""
What I want to show here is that you can use the information from here directly.
"""So let’s come here. In the very first page, the author talks about how to create simple slides and he has given the source also."""
"""We will cut this, copy, let me minimize this. Let me go to the end of the document."""
We paste it. Save it. Compile it. So let’s go to the next page.
You can see that whatever we saw there has come here. Here the author has used what is known as the theorem environment.
"""So, for example- begin theorem, end theorem, it comes here. He has also used the frame subtitle that comes here in small letters."""
"""And then begin proof, end proof come here. He says 'proof', it opens another window, calls it ‘proof dot’."""
"""This is how it is defined, how this environment is defined. He uses a different alert mechanism."""
"""So if you want to see this, you just go back; remove this handout so that we can see the animation. Compile it."""
So let’s go to page number 34.
"""Let’s see the animation now by going backwards. You see this, you see this."""
"""So what he does here is, so these two items are numbered one, and the others are numbered two and three."""
"""In other words, it is possible to arbitrarily specify the sequence in which the things that you have on the slide will appear."""
We don’t have time to go through this in more detail. I would suggest that you go through the reference given here to know more about it.
"""This guide has lots of features, this beamer class has very large number of classes, and you may want to try out some of them."""
Okay. Let me change this back to handout.
"""The problem with the presentation mode, we are now going to the handout mode,"""
"""the presentation mode where you show the animations, generally takes a lot of time to compile."""
"""So, typically you would want to work with the handout mode as much as possible and only once in a while when you really want to check it out you want to use the presentation mode."""
"""Finally of course, when you make the presentation, you may want to use the presentation mode."""
"""And if you want to take a printout, use the handout mode. Let’s go to the end. We are almost at the end of the spoken tutorial."""
"""Let’s acknowledge. In fact let me just copy the whole thing, come here."""
Let me just compile it here as usual. Okay.
The funding for this spoken tutorial has come from the National Mission on Education through ICT. This is the website of this mission.

Hello everyone.Welcome to the tutorial on Netbeans Debugger.
"""If this is the first time you are using Netbeans, please view the earlier tutorials on the Spoken Tutorial website."""
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System Ubuntu version 12.04"""
and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
We all know that debugging programs can be a rather painstaking task.
"""Hence, knowing a debugging tool and being familiar with its features can help you save valuable time."""
"""This powerful debugging tool is very useful,"""
especially when you have to code or test large programs.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn some of the features that the Netbeans Debugger provides."""
This tutorial will acquaint you with-
the debugging window
configuring breakpoints
evaluating expressions  or setting watches
options for tracing the execution of your program and
options to configure the debugger itself.
"""Now, Let's get started and debug this sample code."""
I will switch to the Netbeans IDE.
"""I have already created a Java Application- sampleDebug, in my IDE, for this demonstration."""
"""This is a small program that initializes three integer values a, b, and c."""
"""Then it prints """"Hello World!"""" and the value of a."""
"""It also creates a class object SampleClass which has a 'value' integer, as a private integer value."""
"""Then, it computes the value of  b"""
"""and calls a function to compute the value of c,"""
and prints the values of b and c.
"""To start with the debugging, let us first set the break-point."""
"""To set a break point, click on the line number."""
"""I will set it at this line which prints """"Hello World!""""."""
"""Notice that the line at which a break-point is set, changes it's colour to pink and is marked by a small square against its line number."""
"""When you run the program in the debugging mode,"""
"""by clicking on the Debug Project button in the toolbar,"""
the execution of the program stops at the line at which the breakpoint is located.
"""So far, as value has been set."""
Hover on it to check it's value.
It indicates that it's value is 10.
You can see that there are some additional windows below the workspace.
There is a 'Variables' window that shows a list of variables and their values.
"""So far, only the variable a has been initialized."""
We can also look at the Output window with the sampleDebug output.
There is no output yet.
There is also a  Debugger Console that says that the program hit a breakpoint on line 29 and has stopped there.
There is also a Breakpoints window that tells you that a breakpoint has been set on line number 29.
"""Before proceeding, let us see how to add a watch."""
"""For example, let us say, I want to watch on the integer value 'aSample'."""
"""In the 'Variables' window, below the workspace, I will double-click on  the Enter new Watch option and enter the name of the variable  """"aSample.value""""."""
Click on OK.
"""So far, aSample has not been created. So, it says it does not know the value."""
"""Once it executes the line, we'll know what the variable contains."""
"""In a similar way, you can also watch and evaluate expressions."""
"""Here, I'm checking for b=a+10."""
What if I wanted to know what a-4 is.
"""So, let me go to the Debug menu in the menu bar and select Evaluate expression option."""
The 'Evaluate Code' window appears in the workspace.
"""Here, I will enter the expression  a-4."""
"""Click on the Evaluate Expression button here and in the Variable window, it says (a-4)'s value is 6."""
Let us now proceed and execute this single line of code.
"""To do that, choose the Step-Over button from the toolbar."""
That should execute only that 1 single line  of the code to print  “Hello World”.
"""To see the output, go to the output window and choose the sampleDebug output window"""
"""that says, """"Hello World! 'a' is 10""""."""
The program has now stopped at the line to create a SampleClass object.
"""Now, I want to go into the constructor of the  SampleClass."""
"""To do that, I can choose the  Step Into option from the toolbar."""
Then I can choose the Step Over and see that the value came inside the constructor call is now set to 10.
You can also check that by hovering over the variable.
"""When I Step Over again, we can see that this.variable is also set to 10."""
"""To get out of this function, I can either choose Continue, Step Over or Step Out."""
Let me choose Step-Out to come out of the method.
"""And, now I'm back to where the function call was made."""
"""When I say Step-Over again, you will notice that aSample.value is now set to 10."""
This is what we were watching for.
"""Apart from Breakpoints and Step Overs, you can also stop the execution of the program at the line of the cursor."""
"""For example, let me go into the function here and set the cursor to be on this line which says d=b-5; ."""
"""Now, from the toolbar, choose the Run To Cursor option."""
You will notice that the execution of the program gets into the function and stops at the line where the cursor is located.
You can see that it has computed the value of b as 20.
"""And inside the Variable window, it has set b to be 20."""
"""Now, I can choose Step Over again and 'd's value also gets initialized and becomes 15."""
"""Now, I can either choose to return or completely finish the execution of the program."""
Let me choose Step Out and come back to the function call.
"""When you hover on the getC() function, you'll notice that the function has returned a value of 15."""
The variable 'c' has not yet been assigned that value.
"""So, when we Step Over and execute that line, c will get a value of 15."""
We can now check it in the Variable window or hover on the variable to check it's value.
"""Now, if you want to stop the debugging session, you can choose the Finish Debugger Session option from the toolbar."""
"""If you want to continue the execution to the next breakpoint, you can choose the Continue option."""
"""Once you finish, you can choose the Continue option to complete the execution of the remaining program."""
Let me choose Continue here.
"""In the Output window, it shows me the output as: b is 20 and c is 15."""
"""Now, this was a quick overview of the options of debugging on netbeans."""
"""If you want any advanced feature settings, you can"""
"""go to Tools menu, click on Options. Go to the Miscellaneous option, click on the Java Debugger tab."""
"""Here, you can change settings for multi-threaded program breakpoint options."""
"""Or, have filters to decide on which methods you would want to step in."""
"""Now, to the assignment.."""
"""As an assignment, take any of your programs, excellent if it has already errors."""
"""If not, introduce some errors with the logic or algorithm."""
"""Set breakpoints in the code. Usually, you would set a break at the calling point of a function which you suspect has the error."""
Use Step Into to go into the function.
Use Step Overs to execute the lines and make sure to inspect the values of variables in the Variable window.
Add some watches to help you identify and correct the error.
Step Out of the method.
Continue till you reach the next breakpoint.
"""And finally, finish the debugger session and run your application."""
"""In this tutorial, we became familiar with the Netbeans Debugger."""
We saw how to set breakpoints and watches.
Add expressions which we want to evaluate while the code is running.
"""Trace the execution of a program with Step-Into, Step-Over, Step-Out and Run-to-Cursor options."""
"""Also, saw how to configure the debugger for advanced debugging."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Static Methods.
"""In this tutorial we will learn:  what are static methods , defining static methods."""
difference between instance methods and static methods and  how to use static methods.
"""Here we are using  Ubuntu 14.04, JDK 1 .7 and  Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial,  you must have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
"""You should also have the knowledge of instance variables, methods and static variables in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
A static method is a method which is associated with the entire class.
It is also called a class method and is declared using the static keyword.
Static methods are usually used to handle static variables.
Now we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called StaticMethodDemo.
Inside this project we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Static methods.
We will create a new class StudentEnroll.
Let us see how to use static methods with an example.
The example is very similar to the one which is used in the Static Variable tutorial.
Here again we are representing the StudentEnroll class.
Recall that the variables name and id are handled as instance variables.
Here the variables organization and total count are common to the entire class.
So they can be treated as static variables.
Now type the following code to represent the StudentEnroll class.
Note that there are two static variables count and orgname.
Also note that orgname is not a static constant rather it is normal static variable.
The static variable orgname is initialized as “IIT Bombay”.
Now click on Source -> and select Generate Constructor using Fields.
Delete the super keyword from the generated code.
"""Inside the constructor, type count ++ semicolon  So, the count value is incremented every time an object is created."""
Now we will add a method showData( ) to this class to print the values of the variables.
So type public void showData( ).
"""Within brackets type the following code to print the values of id, name and organisation name."""
Now we will add the static method setOrgName.
Type the following code.
The setOrgName method represented here is a static method which can modify the value of orgname.
Any method which is used to handle static variables can be defined as a static method.
Now let us explore the differences between instance method and static method.
Instance methods can access static variables.
Whereas a static method can directly access and modify only static variables.
Instance methods are invoked only by an object.
Whereas a static method can be invoked directly without creating an object.
We cannot use ‘this’ and ‘super’ keyword inside a static method.
This is because these keywords refer to the instance of a particular class.
"""In a static context, we can’t refer to instances of a class."""
Let us see what happens if we try to access an instance variable directly inside this static method.
"""Type,  id= “newid” semicolon"""
Now an error comes up in Eclipse.
It indicates that an instance variable cannot be accessed directly inside a static method.
So let us comment this line and proceed.
Now we will add one more static method showOrgData.
These statements print the values of orgname and count.
"""Now right click on the default package, click New-> Class and then type the name as Demo."""
Inside this class we will have the main method.
So type main and then press Ctrl+space to generate the main method.
We will create a few objects of StudentEnroll class to represent student enrollments.
"""So type the following code to create 3 objects s1, s2 and s3."""
Now let us invoke the showData method to print the enrollment details.
"""Type the following code to invoke showData method on s1, s2 and s3."""
Let us also invoke the method showOrgData to print the values of orgname and count.
Since it is a static method we can invoke it directly using its class name.
"""To do so, type this code."""
Now let us run the Demo program.
"""We can see that the values of the variables corresponding to s1 i.e IT101, ADIL and IIT BOMBAY gets printed."""
Similarly the values corresponding to s2 and s3 are also printed.
"""Note that the value of orgname ie IIT BOMBAY is common for s1, s2 and s3."""
orgname and count are printed separately by the static method showOrgData.
Note that the organisation name is printed as IIT Bombay.
"""The value of the number of student enrollments is printed as 3, as we have already created 3 objects."""
A static method can be invoked directly by the class name itself.
Now let us invoke the static method setOrgName.
We will change the organisation name from “IIT Bombay” to “IIT Mumbai”.
So type the following code.
"""Now let us once again invoke the showData method on s1, s2 and s3 to print the enrollment details."""
For that type the following code again.
"""Once again, let us invoke the method showOrgData to print the values of orgname and count."""
"""To do so, type this code."""
Now run the Demo program again.
We can see that the organisation name is changed to “IIT Mumbai”.
Let us come back to slides.
Object references can be passed to a static method.
This way a static method can access the instance variables of that particular object.
Let us try it in our code.  Switch to Eclipse and go to the StudentEnroll class.
"""Now in the setOrgName method, pass another argument as an object of StudentEnroll class."""
"""So after String org, type  comma StudentEnroll s"""
"""Now inside this method, uncomment id = """"newid"""""""
"""And instead of id,type  s.id"""
Now go to the Demo class.
Let us modify the function call to setOrgName method by passing the StudentEnroll object s1.
"""So here, after “IIT Mumbai”, type comma s1."""
Now run the Demo program again.
We can see that the value of id for s1 has changed to “newid”.
Let us summarize.  In this tutorial we have learnt about
What is a static method and when it is used
How to differentiate static methods and instance methods and
How to create and invoke static methods
This assignment is a continuation of the Static variable assignment.
Make sure that you have completed the Static variable assignment.
We will highlight only the modifications here.
Here we have a variable to represent “status”.
It is used to indicate whether the car is “in” for service or “out” after service
We will also have another variable to represent  No of cars out after Service.
Define a method service( Car c) which updates the status to ”out”.
Accordingly it modifies the values for
No of Cars in for Service  No of Cars out after Service
Also define a method show( ) to print all the car details.
"""As before, we need to perform the following as listed."""
Note that we have to identify and define the static method as required.
Also create a Demo class.
"""Inside the main method, Create a few objects of CarService."""
Invoke the service( ) method on some of them.
Invoke the show( ) method using all the objects and verify the results.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Fill color and stroke using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Fill color in objects Give objects an outline Various types of gradients and  Stroke paint and style."""
"""For this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS Inkscape version 0.48.4"""
"""Let's open Inkscape. For this, go to Dash home and type: """"Inkscape""""."""
You can open Inkscape by clicking on the logo.
Let's open the 'Assignment.svg' file that we created earlier. I had saved it in my Documents folder.
These are the 3 shapes we created in an earlier assignment.
Recall that we had learnt to change color using the color palette at the bottom of the interface.
Now we will learn how to fill colors of various types using Fill and Stroke.
Let's go to Object menu and click on the Fill and Stroke option from the drop-down list.
Notice that the Fill and Stroke dialog box has opened on the right side of the interface.
"""There are 3 tabs in this dialog box: Fill, Stroke paint and Stroke style."""
"""Now, we will click on the rectangle in the canvas area. Observe that the options and icons in the Fill and stroke dialog box get enabled."""
"""First, we will learn about the Fill tab."""
Notice there are 6 icons under the Fill tab. Let us learn what these icons do.
The first icon is called No paint. It indicates that the object will not be filled with any color.
Click on the icon and notice the change in the rectangle. The color of the rectangle has been removed.
The next icon is Flat color. It helps to fill a solid color into an object.
Click on the Flat color icon and observe the change of colour in the rectangle shape.
"""Under Flat color, notice that there are 5 sub-tabs."""
"""By default, RGB tab is selected."""
"""Under 'RGB' tab, there are 4 sliders."""
"""The first 3 sliders indicate the intensity of Red, Green and Blue colours."""
We can change the color by moving these sliders in left or right directions. Observe the color change in the rectangle as I do so.
"""The fourth slider is the Alpha slider. With this, we can increase or decrease the opacity level of the colour, from opaque to fully transparent."""
"""As I move these 4 sliders, observe that the RGBA values of the color shown in these boxes change automatically."""
Let me move the sliders once again so that you can observe this change.
We can change the color manually by changing the values of each color in the boxes at the right of the sliders.
"""Let me change the value of Red to 100, Green to 50 and Blue to 150. Notice the color of the rectangle has now changed to violet."""
I keep the Alpha level as 255 since I do not want to reduce the opacity level.
"""The next tab is HSL and it stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness respectively."""
We can use the Hue slider to get a base color. I move the slider towards the left direction to get a base of green color.
We can adjust the saturation of the base colour using the Saturation slider.
Observe the change in the saturation level by moving the slider in left or right directions.
The Lightness slider adjusts the 'lightness' of the base color.
"""With this option, one can vary the shade of the base colour from pure white to pure black or any shade in-between."""
"""As before, the Alpha slider is used to increase or decrease the opacity level from opaque to fully transparent."""
"""The next tab is CMYK which denotes Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black respectively."""
"""By moving these sliders, we can increase or decrease the intensity or the depth of the base colour."""
This color mixing option is useful when design projects are to be printed on commercial presses.
Next is the Wheel tab. This is an alternative representation of the HSL color mixer.
We can select the base hue by clicking on the color ring that is based on the standard color wheel.
"""So, I will click on yellow shade to select a base of yellow color."""
"""Within the color circle, there is a triangle with a small circle inside it. Just click on it and drag it inside the triangle and observe the color change in the rectangle."""
The CMS tab will only be of real interest to those working in color managed environments.
"""For now, we will skip this tab."""
"""Next, let us learn how to create a Linear gradient."""
Go to canvas and click on the circle.
"""Now, come back to the Fill and Stroke dialog box and click on the Linear gradient icon."""
Observe the gradient fill in the circle.
The gradient will be given a name ending with a series of random numbers.
"""In my interface, the number is linearGradient3794. In yours, it may be different."""
We can change the gradient by clicking the Edit button which is right below the linear gradient number button.
This will open the Gradient editor dialog box.
The top button in this box is named stop followed by some random numbers and it contains a drop-down menu.
"""If you click the arrows on this drop down, you will see two stop options."""
"""The first one denotes the pure base colour. The other one is half checker board, indicating that it's transparent."""
"""Select the second option, that is, the transparent stop option."""
Go to the Stop Color below. Change the RGB values to whichever color you like by moving the sliders.
Keep Alpha value at 255 to make the gradient fully visible. Close the Gradient editor dialog box.
"""Now, we can change the gradient angle. To do so, click on Node tool from the tool box, on the left of the interface. This is located right below the Selector tool."""
This will display a line on the circle. This line represents the gradient.
These currently overlap with the square handle and the arc handles of the circle.
"""We will have to move the gradient line handles a little bit, so that we can see the handles clearly."""
Click and drag the circular handle or the square handle to change the position where the gradient starts and ends.
"""We can also rotate the direction of the gradient by moving the circular handle, as demonstrated."""
"""Now, we will learn how to use Radial gradient. Click on the icon and observe the gradient change in the circle."""
The Radial gradient is formed in a circular shape.
Notice 1 square handle and 2 circular handles.
Click on the middle square handle to move the gradient's starting point. I will move it to the bottom left.
Click and drag on any one of the circular handles to make changes in the gradient.
Observe the change in the height and width of the gradient shape.
We can find the Gradient tool in the Tool box also.
Let's click on it and come back to our circle.
Notice that the cursor has now changed into a plus sign with capital I.
"""Now, click anywhere inside the circle and drag. Notice the change in the gradient."""
"""Now, click anywhere outside the circle and drag."""
Notice the change in the gradient.
"""Next, we will learn how to overlay various patterns on shapes."""
"""Go to Tool box, click on the Selector tool and then click on the star shape."""
"""In the Fill and stroke dialog box, click on the Pattern icon. Notice the color of the star has changed to a stripe pattern."""
There is a drop-down menu under Pattern fill. Click on the arrows to see the available patterns.
Let's click on Checkerboard and observe the change in the star shape.  You can use any of these available patterns shown here.
We will learn about Swatch in another tutorial.
"""The last icon called Unset paint, is used to unset the color of the selected object to black."""
Click on the icon and observe the color change in the star. It has changed to black.
"""Now, let us learn how to give stroke or an outline to an object. To do this, we have to use the Stroke paint tab."""
"""Now, click on Stroke paint tab and click on the rectangle."""
The icons under the Stroke paint tab are the same as the Fill tab.
They function in the same manner as well.
"""With the first icon, that is No paint, we remove the outline of the shape."""
"""Next, we will click on Flat color icon. We see a black color outline around the rectangle shape."""
We can increase or decrease the thickness of the outline using the Stroke style tab.
"""Let's keep the width parameter as 10. We can also change the units into percentage, point etc. depending on our requirement."""
I will keep the unit as Pixels.
Let's go back again to the Stroke paint tab. We can change the color of the stroke by moving the sliders under the RGB tab.
"""Observe the color change in the outline, as I do so."""
"""Explore the other Flat color options such as HSL, CMYK, Wheel and CMS on your own."""
"""Now, let me click on the Linear gradient. This gives a gradient outline to the rectangle shape."""
"""The gradients that we used earlier, will appear in the drop-down list here. We can use any of those too."""
Let me give red and blue gradient outline to my rectangle.
"""In a similar way, we can use the remaining stroke icons and give some interesting patterns and gradient outlines to our objects."""
Next we will learn about Stroke style. Click on it.
We already learnt how to modify the width of the stroke.
"""Now, let's look at the 3 Join icons namely, Miter join, Round join and Bevel join. By default, the stroke is in Miter join."""
Let me zoom in to one of the corners of the rectangle for a better view.
"""Now, let's click on the Round join to give a round corner to the stroke. Observe the changes in the edges of the stroke."""
"""Next, we will click on the Bevel join option to create a Bevel corner."""
"""Various dash patterns are available in the Dashes drop-down menu. Using these, we can give different dash patterns to the stroke and vary the width too."""
Next is the Cap option. This basically works on line strokes.
"""Go to Tool box. Click on Freehand tool. So, let us draw a line with the help of Freehand tool."""
"""Now, let us zoom in to the end of the line."""
"""By default, Butt cap is selected and it gives a flat edge to the end."""
"""Now, I will click on the Round cap to give a rounded edge."""
Next is the Square cap which gives a flat and extended edge to the ends of the line.
There are 3 Markers right below the Dashes tab which places markers on the middle of the path.
Click on the drop-down menu of each Marker to see the available lists.
"""Under Start Markers, let me select Torso."""
We will select Curvein as Mid markers.
"""For the End Markers, we will select Legs."""
Observe a cartoon shape is formed on the canvas.
"""Lastly, notice 2 sliders at the bottom of the Fill and stroke dialog box,  namely, Blur and Opacity."""
Let's first select the rectangle again.
The Blur slider is used to give a blur effect to an object. I will click on the slider and move it towards the right.
Observe that the rectangle becomes blurred as I move the slider more and more to the right.
The Opacity slider is used to give transparency to a shape. Move the slider to the right and observe the changes in the shape.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt to:"""
Fill color in objects using the Fill and Stroke options Give strokes or outlines to shapes Various types of Gradients and  Stroke Paint and Stroke Styles.
Here is an assignment for you-
1. Create a pentagon filled with a Linear gradient of red and yellow color with a blue stroke of width 5 pixels.
2. An ellipse filled with Wavy pattern and change the opacity to 70%.
"""3. A line with a width of 10, with Start Markers as Arrow1Lstart and End Markers as Tail."""

"""Dear Friends, Welcome to the spoken tutorial on “LaTeX on Windows using TeXworks”"""
"""In this tutorial we will learn to,  Download and install MikTeX ."""
Write basic LaTeX documents using TeXworks.
Configure MikTeX to download missing packages.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Windows7 operating system and MikTeX2.9"""
Let us now see the salient features of TeXworks
It is platform independent
It has an embedded pdf reader
It supports Indian language typesetting
"""Before we start with TeXworks, we have to install MikTeX."""
MikTeX is an up-to-date implementation of TeX/LaTeX and related programs for Windows.
"""It contains the necessary packages to create basic documents in LaTeX on Windows ,Moreover, TeXworks is a default editor available with MikTeX installation."""
Go to the website www.miktex.org
Click on the download link for recommended MikTeX installer. This will download the MikTeX installer.
Download and save it on your Desktop..
"""It is a large file, about 154 mega bytes. Hence, it will take some time to download."""
I have already downloaded this file. Here it is.
Double click on this file to start the installation.
Check the check box and click on Next.
Choose all default options.
The installation will take around 5 to 10 minutes.
I have already installed MikTeX on my computer. Hence I will not proceed with the installation.
"""After successfully installing MikTeX on your computer,"""
let us see how to use the TeXworks editor which comes with MikTeX.
Click on the Windows start button.
Click on All Programs.
Click on MikTeX2.9.
Click on TeXworks.
TeXworks editor will open.
Let me open an already existing LaTeX document.
"""I will click on File, then click on Open and choose the directory. Then I will open the file hello.tex."""
You can see that the text written in the file is colored.
This is called syntax highlighting.  It helps the user differentiate between the user content and the LaTeX syntax.
"""In case the LaTeX syntax is not highlighted, do the following."""
"""In the TeXworks window, click on Format button available on the Menu bar."""
Select Syntax Colouring and then click on LaTeX.
"""If you want TeXworks to apply syntax highlighting every time you create a LaTeX document, do the following"""
"""On the menu bar, click on Edit and then click on Preferences."""
"""In the Editor tab, click on the dropdown button which gives options for Syntax Colouring."""
Choose LaTeX and then click on Ok.
"""In this way, syntax highlighting will be applied to all documents created in the future."""
Now we are ready to compile our LaTeX document.
Press Ctrl and t keys together to start the compilation.
"""Once the document is compiled without errors, the resulting pdf will be opened."""
Note that this pdf reader comes along with TeXworks.
It is the default pdf reader used by TeXworks to display the compiled pdf documents.
We have completed the basic installation of LATEX.
This is sufficient for many formatting requirements.
You may now leave this tutorial. Practice the remaining LATEX tutorials on the playlist
"""While practising other tutorials, you may get the following error message:“The required file ABC is missing. It is a part of the following package: XYZ”"""
Here ABC is a file inside the package XYZ
ABC and XYZ will be specific to your case.
"""When you get such an error message, listen to the rest of this tutorial."""
Two ways to solve that problem are explained in the rest of this tutorial. At least one of them should work for you.
Goodbye for now
Do you want to know how to solve a problem of the following type: Listen to the rest of this tutorial and practise with me.
Now let us compile a Beamer document.
Beamer package by default is not included in the MikTeX setup that we have installed.
This means that we have to : download it from some source and add it to our current MikTeX distribution
There are two ways of installing a missing package.
One way is to install it on the fly while we are compiling a LaTeX document
This LaTeX document will typically require a package not available in your MikTeX distribution.
"""Other way, is to manually choose and install a package using Package Manager of MikTeX."""
Let us see the first method.
"""We will  open and compile a LaTeX document, which requires MikTeX  to install packages from the internet."""
First close the TeXworks editor.
It is required that we open the tex file with administrator privileges.
Click on the start button. Then click on All programs. Click on MikTeX2.9
Right click on TeXworks and choose Run as Administrator
This will launch the TeXworks editor with administrator privileges.
Now click on File. Then click on Open  Choose the file beamer.tex
Press Ctrl and t keys together to start the compilation.
A Package Installation dialog box will open.
It will ask to install the missing package beamer.cls.
Click on Change button on this dialog box.
Change Package Repository dialog box will open.
Choose the option Packages shall be installed from the internet.
Click on Connection Settings.
It will prompt you to configure the proxy settings.
If you are not on a proxy network then leave the Use proxy server checkbox unchecked.
"""Since i am on a proxy network, i will enable the option by clicking on the checkbox"""
I will enter the proxy address.
I will enter proxy port number.
I will enable the option Authentication required by clicking on the corresponding checkbox
Click on Ok. And then click on Next
It will ask me the proxy username and password.
I will enter the information and click on OK.
It will show a list of various remote package repositories.
Choose one from the list and click on Finish.
Click on Install.
It will install the beamer.cls package
Once again the Package Installation dialog box will open.
It will prompt to install the missing package pgfcore.sty.
You may uncheck the option Always show this dialog before installing packages.
"""If you do this, MikTeX will not prompt you again, if it encounters a missing package."""
Click on Install.
"""Now if there any more missing packages, it will automatically install it, without asking for your permission."""
"""Once the installation completes, it will finish the compilation and open the pdf output."""
We can see that we have successfully compiled a Beamer document.
Now let us see the second method of installing missing packages.
Click on the Windows start button.
Click on All Programs.
Click on MikTeX2.9
Click on Maintenance (Admin)
Cick on Package Manager (Admin)
It will show a list of various packages available.
Now let us take a look at this list.
There are six columns in this list.
"""These are Name, Category, Size, Packaged date, Installed on date and Title."""
The Installed on column is very important to us.
The packages for which this column is blank indicates that these packages are not installed.
Let us see how to install a particular package.
"""Let me choose the package abc, for example."""
"""Notice that the moment I choose the package, the plus button on the top left side gets enabled."""
The plus button is the install button. Click on the plus button.
A window will open which will list the number of packages you have chosen to install or uninstall.
Click on Proceed.
"""Since I have configured a proxy network connection, it will prompt me for the proxy username and password."""
Let me type my username and password
Click on Ok
A window will open which will show the download progress of the package selected for installation.
It may happen that it fails to download the requested package due to remote server connectivity issues.
"""In that case, change the package repository and try again."""
We can see that the installation of selected package is completed.
Click on Close.
The package list will get refreshed.
Notice that 11 september 2013 appears in the Installed on column for package abc.
This completes the tutorial LaTeX on Windows using TeXworks

"""Welcome to Meet the GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I’m recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""In the previous edition I got this image here, after editing."""
"""And today, I think I should do something to set the colors"""
because this image is too green.
There are lot of ways to adjust the color and one of them is the Curves tool.
I click on the Curves tool in tool box and then I select the Green Channel and pull the curve down.
Now you can see that the colour channels and the fog in the image looks like the real fog.
"""Now, I have to adjust the curve in such a way that I get an image which is gray and not green or magenta."""
I don’t want to use Curves tool because it damages the details of the image and I can’t correct the damage afterwards.
I could use the Undo tool but I will have to redo all the steps after that.
"""So, I want to have something that will not damage the image and I can adjust later on."""
There is such a way which uses a simple filter with layers.
"""So, I have opened here the layer dialog."""
You will see here background which is our original image.
"""And I simply add a new layer and I select White in Layer Fill Type and give it a name, color correction green."""
Now my image is fully white but I can change the layer mode.
The 'layer mode' is an algorithm which combines the two layers i.e the original Background layer and the newly created layer.
"""So, I choose here the Multiply mode."""
"""And you get the original image back, as it was before."""
"""The Multiply mode, multiplies the pixels from the background to the pixels from the foreground and divides the result by 255."""
"""And in a white picture, all the color channels are 255; so multiplying by 255 and dividing by 255 gives the starting point i.e. Background."""
"""But if I reduce one channel in the new layer, it will be reduced in the background also because multiplying by say 200 and dividing by 255 gives less."""
Now I want to select such a color which has a reduced green channel.
"""Here I have black as foreground colour which I change to background colour and white as foreground colour and you can see that red, green & blue all colour channels have same value i.e 255."""
"""By the way, don’t be distracted by the colours on the slider here."""
"""This is not blue, this is yellow but when I slide this down to a certain point, you see that colours in all the sliders change automatically."""
"""Ok, I select the green slider here and pull the slider to say something around 211."""
And I pull the colour which I got as my foreground colour into my image and I get the result which is way to magenta.
But I can adjust the intensity of my green reduction with the help of the opacity slider.
"""And when I go back to zero, I get the old image and when I pull the slider up I can reduce the green channel in the image and also avoid getting magenta into the image."""
I think this looks quite good.
"""By using the Layers tool, I can do changes anytime I want to and also I can do fine adjustments when more layers are stacked onto it and the change will stay even if I change something in underlying picture."
There are still changes to be made in this layer as now it appears gray and I want to add a bit of blue.
Again I follow the same procedure and make a new layer and called it color correction blue.
And now I want to add a little bit of blue.
"""For adding blue in the image, I use the Screen Mode which is  little bit more complicated than Multiply mode."""
"""In Screen mode, the colors are first inverted and then multiplied and divided and quite complicated."""
Let me change the foreground colour to black and add the colour  I want to add directly and now I have to add a little bit of blue.
"""So, slide down the blue slider a bit."""
And drag the colour into the image.
"""This, here, is supposed to be blue which looks still like black but it is very dark blue."""
"""Look at the image here and when I switch this off, you see the change."""
The image is definitely bluish.
I can switch off both the new layers and by that you get the starting point.
"""When I click on the first layer, we see the reduced channel of green and when I click on 2nd layer it adds a bit blue colour."""
I think this is too much blue so I reduce the opacity.
I think this looks good.
"""I can adjust it later on, all the time."""
The Layers tool is very powerful because you can create layer upon layers and in each layer you can change the pixels which are coming up from the lower layer.
Possibilities of doing the correction is limitless and you can do it whenever you want.
Perhaps here you can slide the opacity slider a bit down to get a good colour and you can play with these sliders which give real hand full of possibilities to change the color here.
I think I have to cover the Layers tool in detail on a special show but for today this is enough.
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project and I hope to see you around next time."""
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on BOSS Desktop.
"""In this tutorial, we will get familiar with the BOSS Desktop environment."""
"""Here, I am using BOSS Linux 3.4.2 with wide Indian language support & packages."""
Let me minimize the slide.
"""What you are seeing here, is the BOSS Desktop."""
You can see the main menu on the top left hand side corner.
"""To open this menu, press Alt+F1 keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""Alternately, click on Applications menu."""
The 'Applications menu' contains all the installed applications in a categorized manner.
"""In this Applications menu, let us get familiar with some important applications."""
"""So, let's go to Applications, Accessories, Calculator."""
"""Calculator helps perform arithmetic, scientific or financial calculations."""
Let's open the calculator by clicking on it.
Let us try some simple calculations.
Type 5*(into)8 and press '='(equals to) sign.
"""Instead of pressing '='(equals to) sign, you can also press the Enter key."""
"""Now, exit this calculator by pressing the close button."""
"""Now, let's look at another application."""
"""For that, go back to Applications, then go to Accessories."""
"""In Accessories, let's open gedit Text Editor by clicking on it."""
"""So, what you see right now on screen is the gedit Text Editor."""
Let me type some text here and save it.
Type: Hello World.
"""To save the file, I can press Crtl+S keys or go to File and then click on Save."""
"""So, let me go to File and then click on Save."""
The Save As dialog box opens up.
It prompts for filename and location in which the file has to be saved.
"""So, let me type the name as hello.txt and for location, I will select the Desktop."""
Click on Save button.
Let's close this gedit window now and check whether our file is saved on the Desktop or not.
"""Now come to the Desktop and you can see the file """"hello.txt"""" here."""
"""So, our text file has got saved successfully."""
Let me open this file by double-clicking on it.
"""Here is our text, """"Hello World""""."""
"""We can type in multiple local languages too, in the 'gedit Text Editor'."""
Let us see how to do so.
"""In gedit Text Editor, press CTRL + SPACE BAR."""
You can see a small box at the bottom right hand side.
Click on it.
Select 'Hindi'.
Inscript.
I will type hello world.
You can see the text has changed to Hindi Inscript.
"""Now I will select Hindi,  then I will select Phonetic."""
I will type welcome using phonetics.
And you can see the word welcome typed in Hindi.
"""Now, click on Save to save the changes."""
Let's close this text editor and let's see another important application from Accessories i.e Terminal.
"""So, let's move back to Applications, Accessories and then Terminal."""
"""Terminal is called command line because you can command the computer from here.In fact, it is more powerful than the GUI."""
Now let's type a simple command to get a feel of  Terminal.
"""So, let's type """"ls"""" and press Enter."""
You can see it lists all the files and folders in the current working directory.
Here it is displaying files and folders from the Home folder.
We will see later in this tutorial what the Home folder is.
Terminal commands are explained well in the subsequent Linux spoken tutorials in this series.
Let us close the Terminal now.
Now let's move on to another application i.e Iceweasel Web Browser.
This is the default web-browser on the BOSS Operating System.
Click on Applications >> Internet >> Iceweasel Web Browser.
Iceweasel is the re-branded version of Firefox.
"""Using this browser, you can access your emails or search for some information on the net."""
Let's go to the google-site.
"The short-cut key to go to the address bar is F6 or you can click here, on the address bar."""
I will type www.google.co.in.
"""As I type, Iceweasel may suggest a few possibilities."""
You may choose one of these or continue to type the complete address and press Enter.
We are now in the google search page.  Let us type spoken tutorial in the search bar.
The spoken tutorial website is listed as the first option.  Let's click on it.
This will open the spoken tutorial Home page.
Let's close this and move on.
"""Now, let's click on Applications and then on Office."""
"""In this Office menu, we have LibreOffice options like Writer, Calc and Impress."""
"""These are the word processor, spreadsheet and presentation components of LibreOffice Suite."""
The Spoken Tutorial website has spoken tutorials on these topics.  We suggest that you explore them.
"""Next, under Applications, let's explore Sound &Video menu."""
This option lists the various player options available in BOSS OS.
You can use any of these options to play your video or audio files.
"""Now, let's see some other important things. Let's go to Places menu this time."""
The first option here is the 'Home' folder.
Let's open it.
Every user has a unique Home folder in BOSS OS.
We can say that the Home folder is our house where we can store our files and folders.
"""Unless we permit, others cannot see them."""
"""More information on file permissions is available in the 'Linux spoken tutorials', available on the spoken tutorial website."""
"""In our Home folder, we can see other folders such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music etc."""
"""In Linux, everything is a file."""
Let's open the Desktop folder by double-clicking on it.
"""Hey, we can see that the same hello.txt file what we saved from gedit text editor is here."""
"""So, this folder and the Desktop are the same."""
Let me close this folder now.
Let's learn to change the Desktop theme now.
Go to the right hand side corner and click on the username displayed there.
"""In my case, the username is spoken.  So, I will click on spoken."""
"""Now, click on System Settings option."""
The System Settings dialog box opens up.
Click on Background icon.
Choose any background from the list displayed.
It will appear as your new background.
Close this dialog box.
"""Now, we will come to the System Tools option available under 'Applications' menu."""
This menu has many important options which helps you to manage your desktop and the various applications.
Click on System tools >> Administration and Synaptic Package Manager.
It will immediately prompt you for the 'admin password' for authentication.
Type in your 'admin' password and click on Authenticate button.

Hello everyone.
Welcome to the tutorial on  'Connecting to a MySQL Database'.
"""In this tutorial, we will look at:"""
Configuring MySQL server properties
Starting the MySQL server
Creating and connecting to the database
Creating database tables under which we will explore two methods:
using the sql editor
"""using the create table dialog and finally,"""
Running an SQL script.
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System Ubuntu version 12.04"""
and  Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
You also need the  Java Development Kit (JDK) version 6
and  MySQL database server.
"""To learn this tutorial, basic understanding of database management is necessary."""
"""To know more, watch  PHP and MySQL spoken tutorials on the link shown."""
Other standard programming terminologies have been used in this tutorial.
This tutorial demonstrates how to setup a connection to a MySQL database from the Netbeans IDE.
"""Once connected, we will work with MySQL in the IDE's Database  Explorer."""
Let us switch to the IDE now.
Netbeans IDE comes bundled with support for the MySQL RDBMS.
"""Before you access  MySQL database server in Netbeans, you must configure the MySQL server properties."""
Right-click the Databases node in the Services window.
Choose  Register MySQL Server to open the MySQL server properties dialog-box.
Confirm that the Server Host Name and the Port are correct.
"""Notice that the IDE enters """"localhost"""" as the default server host name."""
3306 is the default server port Number.
"""Enter the Administrator Username, if not displayed."""
"""On my system, the Administrator Username is """"root""""."""
Enter the Administrator password.
"""On my system, the password is blank."""
Click the  Admin Properties tab at the top of the dialog-box.
This allows you to enter information for controlling the MySQL server.
"""In the  Path/URL to admin tool: field,"""
type or browse to the location of your  'MySQL Administration' application.
"""On my system, the location to the tool is  /usr/bin/mysqladmin."""
Type any arguments for the admin tool in the Arguments field.
This can also be left blank.
"""In the Path to start command: field,"""
type or browse to the location of the  MySQL start command.
On my system it is: /usr/bin/mysqld_safe.
Type any arguments for the start command in the Arguments field.
"""Here, I will type:  -u space root space  start."""
"""In the Path to stop command:,"""
type or browse to the location of the MySQL stop command.
This is usually the path to the mysqladmin' in the bin folder of the MySQL installation directory.
"""On my system, this is: /usr/bin/mysqladmin."""
"""If the command is mysqladmin, in the Arguments field, type: -u space root space stop."""
"""When finished, the Admin Properties tab should resemble what is shown on the screen."""
Click OK.
First ensure that the MySQL database server is running on your machine.
"""The MySQL server node in the Service window, indicates whether the MySQL database server is connected."""
"""After making sure that it is running, right-click the Databases >> MySQL server node and choose Connect."""
"""When expanded, the MySQL server node displays all the available MySQL databases."""
A common way of interacting with databases is through an SQL Editor.
Netbeans has a built-in SQL Editor for this purpose.
You can access this by right-clicking on the connection node.
Let us now create a new database instance using the SQL Editor.
"""In the Services window, right-click the MySQL server node and choose Create Database."""
"""In the Create Database dialog, type the name of the new database."""
"""I will name this """"mynewdatabase""""."""
You can also grant full access to a given user.
"""By default, only the admin user has the permissions to perform certain commands."""
The drop-down list allows you to assign these permissions to a specified user.
"""It is a good practice to grant users most permissions, except to drop tables"""
and allow users to modify only those databases that are created by their application.
"""But for now, we will leave the check-box unselected."""
"""Let us now create tables, populate them with data and modify the data maintained in tables."""
"""""""mynewdatabase"""" is currently empty."""
Let us explore the first method to input data in the tables.
"""In the Database explorer, expand the mynewdatabase connection node."""
There are three sub folders:
"""Tables, Views  and Procedures."""
Right-click the Tables folder and choose Execute Command.
"""A blank canvas opens in the  SQL Editor, in the main window."""
Let us type a simple query in this  SQL editor.
I have now typed a simple query in the SQL editor.
"""This is a table definition for the  Counselor table, we are about to create."""
"""To execute this query, either right-click the Run SQL icon in the task bar at the top"""
or right-click within the SQL Editor and choose Run Statement.
The IDE generates the Counselor table in the database.
You can see this message in the Output window
which says that the command was executed successfully.
"""To verify these changes, right-click the Tables node in the Database Explorer."""
Choose Refresh.
This updates the current status of the specified database.
The new Counselor table now displays under the Tables option.
"""If you expand the Table node, you can see the columns that you created."""
"""Let us now explore the next method to input data in the tables,"""
i.e. using the Create Table Dialog.
"""In the Database Explorer, right-click the Tables node and choose Create Table."""
The Create Table dialog opens.
"""In the Table name text field, type """"Subject""""."""
Click on Add Column .
"""In the Add Column dialog, type """"id"""" in the Name field."""
Choose SMALLINT for data-type from the Type drop-down menu.
Select the Primary Key check-box in the Add Column dialog-box.
This is to specify the primary-key for your table.
"""Note that when you select the Primary Key check-box, the Index and Unique check-boxes are automatically selected;"""
also the Null check-box is deselected.
This is because primary-keys are used to identify an unique row in the database.
Click OK.
"""Repeat this procedure to add the remaining columns, as shown on the screen."""
"""We have now created a table named Subject that will hold data for Name, Description and Counselor ID."""
"""By running SQL queries on a database, we can add, modify and delete data maintained in database structures."""
Let us add a new record to the Counselor table.
Choose Execute Command from the Tables node context menu.
A new SQL Editor opens in the main window.
"""In the SQL Editor, let us type a simple query."""
"""To execute this query, right-click within the source editor and choose Run Statement."""
Let us now verify if the new record has been added to the table.
Right-click the Counselor table and choose View Data.
A query to select all data from the table is automatically generated.
The results of this statement are displayed in a table view below the workspace.
Note that a new row has been added with the data we just supplied.
We can also run an external SQL script directly in the IDE.
I have a SQL query here for demonstrative purposes.
This script creates two tables similar to the ones we have just created.
i.e. Counselor and Subject.
"""Because the script overwrites these tables,"""
we will delete these two tables if they already exist.
"""To delete tables, right-click on the Counselor table"""
and choose Delete.
Click Yes in the Confirm Object Deletion dialog-box.
Repeat the same for the Subject table.
"""Now, open the existing SQL query file from your system."""
"""From the File menu, choose Open File."""
Browse to the location containing this file.
The script automatically opens in the SQL editor.
Make sure the connection to mynewdatabase is selected.
"""Check this from the C onnection drop-down in the toolbar, at the top of the editor."""
Click the Run SQL  button in the task bar.
And the script is executed against the selected database.
Right-click the mynewdatabase connection node and choose Refresh.
This updates the database component to the current status of the specified database.
Right-click on any of these tables now and choose View Data.
"""And, below the workspace, you can see the data contained in the new tables."""
"""In this tutorial, you learnt to-"""
configure MySQL on your computer
set up a connection to the database server from the IDE
"""create, delete, modify data and"""
run SQL queries.
"""As an assignment,create another database instance with tables."""
Populate these tables with necessary data to maintain your personal book library.
"""And, run these SQL statements to view data."""
I have created a similar database which maintains details of my personal movie library.
Your assignment should resemble this.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installing Moodle on Local Server.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to download Moodle and install Moodle."""
"""To install Moodle, you should have a system supporting: Apache 2.x (or higher version),"""
MariaDB 5.5.30 (or any higher version) and  PHP 5.4.4 +(or any higher version).
"""To record this tutorial, I will be using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04,"""
"""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30"""
Moodle 3.3 and Firefox web browser.
You can use any web browser of your choice.
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
Please ensure that you have internet connectivity before you begin.
"""Also refer to the previous tutorials in this series. And, ensure that the prerequisites are met and the database is setup properly."""
We should have XAMPP running and We should have a database set up with username moodle-st.
"""First, let me go to the web browser and launch XAMPP."""
"""In the address bar, type: http colon double slash 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1  and press Enter."""
"""In the menu at the top right of the screen, click on PHPinfo."""
"""Now, press Ctrl + F keys and search for DOCUMENT underscore ROOT."""
It will be found in the table Apache Environment.
The value of DOCUMENT underscore ROOT will be either  slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs or slash var slash www
"""In my machine, it is slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs."""
Please make a note of this path. We are going to install Moodle here.
Let’s now start downloading Moodle. Go to the official website of Moodle which is moodle.org.
"""Click on the Downloads link in the top menu. And then, click on the latest release button MOODLE 3.3+."""
"""At the time of recording this tutorial, the latest stable Moodle version is 3.3. It could be different when you try."""
Click on the Download zip button. This will start downloading Moodle on our machine.
I have already downloaded this file and it is in my Downloads folder. So I will skip this step.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T keys together.
"""On the terminal, I will change the directory to Downloads."""
"""To do that, type the command: cd space Downloads and press Enter."""
You will have to type the path where you downloaded Moodle on your system.
"""Once you are in that directory, type ls and press Enter to list the files therein."""
Here is my Moodle installation file.  It has the name moodle hyphen latest hyphen 33 dot zip.
"""If you had renamed it to some other name during download, then locate that file in your folder."""
"""Next, we have to extract the contents of this zip file into the moodle folder."""
"""At the command prompt, type: sudo space unzip space moodle hyphen latest hyphen 33 dot zip space hyphen d space slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs slash. Now press Enter."""
Let’s clear the terminal by pressing Ctrl + L.
Now type: cd space slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs and press Enter.
"""To list the files in this directory, type ls and press Enter."""
You can see that a new folder named moodle has been created.
"""Let us give read, write and execute permissions to the owner and the group members of moodle folder."""
"""So, type: sudo space chmod space 777 space moodle slash and press Enter."""
"""Enter the administrative password, if prompted, and press Enter."""
Now switch to the browser and type: http colon double slash 127.0.0.1 slash moodle  or http colon double slash localhost slash moodle.
I have typed my localhost IP here.
This IP necessarily has to be the IP of the machine on which moodle is installed. Please note that moodle is the folder into which we had extracted earlier.
Press Enter and you will see the Moodle installation page.
"""By default, we are in step number one, that is, Configuration. Please note: Moodle can be installed in multiple languages."""
"""But we will limit ourselves to English language only. So, select English here. Click on Next button below the Language dropdown."""
"""Next is the Paths page. This is where the Web address, Moodle directory and Data directory are defined."""
Web address is the URL for us to access Moodle once installed.
This is the same URL that we entered above which is shown here.
Moodle directory is the folder where all the Moodle code is available.
"""Notice here, both Web address and Moodle directory are non-editable fields. These cannot be changed by us."""
Next is the Data directory. This is the folder where all file content uploaded by teachers and students will be stored.
"""This folder needs to have read and write permission. So, the files can be stored here."""
"""However, it should not be directly accessible on the web for security reasons."""
"""So, it is to be kept outside of the installation folder."""
moodledata inside the folder lampp is the default data directory which the installer tries to create.
"""However, it does not have the permission to create a folder here. So, we have to create this folder manually and give it the required permissions."""
"""Go to the terminal window. At the prompt, type: sudo space mkdir space slash opt slash lampp slash moodledata and press Enter."""
"""Now, type: sudo space chmod space 777 space slash opt slash lampp slash moodledata and press Enter."""
Go back to the browser now and click on Next button.
After this comes the database configuration page. Select MariaDB from the dropdown and click on the Next button.
Enter localhost as the  Database Host Name.
"""Now, we have to enter the database name, username and password. These are the ones we created earlier in phpMyAdmin."""
I will enter moodle-st as the database name.
Then moodle-st as the database username.
"""And, moodle-st as my database password."""
Leave the Table Prefix and the other fields as they are and click on Next.
We can see a terms and conditions page.
This is the step where you need to read the license agreement and agree to the same. Read the text and then click on Continue.
We can see the Server Checks page next. Scroll down to see the message Your server environment meets all minimum requirements.
You may get other errors as shown: Refer to the Additional reading material link of this tutorial for the solution.
Click on Continue.
"""This step may take some time depending on your internet speed. You may get an error message Site is being upgraded, please retry later if you refresh the page."""
"""In that case, please refresh after some time."""
Click Continue when you get a success message for the installation.
The next page is for administrator configuration.
Enter the username that you want for the Moodle Administrative page. I will enter the username as admin.
Now enter a password for the Moodle Administrator. The password here must follow these rules as shown here.
"""To enter the password, click on Click to enter text link."""
I will enter Spokentutorial1@ as my admin password. Click on Unmask icon to reveal the password.
Note down the username and password that you have created for future use.
Email address is a mandatory field. I will enter priyankaspokentutorial@gmail.com here.
"""In Select a country drop-down, select India. Select the timezone as Asia/Kolkata."""
We will leave rest of the fields with their default values.
Scroll down and click on Update Profile button.
Please note that Moodle is a resource consuming software. Every step may take time to complete.
Please wait for the next page to load and do not close or refresh the page.
The next screen is for Front page settings. This is the page people will see when they visit our moodle site.
Enter Digital India LMS as the Full Site Name.
Enter Digital India LMS again as the Short name for site.  This is what will be visible as the name of the moodle site in the navigation bar.
"""Let us leave the Front Page Summary as blank, for now. Select the timezone as Asia/Kolkata."""
"""The next dropdown is Self Registration. If Self Registration is enabled, then new users can register themselves on their own."""
Select Disable from the dropdown. Next is the text box no-reply address.
"""The default value in this field is noreply@localhost.  Since this is not a valid email ID, change it to noreply@localhost.com."""
"""This email ID will be shown as From address, when Moodle does not have any email ID to show."""
"""For example. If I specify to keep my address as private, all mails sent on my behalf will have this email ID.  Lastly, click on Save Changes button."""
We are now ready to use Moodle.  You can see the front page of the new site here.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial.  Let us summarize."""

"""This will help reduce the clutter. With less clutter, we can use these discussion as instructional material"""
"""Spoken Tutorial Project is funded by NMEICT, MHRD, Government of India. More information on this mission is available at the link shown."""
Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on Ubuntu Linux Desktop 16.04.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about  Ubuntu Linux Desktop  on the gnome environment"""
and some common applications on the Ubuntu Desktop.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 O S."""
The Ubuntu desktop looks like this.
You'll see the launcher on the left hand side of the screen.
How can we hide the launcher?
"""To do so, go to the launcher on the left side. Click on the System Settings icon."""
"""In the System Settings window, click on Appearance."""
"""In the Appearance window, click on the Behavior tab."""
"""Here, switch Auto-hide the Launcher to ON position."""
Now the launcher will be hidden.
"""If the launcher is hidden, as shown here, then we can make it visible again."""
"""To do so, move the cursor to the extreme left of the screen."""
The launcher will become visible.
Move the cursor away and the launcher will get hidden again.
Switch back to the Appearance window and turn Auto-hide the Launcher to OFF position.
Close this window by clicking on the tiny X icon at the top left of the window.
"""Notice, there are some icons on the launcher, by default."""
"""At the top of the launcher, you can see the Dash home icon."""
"""Dash home is an interface which gives access to all  applications in  Ubuntu Linux,   within a screen."""
"""To open Dash home, click on it."""
"""Prominently at the top, you'll see the search bar  field."""
"""Now, how do we locate a particular application? Just type in the name of the application you are looking for and you will find it instantly. It's that simple!"""
Let’s try to locate the Calculator application.
"""So, in the search bar field, type C a l c."""
"""All the applications that have c a l c in their name, will be listed."""
Observe here - both LibreOffice Calc and Calculator are listed.
Click on the Calculator icon. The Calculator application now opens on the screen.
"""Calculator  helps perform arithmetic, scientific or financial calculations."""
Let us try some simple calculation.
Type 5 asterisk 8 and click on the equal to (=) sign.
"""Instead of clicking on the equal to sign, you can also press the Enter  key on the keyboard."""
The answer is displayed on the Calculator.
"""Likewise, we can do all sort of calculations using the Calculator application."""
"""Now, exit this Calculator  by clicking on this tiny  X icon at the top left of the window."""
Let’s get familiar with some other important applications in Ubuntu Linux OS.
"""For that, we will go back to Dash home."""
"""In the Search bar, let’s type gedit. gedit is the default Text Editor in the Ubuntu Linux OS."""
The Text Editor icon appears below. Let’s click on it to open it.
"""What you see right now on the screen, is the gedit Text Editor  window."""
"""Let me type some text here. For example, type: """"Hello World""""."""
"""To save the file, press Ctrl and S keys simultaneously on the keyboard."""
"""Alternately, we can click on File and then on Save."""
"""Now, a dialog box named “Save as” opens up. It asks for a filename  and the location where the file has to be saved."""
"""So, let’s type the name as """"Hello.txt""""."""
.txt is the default extension of a text file.
"""And for location, let’s select Desktop. And, click on the Save  button at the bottom."""
Let's close this gedit window now by clicking on the tiny X icon at the top left of the window.
"""On the Desktop, we can see the file Hello.txt. This means our text file  was saved successfully."""
Let me open this file  by double-clicking on it.
"""See, our text file has opened with our written text."""
The internet  has a lot of information on gedit Text Editor.
"""There are some spoken tutorials available on this topic also, on this website."""
Let's close this text editor  and look at another application  i.e the Terminal.
"""So, let's go to Dash home once again. Now type the word terminal  in the search bar field."""
Click on the Terminal icon that appears below.
The terminal window opens on the screen. Please note: The shortcut to open the Terminal is Ctrl+Alt+T keys.
The terminal is also called the command line. This is because you can command the computer from here.
"""In fact, it is more powerful than the GUI."""
Let me switch back to the Terminal window.
Now let ’s type a simple command  to get a feel of the terminal. Type 'ls'  and press Enter.
You can see a list  of all the files  and folders  in the current directory.
"""Here, it is displaying files and folders from the Home folder."""
"""We will see later in this tutorial, what the Home folder is."""
We will not spend any more time with the terminal now.
Close the terminal by clicking on the tiny X icon at the top left of the window.
Terminal  commands are explained well in the Linux  spoken-tutorial series on this website.
"""Now, let's move on to another application  i.e Firefox Web Browser."""
"""Once again, open Dash home. Type Firefox  in the search bar."""
Click on the Firefox Web Browser  icon.
Firefox Web Browser  is used to access the world wide web. Now we can see that Firefox browser window is open.
"""Let ’s go to the spoken tutorial website. For that, click on the address bar  or press F6  on the keyboard."""
"""Now let’s type """"spoken-tutorial.org"""" and press Enter."""
"""If you have Internet connectivity, then Firefox will connect to the given website."""
The Spoken Tutorial Homepage  opens on the browser.
Let's close this as explained earlier and move on to the next application.
"""So, let's go to Dash home  once again and type office  in the search bar."""
"""You'll see various LibreOffice  components like Calc, Impress, Writer and Draw."""
LibreOffice is the default office application in Ubuntu Linux OS.
Excellent tutorials for all these components are available on the Spoken Tutorial website.
Now let's explore the Video  option.
Type video  in the search bar.
"""In the displayed list, we have one application  named Videos."""
"""Videos is used to play videos and songs. By default, it plays open format  video files only."""
"""So, let me play a sample file from my pen-drive."""
"""Now, I am inserting my pen-drive  in a usb slot  on my machine. The pen-drive folder  has opened  automatically."""
"""If it does not open, we can access it from the launcher."""
Locate the pen-drive icon  on the launcher.
"""If we click on it, it shows the files  and folders  available on the pen-drive."""
Now I will select the movie file big buck bunny.ogv to play.
"""Here is my file. I will double-click on it, to open."""
"""It opens in Videos, by default."""
Let's stop playing the movie.
"""Let us now press Ctrl, Windows and D keys to go to the Desktop."""
Now let's see some other important things on this Desktop.
Notice the folder icon  present in the launcher. Let's click on it.
The Home folder opens.
Every user has a unique Home folder in Ubuntu Linux.
"""We can say that the Home folder  is our house where we can store our files  and folders. Unless we permit, others cannot see them."""
More information on file permissions  is available in the Linux  spoken-tutorial series.
"""Let’s switch back. In our Home folder, we can see other folders such as- Desktop, Documents, Downloads,  etc."""
"""In Linux, everything is a file. Let ’s open the Desktop folder  by double -clicking on it."""
"""Here, we can see that the same """"hello.txt""""  file that we saved from the text editor."""
"""So, this folder  and the Desktop  are the same."""
Let me close this folder now. That’s all for this tutorial. Let us summarise.
"""In this tutorial we learnt about- the Ubuntu Desktop, the launcher and some of the icons  available on it,"""
"""few common applications like- Calculator, Text Editor, Terminal, Firefox Web Browser, Videos and LibreOffice Suite components  and the Home folder."""
"""The Spoken Tutorial Project team conducts workshops using spoken tutorials and gives certificates on passing online test. For more details, please write to us."""

"""This will help reduce the clutter. With less clutter, we can use these discussion as instructional material."""
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on the Mozilla Firefox Interface and Toolbars.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the Firefox interface and the toolbars."""
"""In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 for Ubuntu 10.04."""
Let’s now take a look at the Firefox interface.
Firefox has all the features that a modern browser needs to have.
"""To learn how to use Mozilla Firefox effectively, one should be familiar with each of its features."""
"""The Mozilla Firefox interface can be split up into 6 distinct areas, namely-"""
"""The Menu bar, the Navigation toolbar, the Bookmarks bar, the Side bar, the Status bar, and the Content area."""
Let’s look at each of these and learn what it does.
Let's click on the File menu and click on New Window.
A new window pops up.
Some people have trouble looking at small script in their browser.
"""So, let's zoom into the page by clicking on View > Zoom and Zoom In."""
"""Alternately, you can press Ctrl + +."""
This will make the text bigger.
"""To know which version of Mozilla Firefox you are using, click on Help and About Firefox."""
"""By default, Firefox displays a Homepage."""
"""But, to set your own preferred webpage as Homepage, click on Edit and Preferences."""
Windows users please click on Tools and Options.
"""In the General tab, click on Home Page field and type: ‘www.yahoo.com’ or any of your preferred webpage."""
Now you can close Firefox Preferences window by clicking the Close button on the bottom right hand corner.
You can use the Edit menu to search for particular words within the webpage.
"""In the address bar, type: ‘www.google.com’"""
Click on Edit and Find.
A small toolbar appears at the bottom of the browser window.
"""In the textbox, type the word ‘Gujarati’."""
You will observe that the word ‘Gujarati’ on the page gets highlighted.
This function is very useful when searching through large text on a webpage.
Let's close this.
"""As the name suggests, the Navigation toolbar helps you navigate through the internet."""
The Navigation bar is the large text box where you type the address of the webpage that you want to visit.
It is called the URL bar or Address bar.
Click on the URL and delete the address that is already there.
"""Now, type: ‘www.google.com’."""
Press the Enter key.You will now be in the Google Homepage.
Clicking on the 'back-arrow' icon will take you back to the page where you were before.
Click on the forward arrow to go back to the Google homepage.
"""To the right of the URL bar, is an icon shaped like a house."""
This button takes you back to the default home page from whichever webpage you are on.
This function is useful when you are browsing from a particular site or a search engine.
Let's click on the homepage button.
"""Remember, we changed the 'home page' to ‘www.yahoo.com’ earlier on."""
"""As a result, clicking on the homepage button brings us to the """"yahoo"""" homepage."""
Now let's look at the Bookmarks bar.
'Bookmarks' help you navigate to pages that you visit or refer to often.
"""In the URL bar, type: ‘www.gmail.com’."""
"""Once the page loads, click on the star symbol to the right of the URL bar."""
You see that the star turns yellow.
Click on the star again.A dialog box pops up.
"""From the ‘Folder’ drop down menu, choose 'Bookmarks toolbar'."""
Observe that the 'Gmail' bookmark is now added to the Bookmarks toolbar.
"""Click on the Homepage icon to go to the """"yahoo"""" homepage."""
Click on the 'Gmail'  bookmark.  This will direct you to the Gmail  login page.
You can use the bookmarks bar for sites which you visit often but don’t want to have as your homepage.
Next we will look at the Sidebar.
Click on View and Sidebar and then click on History.
"""You see that the bar on the left side now has 3 options - Today, Yesterday and Older than 6 months."""
The displayed option is subject to the intervals between the usage of Firefox on that computer.
"""Click on the plus sign, next to the Today icon, to expand the menu."""
"""Choose the """"google"""" link to be directed back to the google homepage."""
See how easy it is to go back to the site that you visited before!
The Sidebar even has a Search function of its own.
"""You can type in the name of the site that you want to search for, in the search box."""
This will then search through your history to find it.
"""In the search box, type: """"google""""."""
"""The """"google"""" homepage comes up as the first result."""
You can make the Sidebar disappear by clicking the small ‘x’ on the top right hand corner of the side bar.
"""Next, let's see what the Status bar does."""
The Status bar is the area at the bottom of your browser window that shows you the status of the site you are loading.
Go to the URL bar and type: ‘www.wired.com’ and press Enter key.
Look at the Status bar quickly. It shows you the status of the loading of that  webpage.
"""The Status bar can help you to understand why a particular site is not loading, the time it may take to load etc."""
"""Finally, let's look at the Content area."""
This is where you see the contents of the webpage you are viewing.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: the Firefox interface, the toolbars."""
Try this comprehension assignment..
Change your home page to ‘www.spoken-tutorial.org’  and navigate to it.
Then go to the ‘yahoo’ website by using the browser’s History function.

Today we'll talk about simple animation.
"""The package of GIMP animation is called GAP or GIMP Animation Package which can do a lot about Animations, Films and Movies."""
But we'll cover that later.
The oldest animations in Germany are called Daumenkino or Front Cinema.
And in English it's called Flip Book or Flick Book.
"""This book contains a lot of images which are nearly the same but slide modifications from page to page and if you flick through them, you get  little moving picture."""
"""This video here, is an animation too and you are looking at a slide show with 25 images per second."""
"""Here are two advertise, this is mine and this one from Rob which show animated gif."""
I want to improve my advertisement here.
I want to show in my advertisement the Meet The GIMP logo.
"""Now, I have to save this image to my desktop and I have to successfully create an animation."""
"""So, now I steal my own image and save it on my desktop."""
I open this image with the GIMP.
Just pull it over to the tool box and here it is.
Let me enlarge this a bit here.
Basically there is no animation in this image but there is a stack of eight layers in the layer dialog.
And on the top you can see that this is a gif image which is indexed and has eight layers of 80 by 80 pixels.
This image is made out of 256 different colours.
And to look at these colours go to Dialogs and Colormap.
Here you can see the colours which are used in this image and there is lot of blue and some other colours and each colour has an index and the HTML notation.
"""So, 'gif' images are indexed and not 'rgb' images and so they have only one limited colour available."""
Now let's look at the frames here.
You can see that the 1st layer is named as Background and in bracket it is in milliseconds i.e 5 Seconds.
"""So, this image is shown for 5 seconds and then follows the frames 2,3,4 with 100 milliseconds and there is an option of replace."""
"""To see the frames, I just press the Shift key and hold and click on the eye here and all the other frames are made invisible."""
"""And now I can stack them on the top, here."""
There is a draw back of using the index colours.
You can see lot of spots in here because these tile has only 256 different colours available.
"""So, this here is my background image."""
And this is the other one and also the other image I used in this animation and this drawing was  made by the people instead of following the lesson and I have used it with his permission.
And the rest of the images are simply mixtures of the other images to get a smooth way from one to the other.
"""To recreate this animation, I have to take two images out of this stack which is very easy."""
Just click on the thumbnail here and hold the mouse button and draw it up to the toolbox.
And here is my first image.
Now click here and this one here is my second image.
"""So, I have these two images here and I can close my original animation and I don’t want to save anything of it."""
Now I wanted to include the Meet the GIMP logo.
Just pull it over to the tool box and here it is.
I have to rescale it down to 80 by 80 pixels and then I have to include white colour as my background because black would be too harsh with this image.
"""And to do that, I just add a new layer, fill it with  white and pull it down and now I have white as my background."""
Right click into the layer dialog  and select Flatten image.
Now I have a flat Meet The GIMP  logo on white.
"""Now, go to Image, Scale Image  and I want to have 80 pixels and in Interpolation, Cubic  is good. Click on  Scale."""
And now the image is rescaled but it is way too soft.
"""After rescaling, you have to sharpen it."""
"""So, I go to Filters >> Enhance  >> Sharpen."""
"""I think, I should go fairly high with the sharpness."""
I think this is good.
Now I have three images waiting for becoming one animation.
One thing I have nearly forgotten is saving these basic images.
"""The 1st one is this here, Meet The GIMP and I Save it as """"mtg80.xcf""""."""
And this one here too.
"""Other way to access  menu is, right click into the image and go to Image >> Mode and RGB."""
Then go to File and Save As.
I will use this image as my base.
"""So, I save it again and this time as the copy."""
"""And I call it """"avatar.xcf""""."""
"""Yes, I want to replace it, I have done that before."""
"""Go to File, Open."""
"""So, here this is my basic image."""
"""And the 1st thing I want to do is, blend this image with Meet The GIMP Logo."""
"""And for that, I make a copy of this one and mix it with the logo."""
"""I select this image by clicking and pulling this into my tool box and here I have my layer. And now, I select the logo and pull it over to this image and you get a scrap layer which is untitled and it will n"
Now I have here two layers with my images.
And I want to have 3 steps between these 2 layers.
For doing that I choose a transparency of let's say about 25%.
"""Now, I flatten this image and pull it to my """"avatar.xcf"""" image."""
I'll change these names later on.
"""I go back to the untitled image, go to Edit and Undo."""
Now I set the transparency to about 50%.
"""Right click on the layer and select Flatten image and before pulling this, I just rename the layer as frame X and in bracket I type 100 milliseconds."""
"""Now I pull this to """"avatar.xcf"""" and go back to my image."""
I press Ctrl + Z and change the Opacity of the top layer to say something about 75%.
Right click on the layer and select Flatten image.
I pull this layer to this image.
And that’s it for this animation step.
"""Now, I have to pull the logo to this image and here I have my first 3 layers of blending."""
And now I just close the scrap layer here and don’t save it.
Now we’ll look how this has worked out.
But before that I save my work here.
And now I go to Filters >> Animation and Playback.
Here is my animation.
I click on Play.
First I have to change the names of these layers before playing it.
You can rename the layers the same way as with the lot of other image word processing options.
"""Just mark the text, press Ctrl + C and double click on the next layer and press Ctrl + V and change the necessary stuff."""
Now all the frames have their proper names.
"""So I go back to my image, select Filters >> Animation >> Playback and let's look at this here."""
You see the basic image.
And it is transformed to the other image but it is very quick.
It could be little bit slower.
So I’ll change the timing to say 200 milliseconds.
So again Filters >> Animation >> Playback.
I think this is better.
The last thing to do is index this image and save it as a 'gif' image. And this is easily done.
Just go to File >> Save As and then change the Name extension to 'gif' and click on Save.
Then I get an option dialog.
And 'gif' cannot handle these layers here.
And it can only handle animation frames.
"""So, I want to save it as Animation."""
'gif' can handle only greyscale or indexed images.
"""So, I want to convert it to index result."""
These are the default settings I found. They are good enough for my stuff and I can change it but I don’t think it's necessary.
"""So, I click on Export."""
Here you can see Created With GIMP and Loop forever.
"""In Frame disposal, I want to replace One frame per layer."""
"""And these other options are unchecked, so I leave them unchecked. Because if I want to change the timings to 5000 or 2000 milliseconds then I can do it."""
Now click on Save and we will look at the result.
"""And for that, we'll not use GIMP but Mozilla."""
In Mozilla it works as expected.
Good bye up to next week.
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on Loops in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about- while, do-while, for  and more looping constructs in awk."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and gedit text editor 3.20.1."""
You can use any text editor of your choice.
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the previous awk tutorials on our website."""
You should have familiarity with any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
A loop allows us to perform one or more actions repeatedly.
"""while, do-while and for are the available loops in awk."""
The syntax of 'while' loop can be seen here.
While loop first checks whether the specified condition is true.
"""If yes, then it executes the code within the body. This loop will be repeated as long as the specified while condition is true."""
We will use the same awkdemo.txt file that we have used earlier.
I have already written a script named while_loop.awk.
The same file is available in the Code Files link of this tutorial.
"""Here, we have set the field separator as Pipe symbol."""
"""Initially, we have to set the value of the loop variable i as 1."""
"""Here, we have taken one more variable f and initialized it to 1."""
Variable f represents the field counter or the position of the fields for each record.
"""Now, in the while condition, we check if i is less than or equal to 3."""
"""If yes, then it will print the value in the fth field, for that record in awkdemo.txt file."""
Then we will increment the field counter f by 1.
"""After that, we will also increment the value of loop variable i by 1."""
This printf is for printing a newline character at the end of each row.
This loop will be executed for all the records in the awkdemo.txt file.
"""Which means, the first 3 fields will get printed for each record."""
Let’s execute this code now.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using cd command.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space while_loop.awk space awkdemo.txt. Press Enter."""
Observe that we get the first three fields of all the rows in the output.
Let us do the same with the do-while loop.
The syntax of do-while loop can be seen here.
The do-while loop always executes the code inside the body once.
"""Then it checks the specified condition. And, repeats the code inside the body, as long as the specified conditionis true."""
I have already written a script and named it as do_loop.awk. The same file is available in the Code Files link.
"""In this code, these are the statements within the do loop which will be executed first. This is the condition that will be checked."""
"""After that, the statements inside the loop will be executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true."""
"""This loop will iterate for all the records in the awkdemo.txt file. Which means, the first 3 fields will get printed for all the records."""
Let’s switch to the terminal. Let me clear the terminal.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space do underscore loop dot awk space awkdemo dot txt. Press Enter."""
We get the same output. Then why do we have both while and do-while loops?
Let us understand the difference.
Switch to the file while underscore loop dot awk.
"""Now, change the value of loop counter i from 1 to 4."""
"""This will make the specified condition false from the beginning. So, this means, we should not get any output."""
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
"""Clear the terminal. Now, press  the up-arrow key until you get the command for executing the while loop."""
"""See, we are not getting any output apart from blank lines."""
"""For each record in the awkdemo.txt file, blank lines are getting printed in the output."""
"""Now, let us make some changes in the do loop file."""
Switch to the file do underscore loop dot awk.
Change the value of i from 1 to 4.
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Clear the terminal. Now press the up-arrow key until you get the command for do loop. Press Enter.
"""In the output, only the first field for each row is printed. What is the reason?"""
"""For each row, awk first prints the value at the first field  because value of variable f is initialized to 1. Then the condition is checked."""
"""Since the value of the loop counter i is 4, then the condition is false. Hence, the loop is terminated there only, for that record."""
This loop will iterate for all the records in the awkdemo.txt file.
"""Which means, the first field for each record will get printed."""
We are getting the output at least once for each record.
"""Use the do-while loop for a job to be executed at least once, irrespective of any other condition."""
We can do the same with the for loop also.
The syntax of for loop can be seen here.
The 'for' statement starts by executing initialization.
"""Then, as long as the condition is true, it repeatedly executes the statements within and then increments."""
"""Assuming your familiarity with a language like C or C++, I am not explaining the syntax in detail."""
This is how  for loop for this condition looks like.
"""Here, initialization, condition checking and variable incrementation are done in the same line."""
Try this out by yourself.
"""There are some more looping constructs:  break,  continue,  exit."""
We will see some relevant examples on these in further tutorials.
We may have a single and multiline comments in our file.
"""Here, notice that the single line comments are declared with single hash (#) symbol."""
The multiline comments are declared with the help of double hash (##) symbol.
"""Now, there is no point of checking and printing these comments in the output."""
We have to skip the lines starting with hash (##) symbol. How can we do this?
Recall the case of giving 50% increment in the stipend for those who are getting more than 8000.
We will use the same example for skipping the comments.
"""I have created a file named next.awk as shown here, for this execution."""
"""Now, what does this command mean?"""
awk will search for the pattern caret sign hash symbol(^#) at the beginning of each line.
"""If the pattern is found, the keyword next tells awk to skip the current line immediately."""
Then awk will start processing from the next line in the file. This will save the processing time.
Switch to the terminal and type the command as shown here. Press Enter.
We get the output without any comments.
"""Suppose, we have the students’ records in multiple files with the same format. Say, in awkdemo_mod.txt and awkdemo2.txt."""
"""See, it is similar to our previous file."""
It also has comments preceded with hash  symbol.
"""And, it has large text at the end with double hash ## symbol."""
"""So, our data is in two different files. awk should process both the files to give an increment to all the students."""
"""Once we reach double hash(##) symbol of the first file, awk should stop processing that file entirely."""
Then it has to start the execution from the next file. This will save the processing time.
Modify the next.awk as shown here.
"""I have added: dollar zero tilde slash caret symbol double hash slash within braces nextfile semicolon, below the BEGIN statement."""
This will search for double hash # symbol at the beginning of each line.
"""If found, awk will skip the current file to process the next file."""
Save this file.
Switch to the the terminal and type the following command. Press Enter.
"""See, we are getting the output from both the files."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learnt about-  while,  do… while,  for,  next,  nextfile in awk."""
"""As an assignment for the student records of awkdemo2.txt,  print only even fields(i.e. field 2, field 4 etc.)  irrespective of how many fields are there in the input file."""
"""The Spoken Tutorial Project team conducts workshops using spoken tutorials and gives certificates on passing online tests. For more details, please write to us."""
Do you have questions in THIS Spoken Tutorial? Please visit this site.
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Linux File Attributes.
"""The prerequisite for this tutorial is to create empty files named as  example1, example2, example3, example4, example5 and testchown."""
Please create empty directories named as test_chown and directory1 also.
A file attribute is metadata that describes or is associated with a computer file.
"""File attribute is the characteristics that describe a file, such as owner, file type, access permissions, etc."""
"""c-h own command is used to change the ownership of the file or directory. This is an admin command, root user only can change the owner of a file or directory."""
The syntax of the chown command is: chown space options space ownername space filename or directoryname.
We may give the following options with chown command.
-R : To change the permission on files that are in the sub-directories of the directory that you are currently in.
-c : Change the permission for each file.
-f : Prevents ch own from displaying error messages.
"""Now, we will look at some examples."""
"""So, go to the terminal. We will move to the directory where we have created empty files and folders. For that, cd space Desktop slash file attribute and press Enter."""
Now type the command: ls space -l space testchown that is t-e-s-t-c-h-o-w-n and press Enter.
"""Here we can see the owner of the testchown is """"shahid""""."""
"""To change the owner of the file, type the command sudo space c-h own space a-n-u-s-h-a anusha space testchown that is t-e-s-t-c-h-o-w-n  and press Enter."""
Enter the sudo password and press Enter again. Press Enter.
"""Now type: ls space -l space t-e-s-t-c-h-o-w-n and press Enter. Here, we can see the new owner of the file is """"anusha""""."""
Now we will see how to change owner of the directory.
"""Type the command:  ls space -l and  press Enter. Here we can see the owner of the directory test_chown is """"shahid""""."""
"""To change the owner of the directory, type the command:"""
sudo space chown space minus capital R space a-n-u-s-h-a anusha space test_chown which is directory name and press Enter.
"""Enter the sudo password, if required, and press Enter again."""
"""I will clear the screen by pressing Clt+L for our convenience. Now type: ls space -l  and press Enter. Here we can see the new owner of the directory is """"anusha""""."""
chmod command is used to change the access mode or permissions of one or more files.
Syntax of the chmod command is:  chmod space [options] space mode space filename We may give the following options with the chmod command-
-c : Print information about files that are changed.
-f : Do not notify user of files that chmod cannot change.
There are following types of access or permissions-
r: that is Read w: that is Write  x: that is Execute  s: that is Set user (or group) ID.
"""Alternatively, we may specify permissions by a three-digit octal-number."""
"""The first digit stands for owner permission, the second stands for group permission and the third stands for other permission."""
Permissions are calculated by adding the following octal values- 4: that is Read  2: that is Write  1: that is Execute.
Now we will look at some examples of chmod. Move to terminal and enter the command to add execute-by-user permission to file example1.
Before that I will again clear the screen by pressing Clt+l.
"""Now, let's type chmod space u+x space example1  press Enter."""
"""Now, type: ls space -l space example1  press Enter to see the changes."""
"""Here, you can see to assign the read/write/execute permission by owner,  read/execute permission by group, and execute-only permission by others to file 'example1'."""
Now type the command: chmod space 751 space example1 press Enter.
Now type:  ls space -l space example1  and press Enter.
"""Here we can see that above command has assigned the read/write/execute permission by owner, read/execute permission by group and execute-only permission by others to file example1."""
"""To assign read-only permission to file example1 for everyone, type the command:  chmod space =r space example1 and press Enter."""
Now type the command: ls space -l space example1 press Enter.
Here we can see that the read only permission has been assigned to file 'example1' for everyone.
"""To change the permission recursively and assign the read and execute access for everyone and also write access for the owner of the directory 'directory1', type the command:"""
chmod space minus capital R space 755 space directory1 press Enter.
Now type:  ls space -l  press Enter to see the changes.
"""To give the user execute permission on file 'example2',  type the command:  chmod space u+x space example2  press Enter."""
Now type the command:  ls space -l space example2  and press Enter.
"""Here, we can see that execute permission has been assigned to user on 'example2'."""
"""To add the write permissions to the group for file 'example3', type the command: chmod space g+w space example3. Press Enter."""
"""And now, type:  ls space -l space example3  press Enter."""
Here we can see the write permission has been added to group.
"""To remove the write permissions for all, type the command:  chmod space a-w space example3 press Enter."""
Now type:  ls space -l space example3  press Enter.
Here we can see the write permission for all has been removed.
chgrp command is used to change the group of one or more files to new group.
New group is either a group ID number or a group name located in /etc/group.
Only the owner of a file or a privileged user may change the group.
The syntax for the chgrp command is: chgrp space [options] space newgroup space files.
Let's go to terminal. Now we will look at some examples of chgrp command. Type the command  ls space -l space example4 press Enter.
"""Here we can see the group permission is for user """"shahid""""."""
"""To change the group permission, type the command: sudo space chgrp space rohit space example4."""
Press Enter. Enter the 'sudo' password if required.
Now type the command:  ls space -l space example4 . Press Enter.
"""Here we can see that the group has changed from """"shahid"""" to """"rohit""""."""
The inode-number is a unique integer assigned to a device.
Inode stores basic information about a regular file or a directory.
All the files are hard-links to inodes.
"""Whenever a program refers to a file by name, the system actually uses the filename to search for the corresponding inode."""
We can use  ls space -i command to see the inode-number of a file.
Type the command:  ls space -i space example5  press Enter.
Number written before the file is the inode-number of the file.
Inodes are associated with precisely one directory at a time.
Hard links are to associate multiple directory entries with a single inode. ln is the command to make link.
The syntax of ln command to create the hard link is:
ln space source space link  where source is an existing file and link is the file to create.
Now we will look at some examples of hard-links.
Let me clear the screen again. Now type the command: ln space example1 space exampleln press Enter.
"""To display the inode number of both the files, type the command: ls space -i space example1 space exampleln press Enter."""
Here we can see that inode number of both the files are same; file 'exampleln' is the hard-link for file 'example1'.
Soft-link i.e. symbolic link is a special type of file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path.
The syntax of ln command to create soft links is:
ln space -s space {target-filename} space {symbolic-filename}.
Now we will look at some examples of soft-link.
"""To create the soft-link, type the command: ln space -s space example1 space examplesoft ."""
Press Enter.
"""Now, to display the inode number and list of both the files, type the command: ls space -li space example1 space examplesoft."""
Press Enter.
Here we can see that inode number of both the files are different and 'examplesoft' is a soft-link of 'example1'.
"""So, in this tutorial we have learnt about the Linux Files Attributes like changing permission, ownership and group of a file."""
"""We also learnt about the inode, soft and hard-links of a file."""
This brings me to the end of this tutorial.
"""Spoken Tutorials are a part of the """"Talk to a Teacher"""" project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""
More information on the same is available at the following link.
This script is contributed by Anusha Ambala and Shahid. Thanks or joining.
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on the Linux environment and ways to manipulate it.
A working Linux system will be required to try out the examples illustrated in this tutorial.
"""We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands, file systems and shell."""
"""If you are interested or need to brush these concepts up, please feel free to do so through another spoken tutorial available on our website."""
Please note that Linux is case sensitive and all the commands used in this tutorial are in lower case unless otherwise mentioned.
"""The Linux environment determines how the operating system behaves with you, how it responds to your commands, how it interprets your actions and so on."""
Linux can be highly customized by changing the settings of the shell.
Let us understand how all this can be done.
The behavior of the shell is generally determined by the shell variables.
There are mainly two kinds of shell variables: Environment Variables and Local Variables.
"""Environment variables, named so because they are available entirely in the user's total environment."""
These are also available in sub-shells spawned by the shell like the ones for running shell scripts.
Local Variables which as the name suggests have a more restricted or limited availability.
These are not available in the sub-shells spawned by the shell.
"""While in this tutorial, we will mainly talk about environment variables. Let us first see how the value of these shell variables can be seen."""
"""To see all the variables available in the current shell, we run the command 'set'."""
Type at the terminal: set space pipeline character more and press Enter.
"""We can see all the current shell variables. ,"""
For example- take a look at the HOME environment variable; also notice the value assigned to it.
"""Press Enter to move through the list and in order to come out, press q."""
"""Here, the output from set was pipe-lined to more in order to display a more systematic multi-page output of the variable list."""
"""To see only the environment variables, run the command 'env'."""
Type at the terminal: env  space 'vertical-bar' more and press Enter.
"""For example, notice the SHELL variable whose value is slash bin slash bash."""
"""Again, you may press q to come out of the list."""
"""Now, let us discuss some of the more important environment variables in Linux."""
We would be using bash shell for all our demonstrations here.
Different shells are customized in slightly different ways.
"""To see what a variable actually stores, we have to prefix a dollar sign to the name of that variable and use the echo command along with it."""
The first environment variable that we would see is the SHELL variable.
It stores the name of the current shell.
"""To see what is the value of the SHELL variable, type at the terminal: echo space dollar S-H-E-L-L in capitals and press Enter."""
"""Here, slash bin slash bash is the shell where we are currently operating."""
The next variable is HOME.
"""When we login into Linux, it normally places us in a directory named after our user name."""
This directory is called the home directory and this is exactly what is available in the 'HOME' variable.
"""To see the value, type at the terminal: echo space dollar H-O-M-E in capital and press Enter."""
The next environment variable is  PATH.
The PATH variable contains the absolute paths of the directories that the shell is supposed to search for locating any executable command.
Let's see the value of the path variable.
"""Again, type at the terminal: echo space dollar P-A-T-H  in capitals and press Enter."""
"""On my computer, it shows slash user slash local slash bin slash user slash bin etc."""
This may slightly vary from one system to another.
"""It is actually a list of directories separated by the :(colon) delimiter, that the shell would search in this order for finding an executable command."""
We can also add our own directory to this list so that our directory is also searched by the shell.
"""In order to add our own directory, type at the terminal:"""
P-A-T-H in capitals 'equal-to' dollar P-A-T-H again in capital colon  slash home slash the name of my own home directory and press Enter.
"""Now, if we echo the value of PATH,"""
our added directory will also be a part of the PATH variable.
"""See, the directory is now present here."""
Another interesting variable is the LOGNAME.
It stores the username of the currently active user.
"""In order to see the value, type: echo space dollar LOGNAME and press Enter."""
"""When we open the terminal, we can see the dollar sign which is the prompt at which we enter all our commands."""
This is the primary prompt string represented by the environment variable 'PS1'.
There is a secondary prompt string also.
If our command is long and it spans for more than one line then from the second line onwards we can see a greater than sign “>” as the prompt.
This is the secondary prompt string represented by the environment variable 'PS2'.
"""To see the value of the 'secondary command prompt', type at the terminal: echo space dollar PS2  and press Enter."""
We may change our 'primary prompt string' to say “at the rate” (@) at the prompt.
"""In order to get this done, type:  PS1  'equal-to' now within quotes 'at the rate(@)' “ and press Enter."""
"""Now, instead of the dollar sign we can see the at the rate sign as the prompt."""
We may do something more interesting like- we may display our username at the prompt.
Just type: PS1 in capital 'equal-to' within quotes dollar LOGNAME and press Enter.
"""Now, my username is my prompt."""
"""To revert back, type: PS1 'equal-to' dollar ($) within quotes and press Enter."""
We have assigned values to many of the environment variables.
"""But, remember one thing that these modifications are only applicable for the current session"""
like we had just added our directory to the PATH variable.
"""If we close the terminal and open it again or open a new terminal altogether and check the 'path' variable by echoing its value,"""
we will be surprised to see that our modifications are no longer present.
The way by which we can make these modifications permanent will be covered in some advanced tutorial.
Often we want to re-execute a command that we had executed in the recent past. What do we do? Do we have to type the entire command again?
"""No, there are a number of solutions."""
"""First, normally if you press the up-key on your keyboard then it will show the last command that you have typed."""
Keep pressing it and it will keep scrolling through the previous commands.
"""To go back, press the down-key."""
"""But when you have to scroll through many commands, this becomes a little clumsy and tedious. A better way is to use the history command."""
Type at the prompt history
and press Enter; see a list of previously executed commands appears.
"""If instead of the large list, you wanted to see only the last ten,"""
type: history space 10' and press Enter.
"""Notice, in this list, there is a number assigned to each of the previously executed commands."""
"""In order to repeat a particular command,"""
"""just type an exclamation mark followed by the number of the command. For example- 442 in my case, would execute echo space dollar PATH."""
"""If you need to re-execute the last command, simply type exclamation mark twice and press Enter."""
The next thing we would see is called tilde substitution. The tilde(~) character is a shorthand for the home directory.
"""So, say you have a directory with the name 'testtree' in your home directory. You can move to it by typing: cd space ~(tilde) slash testtree."""
One may also toggle between the current working directory and the last directory used by giving the command: cd  '~(tilde)' minus or only cd  minus
"""Like now that we are in the testtree directory, the last directory we visited was the home directory."""
"""So, if we run cd space minus and press Enter, it will go to the home directory."""
Run it again and it will take us back to the testtree directory.
The last but quite important command we will see is the alias command.
It may quite happen that you have a large command that needs to be run again and again.
"""In this case, we can give it a short alias name and use the alias name instead to invoke it."""
"""Assuming that you have such a long directory hierarchy that you frequently visit for music, you may create an alias for it like this."""
Type: alias space cdMusic 'equal-to' within double quotes cd space slash home slash the name of my own home directory slash music  and press Enter.
"""Now, every time you need to switch to this directory, simply write cdMusic and press Enter."""
"""See, we are in the music directory now."""
"""Now, you may type cd space minus  and the prompt to go back to the previous working directory."""
"""To unset an alias, simply write unalias space cdMusic and press Enter."""
"""Now again if you fire cdMusic from the terminal, you will get an error stating that the command was not found."""
"""Suppose, we have two files- test1 and test2 in our present working directory"""
"""and if we fire rm test1, test1 is silently deleted."""
We know that hyphen i option of the rm command  makes the removal process interactive.
"""So, we may set an alias like, alias rm equal-to, now within quotes rm space hyphen i."""
"""Now, when we run rm, rm hyphen i will actually be run."""
"""So, we saw that while test1 was silently deleted, system asked before deleting test2."""
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learned about environment variables, history and aliasing."""
This brings me to the end of this tutorial.

More information on the same is available from our website.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on getting started with the First java program.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
To create a simple Java program
To compile the program
To run the program and
About the naming conventions followed in Java.
Here we are using Ubuntu version 11.10 and jdk 1.6.
"""To follow this tutorial, JDK 1.6 must be installed on your system."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorial, please visit our website which is as shown."""
"""Alright, now let us write our first Java program."""
"""For that, you need a Terminal and you need  a Text Editor."""
I am using gedit as my Text Editor.
"""In the text editor, we will first create the class HelloWorld."""
"""So, type: class HelloWorld. """"HelloWorld"""" is the name of the class."""
"""And, open curly bracket. Enter and close curly bracket."""
The code between these two curly brackets  will belong to the class 'HelloWorld'.
Now save the file by clicking on Save icon at the top.
It is a good practice to save the file frequently.
so Save As Dialog box  appears.
Browse the location where you want to save your file.
"""Here, in the home directory, I will create a folder."""
Let us name it Demo and press Enter.
"""Then, inside this folder we will save the file."""
"""In the Name text-box, type the name of the class."""
"""In Java, the name of the class and the file name should be same."""
Recall that we  created   class HelloWorld.
"""So, we will save the file as  HelloWorld dot java."""
Dot Java (.java) is the file extension  given to the Java file.
Then click on Save button. So the file is now saved.
"""Inside the class, we write the main method."""
"""So, type: public static void main parentheses inside   parentheses String arg square brackets."""
main function marks the starting point of the program.
"""We will describe public, static, void and String in a future tutorial."""
"""Then  once again, open curly bracket,"""
press Enter and close curly bracket.
The code between these two curly brackets will belong to the main method.
We will now write a code to display a line on the Terminal.
"""So, inside main method, type: System dot out dot println parentheses semicolon."""
This is the statement used to print a line.
Semicolon is used to terminate a line.
"""Now let us tell Java, what to print."""
"""So, within parentheses in double quotes, type: My first Java program exclamation mark."""
Let us save the file by clicking on Save icon.
Let's go to the Terminal.
Make sure that you are in the directory where  you saved your  'HelloWorld.java'
Remember that I am in my home directory.
"""So, type: cd Space Demo  and hit Enter."""
"""ls, press Enter."""
We see  'HelloWorld.java' file present in the 'Demo' folder.
"""Let's compile this file. So, type: javac Space  HelloWorld dot java and hit Enter."""
This compiles the file that we have created.
"""Alright, now the file is compiled as we see no error."""
We can see HelloWorld.class file created.
This file can run anywhere.
"""That is, on any Operating System."""
We do not need java compiler as well.
"""Hence, java is rightly described as “write once, run anywhere.”"""
"""So, after successful compilation, run the program using the command,"""
java(This time no c) space HelloWorld(and no dot java extension) and hit Enter.
You  will get the output My first java program!
"""So, we have written our first java program. Let us go back to the editor."""
"""Now, remove the semicolon  which is at the end of the statement."""
Click on Save icon.
Let us go back to the Terminal.
Run the command javac HelloWorld dot java.
The compiler gives an error.
"""It says, a semicolon (;) is expected on the fifth line."""
The up-arrow points to the error statement.
Let us go back to the Editor.
"""In Java, all statements are terminated with semicolons."""
"""So, go to the fifth line and add a semicolon."""
Click on the Save icon. It is necessary to save the file before compiling.
Compile the file using javac HelloWorld dot java.
The file is successfully compiled as we see no errors.
"""Now, run the program using the command java HelloWorld and"""
we see the output My first Java program!
This is how you handle errors in java.
"""As the series progresses, we will learn more about the errors."""
We now see what are the naming conventions in java.
The class name should be in CamelCase
which means each new word begins with an upper case.
"""Example: class HelloWorld, class ChessGame."""
"""So, 'H' of 'Hello' and  'W' of 'World' are in uppercase."""
"""Similarly, 'C' and 'G' of 'ChessGame' respectively are in uppercase."""
The method name should be the mixed case.
which means that the first word should begin with a lowercase.
and all new words followed should begin with an uppercase.
Also the method name should be a verb.
"""For Example: showString(), main(), goToHelp(). Here 's' of show is in lowercase while 'S' of string is in uppercase."""
The variable name should not begin with digits.
"""We cannot use keywords for our class, method or variable name."""
"""For example:  cannot use keywords like public, private, void, static and many more."""
"""So in this tutorial, we have learnt to write, compile and run a simple java program."""
We also saw the naming conventions followed in java.
"""For self assessment, write a simple java program to print """"Java file name and class name should be same""""."""

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Installation of Koha on Ubuntu Linux OS.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to install Koha Library Management System on Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04  and cross-verify the installation."""
"""This tutorial is recorded using:  Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04, Koha version 16.05,"""
gedit text editor and   Firefox web browser.
"""Before you start, please ensure that your machine has-  Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04,"""
"""any text editor, either Firefox or Google Chrome web browser."""
"""The minimum hardware requirements are-  i3 processor or above,"""
"""500GB hard disk or more,"""
Minimum 4GB RAM and  Network facility.
The commands used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link below the player.
"""I have opened this file in gedit text editor on my machine. And, I will use the same file to copy paste the commands during the demonstration."""
Let’s begin. Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously on the keyboard.
We have to first of all ensure that our Ubuntu Linux installation is up-to-date.
"""For that, copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
"""From now on, type the System password whenever prompted during this installation. And, press Enter."""
This command will create a file named koha.list and update the package repository.
Please note: Koha 16.05 was the stable version at the time of creation of this tutorial.
"""Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
"""Then, this will download gpg.asc file and update the signature key."""
"""Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
"""Now, copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
This will update the new repositories.
"""Now, type sudo apt-get install koha-common and press Enter."""
Press Y when asked if you want to continue and press Enter.
This will install Koha on your system. Wait for the installation to complete. This will take some time.
"""Now, we have to open the conf file in a text editor to change the port number for Koha."""
I will use gedit text editor. You can use any text editor of your choice.
"""Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
The file opens in the text editor.
Locate the line that says INTRAPORT = 80.
Change 80 to 8080. This will change the port number to 8080.
Then save and close the file.
"""Now, we have to set up the database."""
Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. Press Enter.
Press Y when asked if you want to continue and press Enter.
"""Next, set the password for root user as admin123 for the database."""
You could give a different password if you wish.
Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. Press Enter.
"""Next, copy these two commands one by one, paste them on the terminal and press Enter."""
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod cgi
This will enable the modules of Koha.
Then type: sudo service apache2 restart
This will restart apache services.  Then press Enter.
To create a Koha instance named library- copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And press Enter.
"""Next, we have to tell Apache server that we are using port 8080."""
"""For that, we have to open the ports.conf file in a text editor."""
Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And press Enter.
"""In the ports.conf file, search for the line Listen 80."""
"""Next to that line, add Listen 8080."""
Then save and close the file.
Then restart apache services. Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. Press Enter.
"""Next, copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And press Enter."""
This is to disable the 000-default site.
The message confirms that it is  disabled. Let's move on.

We are now in the superuser that is root user mode.
"""Type the password when prompted, admin123 and press Enter."""
We are now inside our MariaDB prompt.
"""At the MariaDB prompt, type: use mysql semicolon and press Enter."""
This is to tell MariaDB to use mysql database.
The message displayed on the terminal says Database changed.
Notice that the MariaDB prompt says mysql.
Now type the following command carefully as shown and press Enter.
This will set the password for the user koha_library as koha123.
We see a message on the terminal that says “Query OK”.
"""Next, type: flush privileges semicolon and press Enter. This will update the latest changes."""
Once again we see a message on the terminal that says “Query OK”.
"""Lastly, type: quit semicolon and press Enter to exit from Mariadb."""
We are now back in the root user prompt.
We will now open the koha-conf.xml file in a text editor.
I will be doing so using gedit text editor.
"""In this file, search for the keyword 'mysql'."""
Scroll down and locate this line.
Replace the alphanumeric value with 'koha123'.
Recall that this is the password we had set for our database earlier via the terminal.
Save the file and close the editor window.
Now open any web browser. I will be opening Firefox web browser.
"""In the address bar, type: 127.0.0.1:8080 and press Enter."""
The Koha web installer page appears on the browser.
"""To login, use the credentials we set earlier."""
I will type username as koha_library and password as koha123.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Courses in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn: how to create a course and how to perform actions on courses."""
"""To record this tutorial, I will be using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04,""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30, Moodle 3.3  and Firefox web browser."""
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
Learners of this tutorial should know how to create categories in Moodle.
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and open your Moodle homepage. Make sure that XAMPP service is running.
Login with your admin username and password details.
We are now in the admin dashboard.
Click on the drawer menu to open the navigation menu on the left.
"""On the left side, click on Site Administration."""
Click on the Courses tab and then on Manage courses and categories.
Note that we have only one category here which is Mathematics.
And two subcategories: 1st Year Maths and 2nd Year Maths which we created earlier.
"""Now, let us create a new course under Mathematics."""
"""So, click on Create new course."""
"""And, in the Add a new course screen, click on Expand All at the top right, in order to view all the fields."""
"""In the Course full name text-box, we will type Calculus."""
"""In Course short name, we will again type Calculus."""
Course short name will be used in the breadcrumbs and course related emails.
This can also be different from the course full name.
"""Course Category is Mathematics, as we can see."""
"""Next option is Course visibility. By default, Show is selected."""
The Visible setting determines whether the course will be shown along with other courses or not.
"""A hidden course is visible only to those assigned to the course, like- Admin, Course creator, Teacher, Manager."""
"""We will leave this setting as it is, for now."""
Next comes the Course start date.
"""If the course begins on a particular date like semester start date, select that in the start date."""
This means the course will not be visible to the students till the start date.
"""Course end date, by default, is enabled and set to the same date that the course is created."""
Let me disable it by clicking on the checkbox. This would mean that the course will never end.
"""However, if there is an end date for the course, you can enable the checkbox here. Then select the date as per your requirement."""
Important note: The course will not be visible to the students after the selected end date. I will leave it disabled.
Course ID number is similar to Category ID number. Course ID number is an optional field.
This is for admin users to identify the course with offline courses.
"""If your college uses IDs for courses, then you can use that course ID here. This field is not visible to other Moodle users."""
This field is optional and is not displayed anywhere on the website. I am going to leave this as blank.
"""Next, under Description, we can see 2 fields: Course Summary and Course Summary files."""
Course summary is an optional but important field. That is because the course summary text is also scanned when a user performs a search.
"""Listing topic names is a good idea here. Type the following:Topics covered in this Calculus course are: Limits,Graph of a function, Factorial."""
Course summary is also displayed along with the list of courses.
Course summary files must be uploaded in Course summary files field.
"""By default, only jpg, gif and png file types are allowed as course summary files. I will skip this as I do not wish to upload any file."""
Course format refers to the way resources and activities are organized for students.
"""There are 4 options in the Format dropdown - Single Activity Format, Social Format, Topics Format and Weekly Format."""
There are courses that run week by week.
"""If your course is like that, then select Weekly format."""
"""Moodle will create a section for each week of the course, with a clear start date and an end date."""
"""There are courses that run topic wise. If your course is like that, then select Topics   format."""
Moodle will create a section for each topic of the course.
The default for this field is Topics format. We will let it remain as it is.
"""The number of sections, by default, is 4."""
"""If you have your course divided in more or less than 4 topics, change this field as required. I will make this number as 5."""
We will discuss the other formats in later tutorials.
Let’s leave the rest of the options as they are. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Save and display button.
We are redirected to the Enrolled Users page. We will learn about user enrollment in a later tutorial.
"""For now, we have successfully created our first course Calculus under the category Mathematics."""
"""While we are on this course page, notice that the menu on the left has changed."""
"""The navigation menu on the left has menus related to the course we created. These include Participants, Grades etc."""
Click on the course name Calculus on the left.
"""We can see that 5 topics are visible here. They are named Topic 1, Topic 2 and so on. Recall we had given this number 5 earlier."""
Click on the gear icon at the top right of the page.
"""Then click on Edit settings. This will open a page similar to the page we were on, when we created this course."""
We can make changes to the previous settings on this page. I will change the Course start date to 15th October 2017.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Save and display button.
We will explore the other sub-menus under the gear menu later.
Let us now change the structure of our course a little bit.
Click on Site administration. Click on Courses and then Manage courses and categories.
Click on Mathematics category to see the course we created. Notice 3 icons on the right of the course.
Hover over the icons to see what they are.
The gear icon is for editing a course. The delete or trash icon is for deleting a course.
"""And, the eye icon is for hiding a course."""
A hidden course will have the eye crossed to indicate the same.
"""We can click on the gear icon to the right of the course name, to edit the course settings."""
I want to modify the Course Summary and add Binomials to the existing topics. Rest of the settings can remain the same.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and this time click on the Save and return button.
Here is a small assignment for you: create a new course Linear Algebra under the category Mathematics.
Hide this course for now.
"""Mention the following topics in course summary: Linear equations, Matrices and Vectors. Click on Save and Return button."""
Pause the tutorial and continue when done with the assignment.
We now have 2 courses under Mathematics: Calculus and Linear Algebra.
Notice that a new icon has appeared next to the courses now.
The up and down arrows are to re-arrange the order of the courses.
We can also change the order using the drag and drop feature. Let us move the Calculus course above the Linear Algebra course.
"""Both these courses are for 1st year students. So, let us move them under the 1st Year Maths subcategory."""
Check the checkbox to the left of the 2 courses in order to select them.
"""Then in the drop-down Move selected courses to, select Mathematics / 1st year Maths."""
And click on the Move button.
We get a success message -Successfully moved 2 courses into 1st year Maths.
Note that the number of courses under Mathematics has become 0 and that under 1st year Maths is 2.
Click on 1st year Maths sub-category.
We can see our courses listed under this subcategory.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt: how to create a course, how to perform actions like edit, move, etc. on courses."""
"""Here is an assignment for you: Add 2 courses to the subcategory 2nd Year Maths under Mathematics, namely-"""
Multivariable calculus and   Advanced Algebra.

Edit the courses to start on 15th October 2017.
Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Arrays in C and C++.
In this tutorial we will learn:
What is an array
Declaration of an array
Initialization of an array
Few Examples on array.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04,gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 ."
Let us start with the introduction to Array.
Array is the collection of data or elements of same data-type.
Array index starts from 0.
The first element is stored at index 0.
There are three types of arrays:
Single dimensional array
Two dimensional array and
Multi-dimensional array.
We will be discussing single dimensional array in this tutorial.
Let us see how to declare single dimensional array.
The Syntax for this is:
data-type name of the array and size
"""example, here we have declared an integer array 'star' which contains 5 elements."""
The array index will start from star 0 to star 4.
We saw the declaration of an array.
"""Now, we will see the initialization of an array."""
The Syntax for this is:
"""data-type,( name of the array ), size is equal to elements"""
"""example: here we have declared an 'integer array star' with size 3. The elements of the array are 1,2 and 3."""
Here the index will start from star 0 to star 2.
"""Now, lets us move to the examples."""
I have already typed the program on the editor.
"""So, let me open it."""
Please note that our file name is array.c
"""In this program, we will calculate the sum of the elements stored in an array."""
This is our main() function.
"""Here, we have declared and initialized an array star with size 3."""
"""The elements of the array are 4, 5 and 6."""
Then we have declared an 'integer variable' sum.
Here we add the elements of the array and store the result in sum.
"""Note that 4 will be stored at index 0, 5 will be stored at index 1 and 6 will be stored at index 2."""
Then we print the sum.
This is our return statement.
"""Now, click on Save."""
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T  keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space array dot c space hypen o array and press Enter."""
"""To execute, type dot slash array (./array). Press Enter."""
"""Here the output is displayed as,"""
The sum is 15.
Now let us see some common errors which we can come across.
Come back to our program.
"""Suppose, here at line number 4, we miss the curly brackets."""
Click on Save. Let us see what happens.
Come back to the terminal.
Let us compile as before.
We see an error:
Invalid initializer and Expected identifier or bracket before numeric constant.
This is because arrays must be initialized within curly brackets.
Come back to our program. Let us fix the error.
Type the curly brackets here at line number 4.
Lets us execute. Come back to the terminal.
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.
"""Yes, it is working."""
Now we will execute the same program in C++.
I will change a few things here.
"""First, press Shift , Ctrl and S keys  simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with the extension dot cpp (.cpp) and click on Save.
Let us change the  header file as iostream.
Now include the using statement.
The declaration and initialization of an array is same in C++.
Hence no need to change anything here.
Now replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
"""Delete the format specifier and backslash n (), now delete the comma and type two opening angle brackets."""
Delete the bracket here. Again type two opening angle brackets and within the double quotes type backslash n ().
Let us execute. Come back to a terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space array dot cpp space hyphen o space array1"""
Here we have array1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter array for the file array dot c.
"""To execute type, dot slash array1(./array1) . Press Enter."""
The output is displayed as: The sum is 15
We can see that it is similar to our C code.
"""Now, we will see another common error."""
"Suppose here, at line number 7, I will type star[1],  star[2] and  star[3]"
click on Save.Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
Let me clear the prompt.
Let us execute as before.
We get an unexpected output.
This is because array index starts from 0.
Come back to our program. We can see here the array index starts from one.
Hence it is giving an error. Let us fix the error.
Type 0 here 1 and 2. Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
Let us compile as before. Execute as before.
"""Now, we will go back to our slides."""
In this tutorial we learned:
"""Arrays , To declare Single Dimensional Arrays"""
To initialize Single Dimensional Arrays
"""example int star[3]={4, 5, 6}"""
"""To add the elements of the array, example sum is equal to star 0 plus star 1 plus star 2."""
"""As an assignment, write a program to calculate the difference of the elements stored in an array."""
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on sed - the stream editor.
"""In this tutorial,  we will learn usage of sed command."""
We will do through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial,"""
I am using Linux  Operating System and GNU BASH version 4.2.24
"Please note, GNU bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
"""As prerequisites,"""
you should know basics of Linux terminal.
"""For relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown: http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Let us start with an introduction to sed.
sed is a stream editor.
sed finds some pattern of text in a particular location of a file.
It performs some display or editing function-
"""editing functions like insertion, substitution and deletion in matched text."""
Let us start with some examples.
We will see how to print using the sed command.
I have a file called seddemo.txt in the home directory.
Let us view its contents.
"""In this file, we have some entries like- roll no, name, stream, marks, pass or fail and the stipend amount."""
"""Now suppose, we want to print the second line of the file."""
"""For this, we need to open the terminal."""
"""Now, type:sed space within  single quotes 2p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt"""
"""Here, 2 denotes the location which is the second line."""
'p' denotes the action which is printing.
Now look at the output.
It shows the entire file but see that the second line is printed twice.
This is the default behavior of action p.
"""To only print the second line,"""
type: sed space  -n space (within single quotes) 2p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
We see only the second line is printed.
-n stands for ‘silent mode’ which will suppress all unnecessary output.
Then we give the location in the stream that we want to edit or display.
We want to select the second line.
p indicates the action we want to take i.e. to print the second line
and seddemo.txt is the name of the file.
This is the general syntax of 'sed' command.
"""Now, let us print the last line of the file."""
Let me clear the prompt.
"""Now, type: sed space  -n space within single quotes dollar-sign p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt"""
We see that the last line is printed.
Now come back to text editor.
"""Suppose, we want to print the entries from 3rd to 6th."""
"""For this, we need to type on the terminal:"""
sed space  -n space within single quotes 3 comma 6p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
Press Enter.
The output is displayed from the third line to the sixth line.
Any of the actions can be reversed by using the exclamation mark (!) before the action.
"""Say, if we had to print all lines except from 3rd to 6th, we will type:sed space  -n space within single quotes 3 comma 6 (exclamation mark) !p"""
After the single quotes space seddemo.txt
The output is displayed.
Let us switch back to our slides.
Line addressing and context addressing.
"""So far, we specified the lines in the file on which the action needs to be taken."""
This is known as line addressing;
address specified by the line numbers.
This is one way of addressing.
Another way of addressing is Context addressing.
Lines that contain particular context say a particular word.
"""If we want to take actions on lines that contain a particular word, we use context addressing."""
Regular expressions can be used.
Let us see an example.
Come back to our text editor.
"""Say, we want to print those lines which have the word """"computers""""."""
Come back to our terminal.
"""Now, type:"""
sed space -n space within single-quotes front-slash opening square-bracket [cC] closing Square-bracket omputers/p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
Press Enter.
"""We see the lines with the word """"computers"""" is displayed."""
We write pattern within square-brackets.
This is to match any one or both of the characters within square-brackets.
"""When we need to match patterns, the pattern needs to be typed between front slashes."""
"""We can print it in a file as well using the w option. For this, type:"""
sed space -n space within single-quotes front-slash opening square-bracket [cC] closing square-bracket omputers/w space computer_student.txt after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
"""Now, all the matching lines would be transferred to the file computer_student.txt."""
Let us view the contents.
Type: cat space computer_student.txt
We see the entries.
We can also have patterns that we can write to different files.
Let us clear the prompt.
Type: sed space -n space -e space (within single quotes) (front slash) ‘/electronics/w space electro.txt’ after the single quotes space  -e space (within single quotes) (front slash) ‘/civil/w space civil.txt
"""Here, -e is used to combine multiple methods."""
This would create two files- electro.txt and civil.txt.
"""To see what they contain, type:"""
cat space electro.txt
"""This will display the entries with the word """"electronics""""."""
"""Let us see the content of """"civil"""" file."""
Type: cat space civil.txt
"""This will display the entries having the word """"civil""""."""
We will see some more set of commands in another tutorial.
I will use the same program.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Let us switch back to our slide.
"""we will  summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt: sed"""
To print using sed.Line Addressing.
Context Addressing.
"""As an assignment,"""
"""use the same text file """"seddemo.txt""""."""
Try to print records from 6th to 12th line.

Welcome to this tutorial on BLAST using Biopython tools.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn: To run """"BLAST"""" for the query sequence using Biopython tools"""
"""And, parse the BLAST output for further analysis."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics"""
and basic Python programming.
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: * Ubuntu Operating System version 14.10"""
Python version 2.7.8
Ipython interpretor version 2.3.0
Biopython version 1.64 and * a working Internet connection.
BLAST is the acronym for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.
It is an algorithm for comparing sequence information.
The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequences in databases  and calculates the statistical significance of matches.
There are two different ways to run BLAST:
Local BLAST on your machine or run BLAST over Internet through NCBI servers.
Running BLAST in Biopython has two steps.
"""First, run BLAST for your query sequence and get some output."""
"""Second, parse the BLAST output for further analysis."""
We will open the terminal and run BLAST for a nucleotide sequence.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""At the prompt, type: ipython and press Enter."""
"""In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to run BLAST over internet using NCBI BLAST service."""
Type the following at the prompt: from Bio.Blast Import NCBIWWW Press Enter.
"""Next, to run the BLAST over internet, type the following at the prompt.result= NCBIWWW.qblast(""""blastn"""",""""nt"""",""""186429"""")."""
We will use qblast function in the NCBIWWW module.
qblast function takes three arguments:
The first argument is the blast program to use for the search.
"""Second, specifies the databases to search against."""
The third argument is  your query sequence.
"""The input for the query sequence can be in the form of GI number or a FASTA file. Or, it can also be a sequence record object."""
"""For this demonstration, I am using the GI number for a nucleotide sequence."""
The GI number is for a nucleotide sequence of insulin.
The qblast function also takes a number of other option arguments.
These arguments are analogous to the different parameters you can set on the BLAST web page.
The qblast function will return the BLAST results in xml format.
Back to the terminal.
"""We have to use the appropriate Blast program,"""
depending on whether our query sequence is a nucleotide or protein sequence.
"""Since our query is a nucleotide, we will use blastn program and """"nt"""" refers to the nucleotide database."""
Details about this are available at the NCBI BLAST webpage.
"""The blast output is stored in the variable result, in the form of an xml file."""
"""Depending upon the speed of your Internet, it may take a few minutes to complete the BLAST search."""
It is important to save the xml file on the disk before processing further.
Type the following lines to save the xml file.
These lines of code will save the search result as blast.xml in the home folder.
Navigate to your home folder and locate the file.
Click on the file and check the contents of the file.
"""Use the code shown in this text file, if you want to use a FASTA file as a query."""
"""Here is the code, if you want to use sequence record object from a FASTA file as a query."""
Back to the terminal.
The next step is to parse the file to extract data.
The first step in parsing is to open the xml file for input.
Type the following at the prompt. Press Enter.
"""Next, import the module NCBIXML from """"Bio.Blast"""" package."""
Press Enter.
Type the following lines to parse the Blast output.
A BLAST record contains all the information you want to extract from the BLAST output.
Let us print out some information about all the hits in our blast report greater than a particular threshold.
Type the following code.
"""For a match to be significant, expect score should be less than 0.01."""
"""For each hsp, that is, high scoring pair, we get the title, length, hsp score, gaps and expect value."""
"""We will also print strings containing the query, the aligned database sequence and string specifying the match and mismatch positions."""
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
Observe the output.
"""For each alignment, we have length, score, gaps, evalue and strings."""
"""You can extract the required information using other functions, available in Bio.Blast package."""
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
"""Let's summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt to run BLAST for the query nucleotide sequence using GI number."""
"""And, parse the BLAST output using Bio.Blast.Record module."""
"""For the assignment, run BLAST Search for a protein sequence of your choice."""
Save the output file and parse the data contained in the file.
"""Your completed assignment should have the following lines of code, as shown in this  file."""
"""Observe the code. Since our query is protein sequence, we have used blastp program and """"nr"""", that is, non-redundant protein database for the BLAST search."""
Please download and watch it.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
"""Today, I would like to teach about selective sharpening."""
Every digital image out of the camera needs to be sharpened because they are not crisp specially if you take raw images and don’t allow the processor in the camera to sharpen the image.
"""But, when you do it yourself by using the GIMP you can control the sharpening. And in today’s tutorial, I will show you how to do it."""
"""Let’s have a look at this image, here."""
"""In this image, the wire mesh in the background is the bit unsharpened area and the flower here is a bit sharpened."""
"""So, I want to sharpen the flower a bit more and keep the background as it is."""
"""But, first I want to show you why I don’t want  to sharpen the background."""
It's unsharpened now and little bit of sharpening should not do any harm.
"""So, I select the Sharpen tool by clicking on the Filters in the tool bar and pull the Sharpness slider up and you can see that the originality of the background is destroyed."""
"""But, if you look here and I take the Sharpen tool here and when I pull the slider to the extreme value, the picture dissolves."""
"""So sharpening unsharpened areas or areas which are filled with color and no details, spoils the image. And this happens because the colours in the image which need no sharpening, get sharpened."""
"""So, I’ll tell you the method of selectively sharpening which does not destroy the image."""
"""To do selective sharpening, I will work with Layers."""
"""This time, I simply make a copy of the Background layer and call it sharpen."""
"""Now, I add a layer mask to the sharpen layer and I select the Grayscale copy of the layer as the layer mask and click on Add option and you see no change has happened because the Layer mode is Normal."""
"""But, when I de-select the original Background layer, you can see that only the bright parts in the image are visible."""
"""And if you remember, white in the layer mask reveals the bright parts and black hides and you can see here most of the layer mask is dark; so they are hidden and only the bright part here is visible."""
"""Now when I use the sharpening algorithm on the layer mask, only the flower will be sharpened."""
And I also want to sharpen the leaf part.
"""And in the sharpened image, I don’t want to have the white areas in the flower and I want only the fine details."""
"""To do that, I use the 2nd filter and this is Edge-Detect."""
"""This is the algorithm that helps for looking in the image, for the edges between bright and dull part and enhances them by making white line there."""
"""You can leave these options, here, as they are because there is not much difference between these algorithms. But I increase the value of Amount to 4 and look in the Preview."""
You can see here the background has a little bit of structure in it and in the brighter part there are thicker white lines.
I click on OK and wait for the algorithm to apply it to the image.
It works and now I get a white painting of all the edges.
"""I zoom into the image by pressing 1 and you can see here all the bright parts, now, have a white border and white line and all the other areas are nearly black."""
"""When I switch off the layer mask and  the Background layer, you can see only the edge of the flower i.e the brighter part is visible."""
Now I can sharpen the edge of the flower without affecting the colours in the background and the colour of the flower.
"""But, this would give a strange effect like a sharp line in a muddy background"""
And to avoid that I use another filter on this layer called Blur.
"""I select the layer mask and use Gaussian Blur to smash this white line a bit and I increase some value in Horizontal Blur Radius, say upto 8 and click on OK."""
Wait for the completion of the filter and now you can see that the edge of the flower is a bit more softer. And I think I need a bit more contrast in the image .
"""So, I select the Curves tool and click into the image to get the curve and I pull the curve a bit down to get the dark darker and pull the bright part up and get the white whiter."""
Click on OK and now I have thick white lines where there is a need for sharpening and black part where no sharpening should be done.
I could work on the black part but it will show no effect.
Now I disable the layer mask here and press Shift + Ctrl + E to look at the whole image.
Now you know Shift + Ctrl + E is to look at the whole image.
"""When I disable the original Background layer, I can see nearly nothing of the image."""
Let me explain you what’s happening there by adding a new layer with a White Layer Fill Type and press OK.
Now you see the areas that need to be sharpened.
Now let’s sharpen this image. I click on Filters in the tool bar and Enhance and select Sharpen.
Go to the area of the flower where sharpening is to be done and see to it the sharpen layer is selected because there is nothing to sharpen in the white layer.
"""So, select sharpen layer, then filter and Re-Show 'sharpen' and here you see the flower. And now I can pull the Sharpness slider up till I get a good sharpened image."""
And then press on OK and wait for the algorithm to work.
It works.
And now you can see that the line has more definition.
Let's switch this white layer off and see the full image.
Switch off the sharpen layer but no changes are visible in this magnification.
"""So, I zoom into the image."""
And I think you should see the effect properly.
"""When I on the sharpen layer, you see the sharpened image and when I off it, the image is not sharpened."""
"""With the help of the Opacity slider, I can control the amount of the effect."""
"""Now, I check the background and you can see I have not harmed it."""
Now I will do some fine tuning.
And I look in to the image for over-sharpened areas and the stuff which is not good enough sharpened.
The border between the flower and background is very well sharpened & with no add effects.
"""But when I go into the flower, this part looks a bit artificial and this part here is definitely over-sharpened."""
And this flower bud here is not sharp enough because the edge detect algorithm found no edges.
But as you can see there are some edges and I should have given this part a bit more boost with the help of the Levels tool or with the Curves tool.
Sharpening should always be the last step in your work flow.
Ok. I’ll come back to that later.
Now I have to reduce the sharpness of this part.
"""It’s easy, just make sure that you have selected the sharpen layer. Choose the Brush tool."""
Choose a brush with soft edges and make the brush large enough for this job by pulling the Scale slider and now select the black colour because you remember black hides & white reveals.
And pull the Opacity slider of your brush to say 20%.
"""When I move the brush here and start painting, you can see that the sharpening is reduced."""
I can show you exactly what happens here with the help of layer mask.
"""I ON the layer mask and when I paint over the white part, it turns darker."""
"""But when I turn off the layer mask, I can see the image and can see the result of my operation."""
I will look into the details later.
Now I have to do more sharpening to this part here.
I just switch the colours with ‘x’ key and start painting.
And as you can see this part gets sharper and darker.
And I think this is quite good and to check my work I switch on the layer mask and you can see the white part is what I have painted and I have done it a bit over.
"""So, I go back to the layer and change the colour by pressing 'X' key and redo the work I have done."""
We are working with the layers here; so there is no danger of losing any data.
The only thing that I can destroy now is the edge data that has been constructed by the filter.
But that can easily be redone .
"""Here, I have zoomed into the edge of the flower where the sharpening has to be done."""
"""And as you can see, the edge is sharpened here."""
"""The sharpening helps in getting a bright and dark line between the dark and the bright part of the border, between these 2 colours."""
The edge of dark part is darkened and bright part is brightened.
"""And by using the mask, you can keep the effect only to the area you want to have it."""
Let me point you to more detailed resource about sharpening.
"""Go to """"tips from the top floor.(dot)com""""- the site of Chris Markwa’s broadcast. And there on the left side, you will find somewhere a Photoshop Corner."""
"""And there he has lot of broadcast about Photoshop which nearly are usable for GIMP too. And he has made the effort as writing stuff he says in the broadcast and made some picture of it. And I’ll take some ma"
And here you can see about the sharpening effect about which I discussed in this tutorial.
He also covers the Unsharp mask and the process to avoid the halos in detail
and shows lot of different techniques to sharpen the image.
But the one I showed you is not here on this site.
"""And, by the way, when you are on this site just check out if there are still some places on learning to see workshop."""
"""This was it for this week. If you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org."""
More information is available at http://meetthegimp.org .
And I would like to hear from you.
"""Tell me what you liked, what I could have made better, what you want to see in the future."""
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project."""
The main motivation of this is to give you a head start about working with Linux.
The first command that we will see is the echo command. However note that Linux commands are 'case sensitive'.
Ctrl Alt t helps to start a terminal in Ubuntu.
This command may not work in all Unix systems however.
This prints the customary 'Hello World' message on the screen.
We can also use the 'echo' command to display the value of a variable.
We can also use escape sequences with 'echo' command.
For this in Linux we need to use the -e (hyphen e) option.
"""Common escape sequences include \t (backslash t) for tab,  for new line and \c is a escape sequence which when used causes the prompt to be displayed on the same line."""
This can be useful if say we want a prompt message before entering something.  Type at the prompt: echo space minus e within single quote  Enter a command back slash c (\c) and press Enter.
We will see that the prompt will be displayed after printing ‘Enter a command ‘ on the same line.
To know this and many other characteristics of our machine we have the uname command. Type at the prompt: uname space hyphen r and press Enter .
"""To know what is your username, type at the prompt: who space am space I and press Enter."""
This in fact comes from the who command that enlists all the users currently logged into the system in case your system is a multiuser system.
For this we have the passwd command. Type at the prompt: p-a-s-s-w-d and press Enter.
When you type this command you would be asked to type the current password.
Here I would be typing my system's current password.
But what if we have forgotten our current password?
"""Then also the password can be changed without knowing the current password, but that can only be done by the root user."""
Now who is a 'root user'?
He is a special person with extra privileges.
To draw an analogy we can say a 'root user' is similar to a user in Windows with Administrator status.
Type date in the terminal and press Enter
As we can see the date command gives both date and time. This is a very versatile utility and has many options as well.
Type at the prompt: date space plus 'percent' sign capital T and press Enter.
It gives us only the time in hours minutes and seconds (hh:mm:ss) format.
Type at the prompt: date space plus 'percentage sign small h and press Enter.
Type at the prompt: date space plus percentage sign small m and press Enter.
It gives the month of the year in numerical format. Here it is showing 02 for the month of February . Match this according to the output you are getting.
Type at the prompt: date space plus percentage sign small y and press Enter .
We can combine these options as well. For example type at the prompt: date space plus within double quotes percentage small h percentage small y and press Enter .
Here it is showing  February 11.
"""To see the calendar of any arbitrary month say December 2070, type at the prompt: cal space 12 space 2070 and press Enter."""
Before moving ahead let us discuss a little bit about files and directories.
In Linux almost everything is a file. Now the question is what is a file?
In real file a file is where we store our documents and papers. Similarly a Linux file is a container for storing information.
Next what is a directory?
When we login into the Linux system we are by default in a home directory. To see the home directory type at the prompt: echo space dollar HOME in capital and press Enter.
The next command helps us to see the directory we are currently working in. It is pwd that stands for 'present working directory'. Type at the prompt pwd and press Enter.
"""Once we know of our directory we would also want to know what are the files and sub-directories in that directory. For this, we have the ls command which is probably the most widely used command in Unix and"
"""ls is a very versatile command and has many options. Let us see some of them, type at the prompt: ls  space  minus minus all and press Enter."""
This shows all the files including the hidden files (hidden files here are filenames starting with dot (.))
If we not only want to see the file but also get more information we can use the 'minus l' option.
Just type the command: ls space minus small l and press Enter.
ls can be used with many options which we will see later.
Just type the command followed by the right angle bracket and the file name. Say we write ls space minus small l space right angle bracket space fileinfo and press Enter.
Now all the files and directories information will be directed into the file named 'fileinfo'.
"""But how do we see the content of this file? For this, we have the cat command. Just type cat space and the name of the file, here it is fileinfo and press Enter."""
"""Now you can see its contents. In fact, the other main use of cat is to create a file. For this, type at the prompt: cat space right angle bracket space filename say file1 and press Enter."""
Now when we press Enter the command waits for input from the user.
Whatever we type would be written into the file so type some text.
Now press Enter key to indicate the end of input.
Now press the Ctrl and D keys together.
If a file by name say 'file1' already exists then the user input will be overwritten on this file.
Now if you wish to append to the end of an existing file ‘file1’ type at the prompt: cat space double right angle bracket space file1 and press Enter.
"""There are several other commands that we could have discussed but we would keep it to this for now. In fact, even for all the commands discussed there are many options and possibilities untouched here."""
"""This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial. Spoken Tutorials are a part of the Talk to a Teacher project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Categories in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Course category, how to create categories & subcategories, how to perform actions on categories."""
"""To record this tutorial, I will be using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04, Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30, Moodle 3.3 and Firefox web browser."""
You can use any web browser of your choice.
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
Learners of this tutorial should have Moodle 3.3 installed on their system.
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and open your 'Moodle' homepage. Make sure that the XAMPP service is running.
Login with your admin username and password details.
"""On the left side, click on Site Administration."""
Click on the Courses tab and then Manage courses and categories.
We will be directed to a page with the title Course and category management. Let us understand what a course category is.
Course categories help to organize Moodle courses for the site users.
The default category for a new Moodle site is Miscellaneous.
"""Any new course will be assigned to this Miscellaneous category, by default."""
"""However, it will be difficult for teachers and students to find their courses."""
"""To make it easier to locate courses, they should be assigned in categories."""
Most institutions organize courses by campus or department.
It is good to have descriptive names for better clarity.
We will go ahead and organize our courses by departments. For eg. our Maths category will have all the Math courses.
Let us switch back to the Moodle site.
First we will understand the Course and category management page layout.
"""On the left, we have the Navigation block. And on the right, we have the Content region."""
"""The content region is divided into 2 columns: left column shows the course categories,  right column shows all the courses under the selected category."""
"""By default, it is showing courses under Miscellaneous category."""
This view can be changed from the menu located at the right.
Click on the down arrow to see the options.
Now click on Course categories. This changes the view to show only the course categories.
Let us click on the arrow again and change the view to see only the courses. Click on Courses.
Notice that a new drop-down box has appeared now. This is the category drop-down.
"""Here, we can select the category for which we want to show the courses. Currently, it only has the Miscellaneous category."""
Let us change the view back to Course categories and courses.
Now we will click on Create new category link to add a category.
Click on the Parent category dropdown box and select Top. Type: Mathematics in the Category name.
Category ID number is an optional field. This is for admin users to identify the course with offline courses.
"""If your college uses ID for categories, you can use that category ID here. This field is not visible to other Moodle users."""
"""For now, I will leave Category ID as blank."""
"""In the Description textbox, I will type- “All mathematics courses will be listed under this category.”"""
Then click on Create category button.
We are now in the Course categories and courses view.
Here we can see 2 categories now: Miscellaneous and Mathematics.
Let us organize these categories further.  Let us have separate 1st year Maths courses and 2nd year Maths courses.
"""For this, we will create a subcategory called 1st Year Maths, inside the Mathematics category."""
Click on Create new category link at the top of the listed categories.
Creation of the subcategory is same as that of a category.
Don’t select Top as the parent category.
"""Instead, select the category under which this subcategory should belong."""
"""So here, we will type: 1st Year Maths in the category name."""
"""After that, we’ll type a Description and click on Create category button."""
Notice that the categories on the left are listed in a tree format.
A category which has subcategories has a toggle icon to expand and collapse it.
Notice 3 icons on the right of the category.
Hover over the icons to see what they are.
The eye is for hiding the category.
A hidden category will have the eye crossed to indicate the same.
"""The arrow is for moving the category up or down. It also has a settings gear icon which is a menu, as shown by the down arrow."""
"""Click on the settings gear icon for Miscellaneous category.  It has options such as Edit, Create new subcategory, Delete etc. related to the category."""
Click elsewhere on the page to close this menu.
Let me collapse the navigation menu on the left for better view.
"""Next, click on the settings gear icon for Mathematics category."""
Notice that there are 4 extra submenus here related to sorting of the subcategories.
All categories that have subcategories will have these menu items.
The number to the right of the gear icon indicates the number of courses in that category.
There are sorting options below the list of categories.
"""At the end, is the option to change the parent category of a subcategory."""
"""To use this option, you have to check the check-box next to the subcategory you want to move."""
Then select the new parent category and click on Move.  We will not use this option right now.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: Course category, how to create categories & subcategories,  how to perform actions on categories."""
Here is an assignment for you: Add a new subcategory 2nd Year Maths under Mathematics. Delete the category Miscellaneous.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Setup in FrontAccounting.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn: FrontAccounting interface"""
Various modules in the Setup tab
"""Also, we will learn how to: Create our own organization or Company"""
Setup user accounts
Setup access permissions and Setup display
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04"""
FrontAccounting version 2.4.7
To follow this tutorial you should have Knowledge of higher secondary commerce and Knowledge of Accounting.
Start the XAMPP services before you begin working on FrontAccounting interface.
Let us open the FrontAccounting interface.
Open the browser and type localhost slash account and press Enter.
The login page appears.
"""Recall that during installation, we had created the admin user."""
Type the username as admin and password as spoken.
Then click on the Login button.
The FrontAccounting window opens.
Standard modules have been provided in FrontAccounting.
We will learn about Sales Purchases
Items and Inventory
Banking and General Ledger and Setup  modules in the upcoming tutorials.
Let us start with the Setup tab in FrontAccounting.
Click on the Setup tab. This module is used for Company Setting.
Let us create a new organisation or Company by clicking on the Company Setup link.
"""In the Name field, by default, we can see the name of the company - 'ST Company Pvt Ltd'."""
This is because we had given this name during installation.
"""However, you can change the name based on how you want it to appear in the reports."""
I will keep the same name. Scroll down.
"""In the Home currency field, click on the dropdown menu."""
A list of options will appear.
But Indian Rupees is not available in the list.
"""Since our company is in India, we will setup the home currency to Indian Rupees."""
Let us learn how to add a new currency to the list here.
Click on the Banking and General Ledger tab in the top menu.
"""In the Maintenance panel, click on Currencies link. A new window appears."""
Type 'INR' in the Currency Abbreviation field and 'Rs' in the Currency Symbol field.
"""In the Currency Name field, type 'Indian Rupees'."""
"""In the Hundredths Name field, type ‘Paise’ and in the Country field type 'India'."""
Now click on 'Add new' button at the bottom of the window.
We can see a success message- 'New currency has been added'.
"""Let us go back to the Company setup page. For this, click on the Setup tab in the top menu and then on Company Setup link."""
"""Next, type the Company’s address,"""
"""Domicile ,  Phone no, Email address and Company GST number in the respective fields as shown here."""
"""Now, click on the Home Currency drop-down box."""
Select ' Indian Rupees'.
Next we will learn about fiscal year.
"""By default the previous financial year, i,e 1st January to 31st December 2018 is shown as closed."""
"""At the time of recording this tutorial, the date is as shown on the screen."""
It may differ when you are practicing.
Note that the date format is in MMDDYYYY.
What is Fiscal year?
It is a period that a Company uses for accounting purposes and preparing financial statements. It varies across countries.
"""Fiscal Year setup When a new Company is created in FrontAccounting, the Fiscal Year has to be set up correctly."""
"""By default, FrontAccounting software shows the fiscal year from January to December"""
This is not suitable for Companies and organisations in India.
We have to set up the fiscal year from 1st April to 31st March for that financial year.
This is as per Indian Accounting Standards.
Let us switch back to the FrontAccounting interface.
Scroll down and click on the Update button to save the entries.
We can see a message- Company setup has been updated.
"""Now, we will change the Fiscal Year to the current Financial Year."""
Click on the Setup tab of FrontAccounting.
Click on the Fiscal Years link.
"""We can see that, by default the Fiscal Year begins from 01 January 2018 to 31 December 2018."""
"""So first, we will create a dummy period for 3 months from 01 January 2019 to 31 March 2019."""
Why dummy period?  This is because we have to fill the gap between the Fiscal year ie.1st January to 31st December and the Financial year which is from 1st April to 31st March
You may be in a different financial year when you are practising this tutorial.
"""In that case, you have to set up the fiscal year for all the previous years upto the current financial year."""
A sample is shown here for your understanding.
"""First, select the 3 months dummy period from 01 January 2019 to 31 March 2019."""
"""Now, click on the Add New button."""
We can see the dummy period is created.
A message appears - “New Fiscal year has been added”.
"""Then, we can see the current financial year is from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020."""
Keep the “Is closed” option to “No” as we will be using the current financial year for accounting purposes.
"""Again, click on the Add new button."""
"""Here, you can see the Financial Year has been created."""
We can see the fiscal year from 1st January 2018 to 31st December 2018 as closed.
We have created the dummy period from 1st January 2019 to 31st March 2019.
We will change the Is Closed option to Yes. Click on Edit icon.
"""In the Is Closed drop down menu, select Yes."""
Repeat the same steps to close all the previous financial years if they are not required.
Click on Update button.
A message appears - “Selected fiscal year has been updated”

Select the current Financial Year as 1st April 2019 to 31st March 2020 which is shown as active.
Scroll down and go to Login Timeout option.
We will increase to 6 lakh seconds so that frequent logout or timeout can be avoided.
Click on the Update button.
Next we will setup User Accounts.
Again click on the Setup tab.
Click on the User Accounts Setup link.
"""We can see the admin user login information such as Full Name  ,  Email ,  Access Level, etc."""
Recall this information was entered during the installation. Let us create a new user login.
"""I have typed the new user details as shown here. Likewise, enter your new user details."""
"""In Access Level field, click on the drop-down menu and select Sub Admin."""
"""In the Language field, by default, the drop-down menu option is English."""
"""Here, POS means Point of Sale. We will keep the Default option."""
"""In Printing option drop-down menu, keep the default option Browser printing support."""
"""Next, by default, the checkbox is checked for popup window for the reports option."""
Click on the Add new button. We can see the message- ‘A new user has been added’.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on  Servlet Methods.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:"""
create a simple login form using JSP
Pass parameters using doGet method
Pass parameters using doPost method
Difference between doGet and doPost methods.
Here we are using:Ubuntu Version 12.04
Firefox web-browser 21.0.
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know:"""
Core Java using Netbeans IDE
HTML
Basics of Java Servlets and JSPs.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website."""
We will begin by creating our web application- the Library Management System.
"""First, we will create the Home page."""
The Home page will contain a simple login form.
It will allow authenticated users to login to the Library Management System.
"""Now, let us switch to Netbeans IDE."""
Let us go to the index  dot jsp page that we had already modified earlier.
I have modified this page to create our home page.
We keep the title as Home Page.
"""Inside the body, we have a table with border equal to  1."""
You can have a look at the code here.
"""Inside the table, we have included a heading Welcome to Library Management System."""
"""Next, we have a paragraph tag that includes  """"This is the home page for Library Management System""""."""
Then we have a hyperlink which links to a page called visitorHomePage dot jsp.
We will create this page later.
"""Next, we have a very simple login form."""
This form allows a registered user to login .
"""Before creating the form , you will have to create a servlet named GreetingServlet."""
"""So, pause the tutorial here and create a new servlet as explained in the earlier tutorial."""
Note that the servlet name is GreetingServletand
the URL pattern should be GreetingServletPath.
This form has two input elements - Username and Password.
It also has a Submit button that says Sign In.
"""Next, we have a paragraph tag that includes a link to addUser.jsp."""
This is the registration page for those users who have not yet registered.
"""Now, let us go to our GreetingServlet.java."""
Note that GreetingServlet.java is created in the same package org.spokentutorial.
"""Now, this servlet will be able to access the form data from the request object."""
This servlet will act as a controller.
Do you recall that we had come across controller earlier?
"""Now, we will see what the servlet does as a controller."""
The form data will reside in the request object.
The first task is to retrieve the form data parameters.
This is done using the getParameter method on the request object.
"""So, let us switch to Netbeans IDE."""
Type inside the doGet method:
PrintWriter space out equal to response dot getWriter().
"""Next, we will retrieve the form data parameters."""
"""So that on the next line, type:"""
String space username equal to request  dot getParameter  within brackets and double quotes userName and semicolon.
Note that this userName is the name we have included in the form tag for User Name.
"""Similarly, we will retrieve the password also."""
"""So, on the next line, type: String  space password equal to request dot getParameter  within brackets and double quotes password semicolon."""
"""Next, we will print the UserName in the output."""
"""So, on the next line, type:"""
out dot println within brackets and double quotes  Hello from GET Method plus username.
"""Now, to run this project, right-click on MyFirstProject."""
Click on Clean and Build.
"""Again right-click on MyFirstProject ,  click on Run."""
"""So, the server is up and running."""
It has deployed MyFirstProject.
We have got our Home page displayed in the browser.
Observe that the title of the page is Home Page.
We can see a very simple login form here.
Let me enter the Username and Password.
I will type arya as the Username.
And arya*123 as the Password.
We can see that we have got the output Hello from GET Method arya.
"""Now, the user was able to login here because we have not included any validation inside the code."""
We will do this in the later tutorial.
"""Now, have a look at the URL here."""
It is localhost  colon 8080  slash MyFirstProject  slash  GreetingServletPath  question mark  userName  equal to  arya and password  equal to  arya *123.
"""Now, the form data is separated from the page information by a question mark."""
We can see that the username and password that we had entered in the form are inside the URL also.
"""Now let us try to do the same, using POST Method."""
"""So, switch back to the IDE."""
Copy the code we had written for  doGet method and paste in the doPost method.
"""Now, change the println statement to Hello from POST Method."""
"""Now, let us open index dot jsp."""
"""Here, we must change the method attribute of the form tag to POST."""
You can have a look at this code now.
We have form action  equal to  GreetingServletPath method  equal to  POST.
"""Now, we will run this Project again."""
"""So, right-click on MyFirstProject and click on Run."""
We have got the output similar to the one we got when we used the GET method.
"""So, let us type  UserName and Password again."""
Then click on Sign In.
Note that we have got Hello from POST Method arya.
"""Now, take a look at the URL."""
It is localhost colon 8080 slash MyFirstProject slash GreetingServlet Path.
"""Here, we do not see the form data in the URL of the request."""
This is the major difference between doGet and doPost methods.
"""Now, let us learn when to use GET and when to use POST methods."""
GET method is used when:
the form is small and hence the data is less.
the user wants the contents of the data to be visible in the URL.
POST method is used when:
the form is large and hence the data is more.
the user does not want the contents of the data to be visible in the URL.
ex: passwords
Let us summarize.
In this tutorial we have learnt to:
create a simple login form using JSP

"""Welcome to  Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""Here is the Foreground and Background Colour dialog, you can select the colours in 6 different ways."""
"""Here, I select black as my Foreground colour and you can see that the value of Hue, Saturation, Value, Red, Green, Blue all are zero."""
And when I increase the value of Hue nothing changes.
"""Black remains black because the value is zero and when I increase the value, I get  different gray tones."""
I can increase the Saturation while value is zero and nothing changes.
"""But you can see here that when I increase the Saturation, the colour in the other sliders changes a bit."""
"""If I pull the Hue, nothing happens  but when I pull Saturation, colour of Value changes to a kind of blue."""
If you want to select a colour by the 'HSV' system then just pull the Saturation and Value sliders up and you get different colours of the rainbow in the Hue slider and you can select from these colours.
"""Here you can see the colours in the Red, Green and Blue sliders change according to 'HSV' sliders and it becomes easy to select a colour."""
"""If you want a light colour then adjust the Saturation slider and if you want a good mixture of strong colours then slide the Value slider accordingly and select an amount in Red, Green or Blue slider."""
"""So Hue, Saturation and Value is not very easy to understand but a good way to select colours."""
I use this dialog only when I have to set a specific colour.
"""For example, if I want to have exactly medium gray then I pull the Value slider up to 50, so the value is divided between 0% & 100% and in the 'RGB' slider I set the numbers to 127  and you get exactly mediu"
"""Now, let's have a look at the other dialogs."""
This dialog is based on the 'HSV' colour model and first you select the colour in the circle which you want to have.
And then select the Value and the Saturation in the triangle.
"""So, when a Hue is selected, you get here the different values of  Value and Saturation in the triangle for the same Hue."""
The next dialog is similar to this one here.
"""In this dialog, you have a strip to select the Hue and you get the same colour as in the triangle in this square. And now you can select your colour here, from this area or you can change the Hue here and se"
Here you can also switch to Saturation.
"""And, select the combination of Value by sliding this way and Hue sliding this way."""
You can set the Value to get a strong colour here and change the Saturation and the Hue accordingly.
"""In the same manner, it works for Red, Green & Blue."""
I can change the amount of Blue in the colours I want to have and then the amount of Red and Green in the same way.
This dialog is not so innovative than the previous one.
The next dialog is a water colour mixup.
"""Here, this slider adjusts the intensity of tipping into the colour pots."""
And you can select a colour from this box.
"""And this, here, will be the resulting colour."""
"""You can select a colour, let's say this yellow and now I can add a bit of blue to this and a bit of red and the resulting colour you get is very muddy."""
I don't use this dialog very often.
This dialog shows the active pallet and you can set the pallet somewhere else.
It’s only useful for graphic designing and  for web designing. I really never have done much with this dialog.
"""One more thing is still to cover, it's the printer colours  here."""
"""I think this dialog is useful only for professional printers and printers use Cyan, Magenta and Yellow instead of Red, Green and Blue and that is because they substract the colours."""
"""The Red, Green and Blue mix up and add to white and with printing if I set Cyan, Magenta and Yellow to zero, simply the white paper is printed."""
"""If I want to print the black colour then I can set Cyan, Meganta & Yellow to 100 and I get fully black paper."""
"""These colours, these dyes substract from light, and reflect only Cyan."""
"""And by mixing them up, you can substract more and more from the light and you can get all the colours you can print."""
There are some visible colours that cannot be printed and so your result varies.
The fourth slider is K which represents black.
"""To avoid mismatch with blue, it is set as 'K' for Black."""
"""When I click the white colour which is my background colour, you can see nothing has changed."""
The colours are the same but the Cyan slider has gone down and the K slider has gone up.
Let's repeat that.
"""Slide  the Y slider to 40, M to 80 and C to 20."""
"""Now when I select the colour you get the M slider as 75, Y as 26 and K as 20."""
"""So you can see that the colour hasn’t changed but the mixture of cyan, magenta and yellow that was there before in the image has changed to magenta, yellow and black."""
"""Black ink is a bit cheaper. So, for the static point here, instead of the macky mixture of cyan, magenta and yellow, mixture of Magenta, Yellow and Black is used."""
"""So, now we have covered all the six dialogs of colour selection."""
"""But, these two colour swaps are remaining."""
"""The front colour is my foreground colour and the other one is my background colour and when I click on it, you can set the colour here."""
"""And, if you want these colours in your image or in your selection then just pull these colours over that area and it gets filled with that colour."""
You can have these colour swaps in the tool box.
"""Just go to File, Preferences and then Toolbox and here you can see foreground background colour and even the brush and the active image."""
I'll switch this off afterwards because it takes too much space in my tool box.
This small icon on right top corner of colour swaps is for exchanging the foreground and background colour.
The same can be done by pressing the 'X' key.
This icon on bottom left corner is for setting foreground and background colour to black and white.
This is a nice new feature. Its a colour picker and you can choose any colour you want from your screen or even  from a web site.
"""And, lastly there is a field where you can see the Hex code to define colours."""
"""And, when I change the colour you can see how the code changes and I can also type in the Hex code and get the colour or you can even type the colour name."""
"""For example, I type 'L' and you get all the colours lawn green, this is lawn green. So this was colour dialog in detail."""
I think I talked way too much.
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Welcome to the  tutorial on Arithmetic Operations in Java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn about the various Arithmetic Operators namely Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division and  How to use them."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have eclipse installed on your system"""
"""and you must know how to create, save and run a file in Eclipse."""
Here is a list of operators and the mathematical operations they perform plus (+) symbol for addition minus (-) for subtraction asterisk (*) for multiplication and slash (/) for division
We shall look at each of them in detail.
Here we have the 'Eclipse IDE' and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
We have created a class by name ArithmeticOperations and added the main method.
Let us add some variables.
int x = 5;
int y = 10; int result;
'x' and 'y' will be operands  and the  result will store the output of the operations.
Let us add them and print the result. result= x+y; system. out. println in parentheses result.
Save it with Control S and control F11 to Run.
We see that the output of the addition has been stored in result and the value has been printed.
"""Now Let us change the values. x=75, y = 15;"""
"""Save it, Run."""
we see that the output has changed  accordingly.
"""Now, let us try negative values. y = -25;"""
"""Save, Run."""
we see  that the output of  75  plus  -25 has been printed.
Now let us try subtraction. y = 5 and change x+y to x-y.
"""Save it, Run."""
we see that the output of 75-5 has been printed.
Now Let us try  multiplication. Change minus to asterisk (*).
Save and Run.
we see that  by using asterisk (*) we could  multiply 75 by 5.
Now let us try division. Remove  asterisk (*) and type slash.
"""As we can see, the output is as expected."""
Now let us see what happens when the expected result is a decimal point number.
Change 5 to 10
The result must be 7.5
"""So, let us change the result to a   float."""
"""Note that although the expected result is 7.5, we get output 7.0 ."""
This is because both the operands involved in the division are integers.
Let us change 'y' to a float. y = 10f;
"""Save, Run."""
Now we can see that the result is as expected.
"""Keep in mind that when the expected result is a float, one of the operands must be a float to get the expected output."""
Now let us see what happens when there is more than one operator. Remove all the operands.
"""int result= 8+4-2; Save it, Run."""
"""As we can see, the output is as expected."""
Now change minus to a slash.
Now the output could be 6 if the addition is done before division.
Or it could be 10 if the division is done before addition.
Let us Run and see the output.
"""As we can see, the output is 10 and   the division is done before addition. This is because the division operator has more precedence than the addition operator."""
"""In such situations, if we need to override the precedence, we use parentheses."""
"""By adding parentheses, we instruct Java to do the addition before the division."""
Let us run the file now.
"""As we can see, addition has been performed first and the output is 6, as expected."""
"""As a rule, keep in mind to use parentheses when the order of operations is not clear."""
This brings us  to the end of this tutorial.
We have learnt: How to perform basic mathematical operations in Java.
operator precedence and How to override it.
As an assignment for this tutorial: find out what is meant by the modulo operator and what it does.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Creating a Java web project.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
to create a Java Web Project
About Deployment Descriptor
About web.xml file.
Here we are using:Ubuntu version 12.04
Firefox web-browser 21.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of:"""
Core Java using Netbeans IDE and
HTML.
"""Now, let us see how to create a simple Java web project using NetBeans IDE."""
"""For this, we will switch to NetBeans IDE."""
"""On the top left corner of the IDE,  click on File and  click on New Project."""
A New Project window opens up.
"""From the Categories, choose Java Web and from the Projects choose Web Application."""
Then click on Next.
"""On the next window that opens,"""
type the Project Name as MyFirstProject.
Leave the Project location and Project Folder as it is.
"""Then, click on Next."""
Select GlassFish Server as the  Server.
"""Note that Context Path here is MyFirstProject,  this is the same name as our Project."""
We will learn about this in detail.
"""Now, click on Next and then click on Finish."""
Click on the  Projects tab.
"""We can see, there are several nodes here and a web application named My First Project has been created."""
"""Now, we are not concerned about all of these nodes right now."""
"""But let me click and show you, what it contains."""
"""Now, let us learn about what is known as  Deployment Descriptor."""
A web application’s deployment descriptor describes
"""the classes, resources and configuration of the application and"""
how the web server uses them to serve web requests.
The web server receives a request for the application.
It uses deployment descriptor to map the URL of the request.
It maps the URL to the code that has to handle the request.
The deployment descriptor is a file named web.xml.
"""Now, let us come back to the IDE."""
We are not able to find the web.xml file from the nodes available here.
"""To locate it, at the top left of the IDE, click on File and then click on New File."""
"""From the Categories, choose Web."""
"""And from the File Types,  choose  Standard Deployment Descriptor (web.xml)."""
Then click on Next
and click on Finish.
Click on the Files tab on the left hand  side of the IDE.
Note that web.xml is visible under the WEB-INF folder of the 'Web' node.
You can see the source-code now.
We have an xml header here.
We also have a web-app node.
"""Now, we shall try running the application."""
"""To do so, right click on MyFirstProject."""
This will delete any previously compiled files and other build outputs.
It will also recompile the application.
"""Again, right click on MyFirstProject and then click on Run."""
"""So, the server is up and running and it has deployed My first Project."""
A browser window opens up and displays  Hello World .
"""This is because when we run the project, the web application renders the page shown."""
"""Now, let’s have a look at the URL  here that rendered the page."""
It is localhost  colon 8080 slash MyFirstProject.
"""So, when we run MyFirstProject, by default we get a JSP page that says HelloWorld!"""
"""Now, let us come back to our IDE."""
"""We can see that under the WEB-INF folder, there is index.jsp."""
Double click on index.jsp.
We can see the source code here.
It is a simple JSP page with HTML tags only.
"""It has the title """"JSP Page"""" and it has the heading """"Hello World""""."""
The server provides index.jsp by default when we run the web application.
Recall that we had come across something called ContextPath earlier.
We had set the ContextPath as MyFirstProject itself.
"""Now, come back to the browser."""
Type the  URL  as localhost colon 8080 and press Enter.
We see the Home page of Glassfish Server is displayed.
"""Here, 8080 is the default port at which the server runs on the machine."""
This Glassfish Server instance may have many applications running on it.
"""To access a particular application, type that application-name in the URL."""
"""So, we must type the specific application that has been deployed on that instance."""

Warm greetings! Welcome to this tutorial on Stereoisomerism.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Conformational isomerism, Geometrical isomerism andR-S configurations with examples."""
"""Here, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS version. 14.04, Avogadro version 1.1.1."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with Avogadro interface. If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website."""
Example files used in this tutorial are provided as code files.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to build stereoisomers using Avogadro."""
I will give a brief introduction about stereoiosmersism.
Stereoisomersism arises due to difference in spatial arrangement of atoms.
Isomers have same structure and hence do not differ much in properties.
Here is a slide that shows classification of isomers.
I will begin with Conformational isomerism.
It is a form of stereoisomerism.
"""In this, isomers can be inter-converted by rotation about single bonds."""
Rotation about single bond is restricted by rotational energy barrier.
"""Let's begin with conformers of 1,2-dichloroethane."""
"""1,2-dichloroethane exists in three conformers namely: Eclipsed, Gauche and Anti."""
I have opened Avogadro window.
Click on Draw tool.
Uncheck Adjust Hydrogens check box.
Click on the panel and drag to draw two atoms.
Select Chlorine from Element drop down.
Draw a bond on each carbon.
Go to Build menu and click on Add Hydrogens.
"""1,2-dichloroethane is drawn on the Panel."""
Let's optimize the structure.
Click on Auto Optimization tool.
"""In the Force Field, select MMFF94 and click on Start button."""
Click on Stop to stop the optimization process.
Cick on Navigation tool to rotate the structure for proper orientation.
We have Gauche conformer on the panel.
"""To show conformers of 1,2-dichloroethane, I will fix the plane of rotation."""
Click on Bond Centric Manipulation tool.
Click on the bond between two carbon atoms.
Plane between the atoms appears in blue or yellow  color.
Place the cursor on Chlorine atom.
Rotate the bond in clock-wise direction.
Click on Navigation tool and rotate the structure.
We have  Anti conformer on the panel.
Again use Bondcentric Manipulation tool to rotate the C-C bond.
We have Eclipsed conformer on the Panel.
"""Now, I will show various conformers of Cyclohexane."""
Open a new window.
"""In Draw settings menu, Carbon is selected as default element."""
Uncheck Adjust Hydrogens check box.
Let's draw cyclohexane structure in the boat form.
Click and drag to draw boat conformer of cyclohexane on the Panel.
"""To label the atoms, click on Label check box in the Display Types menu."""
Please note labeling may not be same all the time.
Let us label the conformers as per our requirement.
"""Click on Selection tool, then right-click on first carbon atom."""
A menu opens. Select Change label.
Change label of the atom text box opens.
"""In the New Label field, type 1 and click OK."""
Next right-click on the second atom and change the label as 2.
"""Similarly, I will change the labels of atoms as 3, 4, 5 and 6."""
We will convert boat to twist boat conformer.
Click on Manipulation Tool. Click on 2 and drag it upwards.
Click on 5 and drag it upwards. Click on 3 and drag it upwards.
We have twist boat on the Panel.
"""Now, we will convert twist boat to half chair conformer."""
Click on 2 and drag it downwards.
Click on 5 and drag it downwards.
Click on 4 and drag it to horizontal position.
"""Adjust the positions of all carbon atoms if required, to get correct structure."""
We have half chair on the Panel.
Now we will convert half chair  to chair conformer.
Click on 4 and drag it downwards.
Click on 1 and drag it downwards.
"""Adjust the positions of all carbon atoms if required, to get correct structure."""
We have chair conformer on the Panel.
"""As an assignment,  draw various  conformers of Butane and Cyclopentane."""
Now I will draw structures to demonstrate geometrical isomerism.
Geometrical isomerism arises due to different spatial arrangement of atoms around a double-bond.
"""Here, rotation of atoms or groups around double-bonded carbon is restricted."""
"""For demonstration, I will draw  diamminedichloroplatinum(II) structure also known as cisplatin."""
Open a new window.
"""In Draw settings menu, click on Element drop down and select Other. Periodic table window opens."""
Select Platinum(Pt) from the table. Close the Periodic table window.
"""From Element drop down, select Chlorine."""
Draw two chlorine bonds on Platinum atom on the same side.
Select Nitrogen from Element drop down. Draw two nitrogen bonds as before.
"""To complete the structure, we need three attached hydrogens on nitrogen atoms."""
Select Hydrogen from Element drop down.
Click on each nitrogen atom to draw the third bond.
Let's optimize the structure.
Click on Auto Optimization tool.
"""In the Force Field, select UFF and click on Start button."""
Click on Stop to stop the optimization process.
"""For demonstration, I will require two structures."""
I will copy and paste the structures.
Click on Selection tool to select the structure.
Press CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste. Drag the pasted structure to right.
"""For convenience, I will label the atoms."""
Click on Label check box in the Display Types menu.
"""To remove Hydrogens, go to Build menu and select Remove Hydrogens."""
We have two isomers of cisplatin on the Panel.
I will convert the second cis isomer to trans isomer.
Click on Manipulation tool.
Click and drag Cl4 to  left. Click and drag N4 to right.
Then adjust the postions of all the bonds to show proper orientation.
Go to Build menu and select Add Hydrogens.
"""As before, each nitrogen has two atoms attached."""
Add the third Hydrogen using Hydrogen from Draw tool.
Let's optimize the structures.
"""In the Force Field, select UFF and click on Start button."""
Click on Stop to stop the optimization process.
We now have two geometrical isomers of diamminedichloroplatinum(II) on the Panel.
"""Similarly, we have the geometrical isomers of diamminetetracyanoferrate(III)ion [Fe(NH3</sub)2(CN)4]-."""
Next we will discuss about  R-S configuration.
R-S configurations arise due to the presence of a Chiral centre.
Chiral centre is an atom connected to four different substituents.
Configurations are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.
"""For demonstration of  R-S configurations, I will use amino acid - Alanine."""
I will load Alanine structure from Fragment library.
All the amino acids available in the Fragment library are optically active.
You can load and explore on your own.
Press CTRL+SHIFT and A to deselect the structure.
"""Using the Navigation tool, rotate the structure for proper orientation."""
"""Central carbon atom is chiral, attached to 4 different groups."""
R S configuration is based on priority given to the substituent in clockwise or anticlockwise direction.
Priority is based on atomic number of the substituent.
Substituent with higher atomic number gets first priority.
Now we see the priority in clockwise direction.
"""In this structure, nitrogen is given first priority."""
Carbon attached with oxygens is given second priority. And methyl is given third priority.
Structure has R configuration.
I will change the positions of the attached groups to the chiral carbon.
Go to Build menu and select Remove Hydrogens.
Move carbon to right side.
Move carbon attached to oxygens to left.
Go to Build menu and select Add Hydrogens.
Now we will see the priority in anti-clockwise direction.
Nitrogen has first priority. Carbon attached with oxygen is given second priority. And Methyl is given third priority.
Structure has S configuration.
"""Similarly, we have R and S configurations of Glyceraldehyde on the Panel."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt to draw: Conformations of 1,2-dichloroethane, Conformations of cyclohexane, Geometrical isomers of cisplatin, R-S configurations of amino acid Alanine."""
"""As an assignment, draw Geometrical isomers of 2-butene and 1,2-dichloroethene,  R-S configurations of bromochloroiodomethane."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Enroll students and communicate in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to: Enroll students who were uploaded via a csv file to a course,"""
Make groups in courses and Send messages and notes to the students.
"""This tutorial is recorded using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04,"""
Moodle 3.3  and  Firefox web browser. You may use any web browser of your choice.
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
This tutorial assumes that: your site administrator has registered you as a teacher and assigned at least one course to you.
"""It also assumes that you have added some course material, assignments and quizzes for your course."""
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
"""Before we begin, please ask your Moodle site administrator to add 5 or 6 users to your Moodle site."""
You will be adding these new users to your course later. So ensure that new users are added to your Moodle site.
Teachers in Moodle cannot add new users to the system. They can only enroll users that are already added by the site administrator.
Switch to the browser and login to your Moodle site as a teacher.
Click on the Calculus course in the left navigation menu.
Click on the gear icon at the top right and then on More....
We are on the Course Administration page.
Click on the Users tab.
Click on Enrolled users link within the Users section.
There are 2 users enrolled to this course - Rebecca Raymond and Priya Sinha.
Rebecca Raymond has teacher role and Priya Sinha has student role.
"""Now, click on the Enrol users button at the bottom right."""
This list has students that I want to enroll to my Calculus course.
Select Student in the Assign Roles dropdown.
Then click on the Enrol button next to the users that you want to enroll.
I will enroll a few students in my course right now.
"""Once done, click on the Finish enrolling users button at the bottom right."""
We can see the number of enrolled users for the Calculus course at the top of the page.
"""Next, let us learn how to make some groups in the course."""
These groups will help us assign students for group activities.
I will make 2 groups - Explorers and Creators.
Click on Calculus in the breadcrumb to go back to the course page.
And go to the Course Administrator page again.
Click on Groups link in the Users tab.
Scroll down and click on Create group button.
Type Explorers as the Group name.
There are no other mandatory fields.
Scroll down and click on Save changes button.
"""Notice that Explorers can now be seen on the left side, in the list of groups."""
"""The number zero next to it indicates that there are no users in that group yet. Select Explorers, if not already selected."""
Then click on Add/remove users button at the bottom right.
I will select Susmitha and Sai from the list of students.
And then click on Add button in the middle of the 2 columns.
"""On the left, observe the list of users in the group Explorers."""
"""On the right, observe the list of all other students enrolled in this course."""
"""They can be added to this group as and when required, by the teacher."""
"""Add and Remove buttons between the 2 lists, get enabled when we select users from the lists."""
Click on Back to groups button at the bottom of the page.
Pause this tutorial and do this small assignment. Add a new group called Creators
Assign 2 new users to that group Resume the tutorial when done.
Now you should be able to see a screen like this.
"""Notice the columns Roles, Groups and Enrolment Methods have icons."""
Move your mouse over each of the icons to understand their functions.
Note that: An enrolled student can belong to more than one group as well.
Let us now see how we can send a message to the students.
Click on Participants link in the left navigation bar.
This will show the list of all enrolled users with their assigned roles in the course.
"""By default, Moodle Participants page displays only 20 students."""
You will need to click on Show all if you have more than 20 students to see all the students. The link is not visible right now because I don’t have more than 20 students.
There are some filters seen above the list of users. Use them to help select the right set of users.
I will select Student in the Current role dropdown.
This will filter the list to show only the users who have student role assigned to them.
Click on Select all button at the bottom of the page to select all the students.
Then select Send a message in With selected users dropdown.
This will send a common message to all the selected students.
Pause the tutorial and type the message as shown here in the Message body.
"""Then at the bottom, click on the Preview button, to preview the message before sending."""
"""You can also update the message, if required, by clicking on the Update button."""
"""To send the message, click on the Send message button."""
You will see a confirmation message and a link to go to back to the participants lists.
Click on Back to participants list.
Click on With selected users dropdown. Notice the options to send notes; both private and common.
Let’s select any 2 users.
Select Add a new note from the With selected users dropdown.
"""In the Content text area of one user, I will type the note as shown."""
"""In the Content text area next to another user, I will type the note as shown here."""
Look at the Context dropdown to the right.
The Context of a note determines which users can see the note.
A personal note will be seen only by the teacher and the student being sent to.
A course note will be visible to the other teachers of this course.
A site note will be visible to all teachers in all courses.
Most institutions have their own rules regarding communication between teachers and students.
You can decide the Context based on these guidelines.
I will let the Context be course.
Click on Save changes button when done.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt how to: Enroll users in a course"""
Make groups in a course and Send messages and notes to students.
"""Here is a small assignment for you. Enroll all the users that were created by the Moodle site admin earlier, to the Calculus course."""
Add new students to the existing groups and send them a welcome message. Then send notes to the students.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Banking and General Ledger in Front Accounting.
"""In this tutorial,we will learn to create General Ledger Classes"""
General Ledger Groups  and General Ledger Accounts
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04"""
FrontAccounting version 2.4.7
"""To practise this tutorial, you must have knowledge of: Higher secondary commerce and accounting ,  Principles of Bookkeeping"""
And you should have already set up an organisation or Company in FrontAccounting.
"""If not, for relevant FrontAccounting tutorials please visit this website."""
Start the XAMPP services before you begin working on FrontAccounting interface.
Let us open the FrontAccounting interface.
Open the browser and type localhost slash account and press Enter.
The login page appears.
Type the username as admin and the password. Then click on Login button.
The FrontAccounting interface opens.
Click on Banking and General Ledger tab.
In the Maintenance panel we can see the options: GL Accounts
GL Account Groups and GL Account Classes
"""Before we start with any transaction, we need to set the Charts of Accounts."""
"""The Charts of Accounts in FrontAccounting is defined by Type, Class, Group and Account."""
"""All transactions are charged to an Account, Group and Classes."""
These are used to group transactions for reporting purposes.
"""In FrontAccounting, Account belongs to a Group and Group belongs to a Class"""
It will be reflected in the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss account statements as per the Account Group.
Switch back to the FrontAccounting interface.
The first step is to set the General Ledger Account Classes.
Click on GL Account Classes link in the Maintenance panel.
"""Here, by default the Class Name and Class Type are defined as: Assets ,  Liabilities ,  Income and Expense"""
"""Also, we can see that the Class ID is set for each Class Type."""
We need to set this class before setting the Account Group.
Now we will see how to add a new class.
"""In the Class ID field, type 5. The Class ID should be a unique value."""
"""In the Class Name field, type Equity."""
"""Click on the Class Type drop-down box. We can see the default list: Assets ,  Liabilities, Equity, Income, Cost of Goods Sold and  Expense"""
FrontAccounting follows this Class Type to present in the Balance Sheet.
Select the Class Type as Equity.
Click on Add new button at the bottom of the window.
A message is displayed- 'New account class has been added'.
"""Here, we can see that the new Class “Equity” has been added to the third row."""
"""This is because, in the default Class Type, Equity is on the third hierarchy level."""
"""So, whenever a new Class is added, it takes the default place of that Class Type."""
"""Now, let us see how to add GL Groups."""
Go to the Banking and General Ledger tab.
Click on the GL Account Groups link in the Maintenance panel.
"""We can see the default Group Name, which shows GL Account Groups under the Class."""
You can also see the Group ID is set according to the Class.
"""In the ID field, type the new Group ID as 12."""
"""In the Name field, I will type Fixed Assets as the Group Name."""
The Group Name “Fixed Assets” does not belong to any subgroup that is already available.
"""Hence, in the Subgroup field, keep the field as None."""
"""Now, click on the Class drop-down box."""
"""According to the Charts of Accounts, Fixed Assets comes under the class of Assets. So select Class as Assets."""
"""To save these changes, click on Add new button at the bottom of the window."""
"""We can see an error message that says - """"This account Group ID is already in use""""."""
So a unique Class ID has to be added to each Group Name.
Let’s change the Group ID to 13.
Click on the Add new button at the bottom of the window.
"""This time we can see a message that says - """"New account type has been added."""""""
The new Group Name is added randomly within the class “Assets”.
"""Likewise, we can add our own Group Name."""
"""Now, let us see how to add GL Accounts."""
Click on the Banking and General Ledger tab.
Then click on GL Accounts link in the Maintenance panel.
Here also we need to type a unique code. It is a mandatory field.
"""In the Account Code field, I will type 1100 as the code."""
"""You can give any code of your choice, if you wish to."""
"""Click on the Account Name field. Type the Account Name as """"Land and Building""""."""
You can give any name of your choice.
"""In the Account Group drop-down box, select the Account Group as Fixed Assets."""
The Account Name Land and Building has to come under the Group Fixed Assets as per the Charts of Accounts.
"""Next, click on the Account status drop down menu. Select the status as Active."""
Then click on Add Account button at the bottom of the window.
"""We can see the message - """"New account has been added""""."""
"""Now, click on the New account drop-down box at the top. We can see the newly added Account here."""
"""Each organisation will have their own set of account codes, as shown here."""
"""Likewise, by following the above steps, you can create your own GL Accounts."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize
"""In this tutorial, We have learnt to create General Ledger Classes   ,  General Ledger Groups   and  General Ledger Accounts"""
As an assignment. Create new GL Accounts - Cash and Capital with the below details .  Save the changes
Now we have set the Charts of Accounts for our Company with new GL Accounts.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Issuing and returning a book.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how:"""
To fetch all the user details
To issue a book
To return a book.
Here we are using:
Ubuntu Version 12.04
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of:"""
Basics of Java Servlets and JSPs
Creating and viewing inventories.
"""In the earlier tutorial, we had seen how the Admin Section works."""
"""Here, in this tutorial, we have added more functionality to the Admin Section."""
"""So, let us switch to the browser."""
Let us login again as the admin.
We can see that we have two more options in the Admin Section Page - List Users and Checkout/Return Book.
"""Now, let us come to the IDE."""
We can see that in the adminsection.jsp there are two more radio buttons.
One for List Users and the other for Checkout/Return Book.
"""Now, switch back to the browser."""
We will click on the radio button for List Users.
"""It has all the details like First Name, Surname, Age, Gender and Username."""
The steps are similar to the earlier two options;
we saw them in the previous tutorial.
"""Now, let us click on the next option which is to Checkout or Return Book."""
We get a form which allows you to checkout as well as return book.
We will now see the code for the same.
Switch back to the IDE.
We clicked on Checkout/Return Book.
So menuSelection is equal to checkoutbook.
The steps are the same that we saw for List Books.
"""But here, we forward the request to checkOut.jsp using RequestDispatcher."""
"""Now, let us come to checkOut  dot jsp."""
This page is similar to that of listBooks dot jsp
except that we have a radio button against each book
so that we can Checkout/Return  that book.
We also have a User name field to get the username of the user who has to checkout the book.
We also have a Date field to set the return date of the book.
We have set the return date as one week from current date.
This is done using the class Calendar.
The add() function of this class takes two parameters.
The first is the present day of the year.
Second is the number of days to be added to the present day.
We have added seven days.
"""Now, note that  form action is equal to CheckOutServlet."""
"""Now, let us come back to the browser."""
We will  click on Book Id 1.
Type the username as arya.
We see that the return date is one week from today’s date.
Note that the number of Available Copies is 9.
Click on Checkout book.
We get the Checkout Success Page.
We will click on here to come  to the Admin Section Page.
Again click on Checkout/Return Book.
We can see that the number of Available Copies reduces to 8.
We will see the code for this now.
Come back to the IDE.
Go to CheckOutServlet.java.
We have set the errorMsgs list.
We have set the errorMsgs in the request.
We get the username from the request using getParameter.
"""Similarly, we get  checkout_book, return_book and book-id."""
"""Next, we parse the book_id as Integer from the id."""
We validate the userName and book id.
We also validate if Checkout_book and Return_Book are null.
"""Then, we validate if either of them is not null."""
"""Here, we check if the user exists in the system using userExists method."""
We then store the returned value of the method in userExists variable.
"""Now, we will see what we do in this method."""
"""Here, first we execute the query to check if the username exists in the table."""
Then we initialize the integer variable userExists to 0.
If the username exists then we set userExists to 1.
We then return the value of userExists.
"""So, if the method returns 0 then it means the user does not exist in the system."""
"""else, if user exists then we call  'bookAlreadyIssued' method."""
We then store the returned value of the method in bookIssued.
"""Here, we check if the same book has already been issued by the same user."""
"""Now, let us come to bookAlreadyIssued method."""
"""Here, we have set an integer variable bookAlreadyIssued to 0."""
We execute the query to check if a book with the same book_id is issued by the same user.
We get the book_id from Checkout table.
If BookId exists then set the variable bookAlreadyIssued to 1.
We then return the value of bookAlreadyIssued.
"""So, if the method returns 1 then it means the same user has already borrowed this book."""
"""Now, come back to the browser."""
"""Now, let us try to checkout the same book by the same user."""
Type the username as arya.
Click on the radio button against Book Id 1.
Then click on Checkout book.
"""We see that we get theerror message that """"The same user has already borrowed this book""""."""
"""Now, switch back to the IDE."""
"""If userExists in the system and if the checkout_book is not null, we call checkout method."""
Let us see what we do in this method.
"""Here, we get the availablecopies for the corresponding id."""
We get this from  Books table.
We then store the number of availablecopies into the variable availableCopies.
We check if availableCopies is greater than 0 and bookIssued  is equal to 0.
We get the dateofreturn from the request and store it in  returndate.
We then call  insertIntoCheckout.
We will see what we do in insertIntoCheckout method.
"""Here, we store the book_id, userName and returndate into the Checkout table."""
Then we call decrementAvailableCopies method.
We will see what we do in this method.
"""Here, we execute the query to decrement the Available Copies in the Books table by 1."""
Then we call the setCheckoutIntoRequest method.
Let us come to this method.
"""In this method, we set the checkout attribute into the request."""
Then we forward the request to successCheckout.jsp using RequestDispatcher.
"""If availableCopies is 0 then we print  """"There are no copies of the requested book available""""."""
"""Now, let us come to successCheckout  dot jsp."""
"""Here, first we get the checkout attribute from the request."""
We then display the success message for successful Checkout.
You can try out the different errors by yourself.
"""Now, let us return the book.  So, switch to the browser."""
"""Click on Book Id 1 and type the username as """"arya""""."""
"""Then, click on Return book."""
We get the success message that book has been successfully returned.
Click on here for another checkout/return.
"""So, we come back to  Admin Section Page."""
Click on Checkout/Return Book.
We can see that the number of Available Copies has been incremented.
We will see the code for this.
Come back to the IDE.
Open CheckOutServlet  dot  java.
We check if userExists  is equal to 1  AND return_book  is not equal to null.
Then we call returnBook method.
Let us come to this method.
"""Here, we select the totalcopies and availablecopies from Books table for the Book Id."""
We store the Total Copies and Available Copies to totcopies and availcopies.
Then we check if available copies exceed the total Copies.
"""Now, let us come back to the browser."""
Let us now return a book for a user who has not borrowed the book.
Type the User name as mdhusein.
Click on  Book Id 1.
Then click on Return book.
"""We can see that we get the error message: """"The given user has not borrowed this book!!"""""""
"""Now, come back to the IDE."""
"""Here, we check if  bookIssued is equal to 1."""
We then call  removeFromCheckout method.
Let us come to this method.
"""Here, we execute the query to delete from Checkout table the entry which has returned the book."""
"""Then, we call  incrementAvailableCopies method."""
Let us come to this method.
"""Here, we increment the Available Copies by 1."""
We execute the query to update in the Books table.
Then we call the setReturnIntoRequest method.
Let us come to this method.
"""Here, we set the returnBook attribute into the request."""
Then we forward to  successReturn page using  RequestDispatcher.
The successReturn page is similar to that we had for successCheckout page.
"""Now, come back to the browser. Come back to the login page."""
We can see that we have a link called Visitor’s Home Page.
We can see that we get a list of all the books available.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Design a Visiting card using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
Settings for a visiting card
Designing a visiting card
Settings to print multiple copies of the visiting card
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS Inkscape version 0.48.4"""
Let us open Inkscape.
Go to File. Click on Document properties.
Change the Default units to Inches and the default Orientation to Landscape.
Let us now start designing the visiting card.
"""So, draw a rectangle using the Rectangle tool."""
Click on the Selector tool.
"""On the Tool controls bar, change the Width to 3.5 and Height to 2."""
Move it to the top left corner of the canvas.
Change the color to dark green.
Let us design a pattern now.
Select the Bezier tool and draw a wavy line.
Go to Object menu. Open Fill and Stroke.
Change the stroke color to yellow.
"""Now, draw a straight line below the wavy line."""
Select both the lines. Go to Extensions menu.
Click on Generate from path and then on Interpolate.
Check if the Exponent value is 0.
Change the Interpolation steps value to 30.
Click on Apply button and then on Close button.
Notice the Interpolation effect is now applied.
Let us give some glow effect to the Interpolate design. Select the design.
Go to Filters menu. Click on Shadows and Glows and then on Glow.
Observe the glow effect is applied to the design.
Let us import the Spoken Tutorial logo now.
I have saved it in my Documents folder.
The logo has been given to you in the Code files link.
Go to File and click on Import.
Resize the logo and keep it on the top left corner.
Let me copy the visiting card details from a LibreOffice Writer file that I had saved already.
This file has been given to you in the Codes files link.
Change the Font size to 12 and the text color to white.
Select the Spoken Tutorial word.
Change the font size to 16 and make it bold.
"""Now, our visiting card for Spoken Tutorial is ready."""
"""Next, we will learn to create multiple copies of the visiting card."""
We can do this by cloning method.
"""For doing that, we should first group all the elements."""
Press Ctrl + A to select all the elements and Ctrl + G to group them.
"""Now, go to the Edit menu."""
Click on Clone and then on Create Tiled Clones.
The Create Tiled Clones dialog box opens up.
"""Under the Symmetry tab, change the number of rows to 4 and columns to 3."""
"""Now, click on Create button."""
And then close the dialog box.
Notice that multiple copies of the visiting card appear in the canvas.
"""In this way, we can print multiple copies of the visiting card."""
Turn your attention to the visiting card at the top left.
Click on it and move it from its position.
Now delete this card as it is an extra copy.
What if there are some changes to be incorporated?
Will we have to change each and every copy of the visiting card?
Not at all. We will have to make the correction only in the original visiting card.
The same will be reflected in the copies.
Let's try this. Double-click and change the color of the word Spoken Tutorial to brown on the original card.
Observe the changes are reflected in all the visiting card copies.
"""Now, let us save the file."""
Press Ctrl + S to save the SVG file. I will choose Desktop as the location to save my file.
And I will type ST-visiting-card as the Filename and click on Save.
"""After this, we will save the file in PDF format."""
"""Once again, go to File and click on Save As."""
Change the extension to PDF and click on Save.
Change the resolution to 300 and click on OK.
Let us go to the Desktop.
Here is the file that we had saved. Let's open it.
Here are the visiting cards that we created.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: Settings for a visiting card Designing a visiting card Settings to print multiple copies of the visiting card."""

"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
I have got this image with an e-mail from Norman.
He asked to save it.
This is the image he has got after using RAW convertor and this here was the original image.
"""Comparing the images, it was clear what Norman has done."""
First he has rotated the image and then he has edited the image with the curves tool to get the colors and brightness in the foreground right and tried not to darken the clouds.
"""When you look at this image here, the clouds are simply gorgeous."""
"""I love them and I have asked him for permission to show this image on the show and I will try to re-do his work now and then I will try to get the clouds better, in his image."""
"""But, first let’s see if we find something in EXIF information about this image which gives clue to what went wrong ."""
"""You can see that it’s a Panasonic camera, and this camera has very tiny sensor."""
You can put this camera in your shirt pocket.
And here we have the exposure data.
One  thousand of a second Exposure Time and Aperture is 5.6.
The flash was on and the camera calculated the effect of the flash into the image.
And the flash of such  tiny camera does not work with such a scene.
"""I think, you would need something like a small nuclear bomb behind you for brightening up this part of the image."""
This image is saved in JPEG and that gives another problem.
"""This area here which is the really interesting part in this image, has become very dark because of JPEG compression."""
"""And when I zoom into the horizon, I can see a well defined stuff but a bit over-sharpened and there is also a ship on the horizon."""
"""The clouds are very detailed but when we go into the dark part, you see a tree here but nothing is clearly visible."""
This is because JPEG leaves parts out of the image which computer program in the camera doesn’t think you will ever see.
But I want to see this stuff here and I am a bit stuck with the JPEG compression because the details which are lost here will never be visible again.
"""And when you shoot this raw, you avoid such problems and in next tutorial I will show you the UF raw converter and how to use it with the gimp and I think that will be the right topic for the next tutorial."""
I load the image into the GIMP by just pulling it over to the toolbox here and enlarge the window.
"""Now, my first step will be sizing this image a bit because the image is so large that the resulting ‘XCF’ file will be more than 40 mega bytes."""
"""Sizing down can be done by clicking on Image in the tool bar, selecting Scale Image and I change the Width to say 1000 pixel and when I press Tab, I get the Height as 750 pixels and I have the best Interpola"
Press shift + Ctrl+ E to get the image full into the frame here and now I am set for editing this image.
The first step will be rotating.
"""In previous tutorials, I have shown you two ways to rotate an image and today it’s time for third way."""
"""So, I follow the same step of zooming into the image where I can see a horizontal line and the horizontal line is on the horizon because horizon by definition is horizontal."""
"""Then I select the measurement tool from the toolbox and I don’t select the info. window because it pops up in between the image frame. But I can get all the information here, below, in the status bar."""
"""Now, getting the angle of horizon is simple. Just put cursor on the horizon, press the mouse button and pull it."""
Pull the line to the other side and make a line parallel to the horizon and release the button.
Look for the angle info. in the status bar and I see here the angle is 1.64°.
"""Now I select the Rotate tool, just click into the image and type in -1.63°(degrees), minus because I want to counter the plus 1.63 °(degrees)."""
Click on Rotate and you get a rotated image.
"""Just to test the horizon, we pull down the scale and it is horizontal."""
The next step will be cropping the image. But I can’t crop the image now because this part of the image is not visible. So I really can’t judge the stuff.
"""I don’t know where to crop, so first make this part of the image a bit brighter."""
I want to work with the Curves tool but before that I make a copy of the layer.
"""Because, when we use curves tool ,information in the image is lost."""
"""So, never do something with an image which you can’t take back."""
"""Well, I did rotate it but in later steps never do anything on original image."""
"""First, I will edit the land portion; so I call this layer Land. And double click into the field where the name exists and press return."""
Now the layer is named Land.
"""I select the Curves tool, click into the image and now I will explore the image."""
"""This part of the image is really the darkest part, one can make it out easily but the grass here is also very dark."""
The water seems to be this part of the gray scale here and the sky is obviously this part.
"""So, I have to brighten the land in the image and I just do it by pulling this up."""
"""Now, the question which comes to mind is how far should I pull it because when I go too far it will look artificial."""
"""And if I want to combine the sky and the land with big differences in the curves, it will not look like a real image."""
"""So, I pull this down a bit."""
Let me try this.
This looks good here.
The sea is not too bright and the chapel is also visible.
"""So, I click on OK."""
"""After I have edited the land part, let me go to the sky."""
"""So, again make a copy of the original layer and just move it on the top and name it Sky."""
"""Double click on the layer, type the name as Sky, pressing return and we have the Sky."""
"""I want to edit only the Sky layer without harming other layers and to do that, I work with a layer mask."""
"""Right click on Sky layer, click on Add Layer Mask and select White layer mask i.e full opacity. That means, this layer is fully visible and it is white."""
I want to hide the land layer and I also don’t want sharp edge between sea and sky and for that I use the gradient tool.
A gradient is simply a thing between black and white.
Let me show you this in a scrap layer here.
"""I have selected the Gradient tool and this is the new thing I have just found out by accident that when you double click on the tool icon, the tool options are automatically selected."""
I don’t think it’s a new thing for you but it’s new for me.
Good thing to know.
"""Going back to the Gradient tool: when I pull this line here by clicking the left mouse button and release it,"""
the area to the left of the starting point is filled with black and the area on right of the end point is filled with white which is the other side of the gradient.
And the area between white and black is the different series of grays and it is called gradient.
And I can make long gradient or very short gradient
"""Here are the different gradient tools and I will stick to this one here, black and white."""
And there are lot more options here like Radial where you can make circle.
There are lot more options which you can use.
It's worth to explore these options of this tool.
"""So, I set the shape to Linear and I delete the scrap layer here."""
"""Now I am working on the Sky layer here, the gradient is set from black to white, from making the image transparent to revealing the image. And I go back to the layer dialog and check if I have activated the"
I want to paint the layer mask
and select the Zoom tool to zoom into the image.
This needs a bit of practice.
I will start at this point here and end here.
I want to have the gradient straight because gradient in this way would result in such an image which I don’t want.
Press ctrl + z to undo the step.
"""So, I press the control key and now the movement of the slider here is limited to 5 degrees."""
So I start making it from here to this point.
"""When you go back to full image, you can see that this is my gradient."""
"""And when I switch off other layers, only the upper part of the image is visible in the top layer and others are in the background."""
But I don’t think this looks very convincing.
"""This looks a bit artificial, so I want to make the sky a bit brighter now."""
"""For doing that, first I have to deactivate the layer mask and activate the layer itself for working on it. Otherwise I would have used curves tool on the layer mask."""
You can always identify the active part of the layer by white frame around it.
"""So, let's  try this here."""
"""Now we want to brighten the sky, so I am pulling this up."""
I think this looks quite convincing because the sky is bright and the artificial border between the sky and sea vanished.
I think this will work.
"""So, let’s compare the image by switching of the sky layer and layers below it."""
You can see the difference.
This is the original image.
This layer is the new sky and this is the new land below.
"""The land could use a bit more of contrast I think but I am not sure, so I will have to try this."""
"""So, simply double click the Land layer and select the Overlay mode which gives you a bit more of contrast. But this is definitely too much, so I slide down the Opacity."""
Is it looking better or not?? But I think this is better.
Now I have got four layers.
"""The Background, the original image which is not really needed any more, the Land layer, a Land copy and the Sky with the layer mask."""
"""And I can change all these values here, without loosing the image information."""
That's the great advantage of using layers.
"""Now for the last part """"cropping"""":  Norman wanted to crop it into 7:5 ratio because his printer uses 7/5 inch paper."""
"""So, let's do that. 7:5, a Fixed Aspect Ratio."""
Where to crop?? I think I forgotten where Norman cropped this image.
So let's decide here.
"""I think, the tree should be included and the dry grass should be included."""
So I have to start here at the right corner and just pull up Crop tool.
"""This is simply the matter of taste and nothing to do with pumping , one could learn."""
"""There are Rule of Thirds,"""
let me put this in.
"""Here you see, the front side of the chapel is now one of the points of interest."""
Here is the more artistic Golden sections and it can be helpful but I think the best is simply your eye.
I want to save his image as a JEPG image.
And before that I have to sharpen it a little bit.
The traces of sharpening that were visible before I did all my manipulations are gone.
White lines were visible to see hallows.
"""I think, this time also I will use the Filters, Enhance, Sharpen mode."""
"""This is basically an unsharped mask, sharpening with some standard values pre-set."""
I will cover the unsharped mask in the later tutorial.
"""I have never used that and for that, I have to learn it myself"""
so that I can explain something about it.
I think this works well here.
I can go and save the image.
I am typing funny stuff today.
OK. I know that JPEG cannot handle image with multiple layers so the image is now exported and all the layer information is lost.
And gimp just gives a warning.
And I think 85% quality is good;
The perfect compromise between file size and image quality.
"""And now, I can go back with my sharpening and resizing the image to something that I could put it in my blog for the show notes."""
Go to Image >> Scale Image and I want Width of 600 pixels.
Just Scale it .
And now I sharpen it again. Sharpening should be the last step in your chain of things you do to an image.
It is really the last step.
The algorithm works well only if you don’t change anything after that.
No resizing also.
Lets look at this.
I think I can have bit more.
Ending basically on the same amount.
"""I am ok with this image now. I save this as """".(dot)600"""" so that I can know which image to put in the blog later."""
Let's compare the 2 images.
This is the one Norman made and this is the one I made.
My sky is better definitely and I think Norman did a better job with the sea and the chapel.
And the combination of this would be a really great picture.
I think I have over-done a bit with the brightening here.
"""Well, here I am back  to fix the sea layer in easy way."""
I make a copy of original on Background layer.
Rename the layer to Sea.
"""Now, I pull it above Land copy and below the Sky."""
And you can see now the Sky layer is not disturbed by this only the land is disturbed.
But I will mask that out.
"""To do that, I add a layer mask."""
"""Right click , Add Layer Mask and now I take a Grayscale copy of the layer."""
"""Now you see the land here, it's brighter."""
It's not like it was here but you see biggest changes  in the water.
And now let's work a bit on the layer mask here.
Click on Show  Layer Mask.
You see it here and switch the Sky off.
Now I select the Curves tool and I will adjust the curves in a way that the land gets darker.
And sea and sky get brighter.
Now let's look at the image.
Unclick Show Layer Mask.
Now you see that’s quite nice for the land with nearly no difference and the sea is better.
Now when I select the Sea layer you can see that the sea is better.
Now I will change the values in the image by using the Curves tool.
"""And I think, I should"""
"""give the sea a bit more contrast,"""
bit like this here.
The steep of the slope here is more contrast in the image.
This part of the histogram was sea.
"""So, I get here a lot of contrast."""
And just fiddle around with the curve until it fits a bit.
I haven’t tried this before; so I have to experiment here a little bit.
I think this is way better than the stuff I had before.
Now let's look at the border between the rocks here and sea.
I had a big problem there before.
So this time I nearly got no visible hallows.
"""And when I zoom into this here,"""
you can see something like hallow but it's simply surf at the beach here.
There is no hallow.
"""In my first tries, I tried to get differences between land sea and sky a bit more."""
I have simply over-done it.
"""But this way here, I think, it works better. So is there anything left to be done?"""
More information is available at http://meetthegimp.org

Good bye and hope to see you next time around.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on 2 Dimensional Arrays in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn-"""
what is a 2 Dimensional array.
We will do this through an example.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using"""
"""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
Let us start with the introduction to 2 dimensional Array.
2D arrays are stored in a row column matrix.
The left index indicates the row.
The right index indicates the column.
Starting index of a matrix or array in C and C++ is always 0.
"""Here, we see a 2 Dimensional array in a row column matrix."""
Starting index is 0.
"""Now, let us see how to declare 2 dimensional array."""
The Syntax for this is:
"""data-type ,array name, row and column."""
"""example, here we have declared a 2 dimensional array num with 2 rows and 3 columns."""
Now let us see an example.
"""I have already typed the program, let me open it."""
Note that our file name is 2d hyphen array dot c.
"""In this program, we will calculate the sum of the elements of the 2 dimensional array."""
Let me explain the code now.
This is our header file.
Here we have declared variables i and j.
Then we have declared num1 with 3 rows and 4 columns.
"""And num2, again with 3 rows and 4 columns."""
num1 and num2 are 2 dimensional arrays.
"""Here, we take elements of the matrix num1 as input from the user."""
The elements are stored row-wise.
We have considered i for rows and j for columns.
This for loop will check the condition that i runs from 0 to 2.
This for loop will check the condition that j runs from 0 to 3.
"""Similarly, here we take elements of the matrix num2 as input from the user."""
Here we display the matrix num1.
Here percent 3d is used to align the matrix on the terminal.
"""Now, here we display the matrix num2."""
Then we add the num1 matrix and the num2 matrix and display the result.
This is our return statement.
"""Now, click on Save."""
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space 2d hyphen array dot c space hyphen o space arr and press Enter."""
"""To execute, type dot slash arr (./arr), now press Enter ."""
Here we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num1.
I will enter the values now.
Now we can see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num2.
I will enter the values.
The output is displayed.
Here we can see the num1 matrix.
Here we can see the num2 matrix.
And this is the sum of num1 and num2.
Now we will see how to execute the same program in C++.
I have already made the program. I will open it and explain.
This is the program for 2 Dimensional arrays in C++.
Note that our file name is 2d hyphen array dot cpp.
The extension is dot cpp (.cpp).
Let me explain the code now.
This is our header file as iostream.
This is our using statement.
Here we have cout function as we use cout to print the output in C++.
Then we have cin function. We use cin to read  a line in C++.
"""Here, we use  / t  bit mean horizontal tab that is equivalent to 4 spaces."""
Rest of the code is similar to our C code.
Let us execute. Come back to a terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space 2d hyphen array dot cpp  hyphen o space arr1 and press  Enter."""
"""To execute, type dot slash arr1, now press Enter."""
I will enter the values.
"""Now, we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num2."""
I will give the values as:
The output is displayed.
"""We can see the num1 matrix, the num2 matrix."""
And this is the sum of num1 and num2.
Come back to our slide. Let us Summarize.
In this tutorial we learnt:
To add elements in a 2D array.
To print 2D array.
And to calculate the sum of 2Dimensional array.
As an assignment: Write the  program that takes two 2Dimensional arrays as input from the user.
Subtract them and find the result.

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on conditional statements in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about-  if,  else,  else if in awk."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the previous awk tutorials on our website."""
You should have familiarity with any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
A conditional statement allows us to check a specified condition before performing an action.
"""Let’s learn how conditional statements like if, else, else-if work in awk."""
"""Like any programming language, the syntax of 'if -else' statement is:"""
if conditional-expression1 is true then perform action1.
else if conditional-expression2 is true then perform action 2.
A number of else if statements may follow after this.
"""At the end, if none of the specified conditional expressions are true then perform action n."""
The else and else-if portions are optional. Let us go through an example.
We will use the same awkdemo.txt file that we have used earlier.
"""Say, we need to give 50% increment in stipend to the students getting more than 8000 rupees."""
Let us create an awk file for this condition.
"""Type the following code as shown, in a text editor and save it as cond dot awk. I have already done this."""
The same file is also available in the Code Files link.
"""In this code, we have set the Output Field Separator as colon."""
The first print statement prints the field headings.
"""Next, the 'if' statement will check whether the value of the 6th field is greater than 8000."""
"""If yes, the second print statement will get executed."""
$6 into 1.5 inside this print statement will multiply the 6th field value by 1.5 .
Let’s execute this code now.
"""Open the terminal by pressing CTRL, ALT and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using 'cd' command.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen capital F pipe symbol within double quotes space hyphen small f space cond dot awk space awkdemo dot txt. Press Enter."""
The output shows only one student’s record with the incremented stipend who fulfilled the condition.
"""Now, suppose the rule changes: 50% increment in stipend for students who get more than 8000 rupees."""
"""Otherwise, give 30% increment. How can we do that?"""
We need to add an 'else' block.
Switch to the cond dot awk file once again.
Let us add the following line of code. Before the last closing curly brace press Enter.
else press Enter.
print space dollar 2 comma dollar 6 comma dollar 6 into 1.3
Press the up-arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
Observe the output now. Yojna Chaudhury was previously getting 1000. Now she is getting 1300.
Let’s change the rules again. 50% increment for student getting more than 8000 rupees.
"""40% increment for student getting more than 4000 rupees. Otherwise, give 30% increment."""
Switch to the code. Update the code as shown.
Let me clear the terminal.
"""Now, press up-arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter."""
"""This time, notice that the student Mira Nair has got 40% increment."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt about Conditional statements like: if ,  else, else if in awk."""
"""As an assignment, give grades according to the rules: If mark is greater than equal to 90, grade will be A."""
"""If mark is greater than equal to 80 but less than 90, grade will be B."""
"""If mark is greater than equal to 70 but less than 80, grade will be C."""
"""If mark is greater than equal to 60 but less than 70, grade will be D. Otherwise, grade will be F."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on while loop in java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn: About the while loop and How to use it."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse 3.7."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of relational operators in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown. [1]"""
Here is the structure of a while loop.
It has two parts.
One is the loop running condition and the  second is the loop variable.
Let us now look at an example. Switch to Eclipse.
"""Here, we have the eclipse IDE and  the skeleton   required  for rest of the code."""
I have created a class WhileDemo and added the main method to it.
We shall print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop. Type: int n = 1;.
This variable 'n' is going to be our loop variable.
Type: while in parenthesis n less than or  equal to  10  open and close braces.
This condition is called  loop running condition.
It means the loop will run as long as this condition is true.
"""In our case, it will run as long as the value of 'n' is less than or equal to 10."""
And it will stop only when the value of 'n' becomes greater than 10.
"""Inside the loop, we shall print the value of 'n'."""
System.out.println(n); and then increment it n = n + 1;
"""This way, first 1 is printed and then the value of 'n' becomes 2."""
Then the loop condition is checked.
"""Since it is true, 2 is printed and n becomes 3."""
And so on.. loop progresses until 10 is printed.  After that 'n' becomes 11 and the condition is not true and the loop will stop.
"""So, let us see the code in action."""
Save and  run.
"""As we can see, the numbers from 1 to 10 are printed."""
"""Now, we shall  print numbers from 50 to 40."""
"""So, we start with 50. Change n = 1 to n = 50."""
"""And We go till 40,"""
"""in other words, as long as 'n' is greater than or equal to 40. So, change the condition to  n   greater than or equal to 40."""
"""And since we are looping from a bigger number to a smaller number, we have decremented the loop variable."""
So Change n=n+1 to n=n-1.
"""Save and run. As we can see, the numbers from 50 to 40 have been printed."""
Now we shall print the first 10 multiples of 7.
"""To do that, we start with 7."""
"""So, change n = 50 to n = 7 and then we end with 70."""
Change the condition to n less than or equal to 70.
"""This way, we make sure that the loop stops at 70."""
"""To get the multiples, we shall increment the loop variable by 7."""
"""So, change n=n-1 to n= n+7;"""
"""This way, first 7 is printed and  then 'n' becomes 14, 14 is printed and so on until 70. Save and run."""
"""As we can see, the first 10 multiples of 7 are  printed."""
We can also use a while loop to get the sum of digits of a number.
Let us see how to do so.
"""First, clear the main method."""
int n equal to 13876;. This is the number.
Then int dSum equal to  0. The variable dsum which is symbolic for digit sum will contain the sum of digits.
Type: while n greater than 0 open close parentheses.
The reason for using this condition will be evident in a while.
"""To get the sum of digits, we must first get the digits."""
"""To do that, we use the modulo operator."""
"""Type: dSum = dSum + (n % 10) So, we get the unit's digit and add it to dsum."""
After that  we remove the digit by dividing by 10. n = n / 10
"""So when the loop is  run  for the first time, dSum will be 6 and 'n' will become 1387."""
"""And when the loop is run for the second time, dSum will be sum of 7 and 6 which is 13 and 'n' will become 138."""
"""And so on as the loop progresses, the digits will be  removed from n and finally"""
n becomes zero. After that the condition 'n greater than 0' will be false and the loop will stop.
"""So, let us now add a print statement:"""
System.out.println(dSum)
Let us see the code in action. Save and run.
"""As we can see, the sum of digits which is 25 has been printed."""
This way a while loop which is one of the most fundamental constructs in programming can be used.
This brings us to the end of the tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we have learned: About while loop.How to use it."""
"""As an assignment for this tutorial, solve the following problem."""
"""Given a number, compute its reverse by using a while loop. Example: 19435 => 53491"""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Text tool features” using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
Manual kerning Spell checking
Super-script Sub-script.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS Inkscape version 0.48.4."
I will be recording this tutorial in maximum resolution mode. This is to accommodate all the tools that will be demonstrated.
Let us open Inkscape.
"""Earlier in the series, we learnt to create and format text using the Text tool."""
"""Now, we will learn some important features of the Text tool. Click on it."""
Let us start with Manual kerning.
"""Horizontal kerning, Vertical shift and Character rotation are called manual kerns."""
Type the word Spoken.
Keep the cursor after the alphabet “S”.
Horizontal kerning adds space after the selected letter.
Click on the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the space between the letters “S” and “p”.
Notice that the space is introduced only between the letters “S” and “p”.
Let me keep the Horizontal kerning parameter as 3.
"""The next icon, i.e. Vertical shift, shifts the letters after the selected letter up or down."""
Click on the up and down arrows.
Observe the letters after the cursor have shifted up and down.
Keep this parameter as 15.
"""Next, we will rotate our characters using Character rotation."""
This icon rotates only a single character which is right after the cursor.
"""So, place the cursor before the letter “e”."""
Click on the up and down arrows of Character rotation and observe that the letter “e” rotates.
"""To apply the kerns to more than one character, select the characters first then give the values."""
"""Let me select the letters “p” and “o” and give Horizontal kerning parameter as 5,"""
Vertical shift parameter as 10 and Character rotation parameter as 20.
Observe the changes.
"""To remove the kerns, go to Text menu."""
Click on Remove Manual Kerns.
Manual Kerns can be used only in Regular text.
"""In Flowed text, these options will be disabled."""
"""To check, create a text box."""
"""Observe, the Manual kerns options are now disabled."""
Press Ctrl + Z to undo this action.
"""Next, we will learn about Spell check feature."""
"""To explain the Spell check feature, I will copy text from LibreOffice writer that I had saved already."""
Press Ctrl + A to select the entire text and then press Ctrl + C to copy it.
Now come back to Inkscape.
Click on the canvas and press Ctrl + V to paste the text.
Go to Text menu and click on Check Spelling option.
A new dialog box appears.
All text is checked regardless of whether it is selected or not.
"""When a suspect word is found, it will be highlighted with a red box and the cursor will be placed before the text."""
A list of suggestions appears for the word “http”.
Since the spelling is correct we will add this word to the dictionary.
"""To do so, click on Add to Dictionary button."""
This will cause the spell checker to accept the word as correctly spelled always.
"""Next, the word “tutorial” is highlighted."""
"""Since the spelling is wrong, select the correct word from the suggestion list which is “tutorial”."""
Now click on Accept button.
"""If you click on Ignore, all other similarly spelled words in the document will get ignored."""
"""If you click on Ignore once, the word will get ignored only once i.e the first time only."""
"""If you want to stop the spell-checking process, click on Stop."""
We can restart the process by clicking the Start button.
Spell checking will begin with the text at the top-right and work down the canvas.
Let us close this dialog box now and keep this text aside.
"""Next, we will learn to write Superscript and Subscript."""
Type the mathematical formula (a+b)2 = a2+b2+2ab.(a + b whole square is equal to a square plus b square plus 2ab).
We have to change the number 2 as square in three places.
Select the first 2. Go to Tool controls bar. Click on Toggle Superscript icon.
"""In a similar way, change the remaining 2s."""
"""Next, we will write a chemical formula using subscript."""
"""So, type “H2SO4”."""
Here 2 and 4 should be written as subscripts.
First select 2. Go to Tool controls bar and click on Toggle Subscript icon.
"""In a similar way, change the 4."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
Manual kerning Spell checking
Super-script and Sub-script.
Here are 2 assignments for you-
Write the text “How are you” and change the font size to 75.
Keep the cursor next to “w”. Change Horizontal kerning parameter to -20.
Select the words are. Change the Vertical shift parameter to 40.
Select the words you. Change the Character rotation parameter to -30.
Write the following formulae using Sub-script and Super-script options.
Silver sulfate - Ag₂SO₄.
a2−b2=(a−b)(a+b)
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Purchases and Reports in FrontAccounting
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to Add Suppliers"""
Make a Purchase Order Entry
Create Suppliers invoice and  Generate various reports on the transactions
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04"""
And FrontAccounting version 2.4.7
"""To practise this tutorial, you must have knowledge of: Higher secondary commerce and accounting and  Principles of Bookkeeping"""
And you should have already set up an Organisation/Company in FrontAccounting
"""If not, for relevant FrontAccounting tutorials please visit this website."""
Start the XAMPP services before you begin working on FrontAccounting interface.
Let us understand the meaning of Purchase.
Purchase refers to  A product or service that has been bought by an individual or business.
A business attempting to acquire goods or services to accomplish its goals.
"""Now, let us open the FrontAccounting interface."""
"""Open the browser, type localhost/account and press Enter."""
The login page appears.
Type the username as admin and the password. Then click on the Login button.
FrontAccounting interface opens. Click on the Purchases tab.
Let us see the procedure for Purchases in FrontAccounting.
The steps to be followed for a Purchase Entry are: Add Suppliers
Make a Purchase Order Entry
Receivable note from a Supplier And Suppliers invoice
But first let us understand the meaning of Supplier.
Supplier is a person or business that supplies goods or services.
Switch back to the FrontAccounting interface.
"""In the Maintenance panel, click on the Suppliers link."""
"""Here, we need to fill in all the necessary information related to a Supplier. I have filled the required details as shown here."""
Scroll down. Click on Add New Supplier Details button at the bottom of the window.
We can see the confirmation message for the saved entry.
We need to apply these changes for the new Purchase Order Entry.
Scroll down and click on the Update Supplier button at the bottom of the window.
The success message shows that we have updated the supplier.
Scroll down. Click on the Back link at the bottom of the window.
Let us make a Purchase Order Entry. It is used to register all Purchase Orders in the system.
"""In the Transactions panel, click on the Purchase Order Entry link."""
We can see the details with the Supplier name and other related information.
This is because we have already updated the details of the supplier earlier.
It is mandatory to give Supplier’s reference.
"""So, I will type the Supplier’s reference as S001."""
"""In the Item Description drop-down menu, select Item as Dell laptop."""
"""In the Quantity field, I will type 2 as the quantity."""
Select the Required Delivery Date accordingly.
"""By default, it will be 10 days after the order date. I’ll keep the same."""
"""Now, in the Price before Tax field, I will type the Price as 48,000."""
"""To save the entry, click on the Add Item button at the right end of the row."""
We can see the Amount Total along with the GST.
"""Now, click on the Place Order button at the bottom of the window."""
The success message shows that the Purchase Order has been placed.

"""The Spoken Tutorial Project Team conducts workshops and gives certificates. For more details, please write to us."""
The Spoken Tutorial Project is funded by  MHRD Government of India.
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on working with Linux Processes.
We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands.
"""If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial on the following website http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Also note that Linux is case sensitive. All the commands used in this tutorial are in lower case unless otherwise mentioned.
"""To understand what a process is, let me give you a brief explanation."""
Anything that is running in Linux is a process.
The shell that is running and taking our commands is a process.
The commands that we type on the terminal are processes when they are running.
The video in which you are seeing this tutorial is a process.
The browser running in which you have opened the spoken tutorial website is a process.
Shell scripts that are running are processes and so on.
A process can be defined as a program which is being executed i.e. which is running.
"""Processes are much like us. They are born, they die. They have parent and children."""
Let us first learn about the shell process.
The shell process is started by the Linux kernel as soon as we login to the system.
"""At this point, it would suffice to know that the Linux kernel is the core of the Linux operating system."""
It consists of the most essential components that make Linux run. The shell creates or gives birth to all the other user command processes.
Let us open a terminal.
We can see the command prompt on the terminal in the form of a dollar sign ($).
This is the job of the shell process.
"""Now, let us type any command, say date and press Enter."""
"""As soon as we do this, the shell process will create a process called date."""
"""Now, since the shell process has given birth to the 'date' process, we can say that the shell process is the parent of the 'date' process and the 'date' process is the child of the shell process."""
"""Once date process has shown the system date and time, it will die."""
A shell can also give birth to another shell process. Giving birth to a process or creating a process is also called spawning a process.
"""To spawn another shell process, simply go to the terminal and type “sh” and press Enter."""
"""We would see a new prompt appearing in the terminal. Now our original shell, let us call it 'shell 1', has given birth to a child shell or sub shell; let us call it 'shell 2'."""
"""Now, you may run a command in the new command prompt as well. Let us run 'ls' command in this new command prompt."""
"""Now at the command prompt, type “ls” and press Enter. We can see a list of files and directories."""
Now a new process named 'ls' is created.
"""Here, 'shell 2' is the parent of 'ls', while 'shell 1' is the grandparent of 'ls'. 'ls' is the child of 'shell 2', while 'shell 2' itself is the child of 'shell1'."""
"""To kill 'shell 2', simply type at the new prompt “exit” and press Enter."""
This will kill 'shell 2' and we will get back our original command prompt.
"""Continuing our analogy between us and processes, we know that each of us have some attributes that identify us. Those attributes can be our name, parents' name , date of birth, PAN card no. etc."""
"""Similarly, processes also have attributes like PID(Process ID), PPID(Parent Process ID), Start time  etc."""
Most of these attributes are maintained by the kernel in a process table.
Each process is uniquely identified by a unique integer called the 'PID'. 'PID' is allotted by the kernel when the process is born.
The 'PID' of the parent process that spawned a new process say 'P1' is called the 'PPID' of 'P1' process.
"""To see the PID of the current shell, at the prompt type: echo space dollar dollar and press Enter."""
A number would be shown . This is the 'PID' of the current shell.
The one command that we would use a lot while talking about processes is the 'ps' command.
'ps' or process status is a command which displays the processes running in the system.
Let us see what happens if we run this command without any options.
"""Now, at the command prompt, type: “ps” and press Enter."""
"""This way, we would normally see the list of all the processes owned by the user running the program."""
You can see the name of the process under 'CMD' heading.
"""Other than this, you can see the PID, TTY or the console at which the process is running,"""
"""the TIME, that is the total processor time that has been used since the process started."""
"""On my machine, it displays two processes."""
"""One is the bash, the shell process we are using. The other is the 'ps' process itself."""
The other important thing to note here is that the PID of the shell process is same as that shown by the echo space dollar dollar command.
"""If we spawn a sub-shell, let us see what happens. At the terminal, type “sh” and press Enter."""
"""Now, in the new prompt that appears on the new line, type “ps” and press Enter."""
Now we can see 3 processes in the list . The process 'sh' has been added.
"""Here, again notice that the PID of the bash process is same as that before."""
"""'ps' comes with many options as we would see next. First option that we would see, displays more attributes for the processes listed."""
"""Now, at the prompt, type: ps space minus f and press Enter. This again will list three processes as in the previous case."""
"""Bash, sh and ps -f."""
The only difference is now more attributes are listed.
"""'UID' gives the user name of the user who has started the process. Also, it shows the 'PPID' that is the 'PID' of the parent process that created the process."""
"""For example, see that 'bash' process is the parent of 'sh' process; so the 'PID' of the 'bash' is same as the 'PPID' of 'sh' process."""
"""Similarly, since 'sh' process is the parent of 'ps' process, the PID of 'sh' process is the same as the PPID of the ps -f process."""
"""'C' stands for processor utilization. Currently, this is the integer value of the percent usage of the processor over the lifetime of the process."""
It will be displayed as 0 (zero) in this case as the usage is negligible.
"""The STIME field gives the time at which the process started, the rest we have already seen while running 'ps'."""
Processes are of two types : First one is User processes- those are started by the users.
For example 'ps' or for that reason most commands that we run on the terminal.
"""Second one is the system processes- those processes are started by the system, often during system startup or user login."""
Example of system process can be bash.
"""Sometimes we may want to see all the processes, both- system processes as well as user processes."""
Then we use the  'minus e'  or the 'minus capital A' option.
Go to the terminal and type at the prompt: ps space minus e and press Enter.
We can see a large list of processes.
"""To get a multi-page display, just type at the prompt:"""
ps space minus e space vertical bar space more and press Enter.
"""As we have seen before, more will cause only as many processes to be listed as can fit in one window."""
"""As we press Enter, we scroll through the list of processes."""
The first process in this list is interesting. It is called the init process.
It is the process from which almost all other processes are spawned.
It has a 'PID' of 1.
"""To come back to the prompt, press 'q'."""
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learned about process, shell process, spawning of process, process attributes and different types of processes."""
We also learned the use of 'ps' command. This brings me to the end of this tutorial.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Switch Case in Java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the switch case construct in Java."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu v 11.10, JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of if else statement in Java."""
"""If not, please go through the tutorials on these topics available at our website which is as shown [1]"""
switch case: The switch case is used to perform actions based on the value of a variable.
Here is the syntax for a switch case statement.
Let us use it now.
I already have Eclipse opened.
I have created a class named SwitchCaseDemo.
"""Now, let us add some variables."""
"""Inside the main method, we will create a variable day of type int."""
"""So, type inside the main method int day and we can give it a value equal to 3 semicolon."""
"""Now, let us create a variable dName of type String."""
String dName we can initialize it to null.
"""Here, dName is a variable to hold the name of the days of a week."""
day stores the day number.
"""Now, we will type the switch case statement. So, next line, type:"""
switch within brackets day then open curly brackets Press Enter.
This statement defines which variable is under consideration for the cases.
"""Next line, type:"""
case 0 colon.
"""Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Sunday semicolon."""
Then type: Next line break;
This statement says that if the day is 0 then dName must be set to Sunday.
Note that a break statement must be used at the end of each case.
"""without the break statement, the switch-case functions in a complex fashion."""
It will be explained in subsequent part of the tutorial.
"""Similarly, let us type the remaining cases."""
"""Next line, type: case 1 colon."""
"""Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Monday  semicolon."""
"""Next line, type break;"""
Then type: case 2 colon.
"""Next line, dName equal to  Tuesday then semicolon."""
"""Next line, type break;"""
"""Then next line, case 3 colon."""
"""Next line, type: dName equal to within double quotes Wednesday  then semicolon"""
"""Next line, type break;"""
Then case 4 colon.
"""Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Thursday then semicolon."""
Then break .
"""Then next line, type: case 5 colon."""
dName equal to within double quotes Friday then semicolon.
Then break.
Then case 6 colon.
"""Next line, type: dName equal to within double quotes Saturday  then semicolon."""
Then type: break semicolon.
Then close the brackets.
"""Now, let us add a print statement and see the code in action."""
"""So, next line, type: System  dot out dot println within brackets dName  then semicolon."""
Now Save and run the file.
Now press Ctrl S and Ctrl F11 keys.
We get the output as: Wednesday which is corresponding to the case 3.
"""Now, let us change the value of the  day and see the result."""
So change 3 to 0.
Now Save and Run that file.
"""As we can see, the output is Sunday corresponding to the case 0."""
"""Now, what if there is no case corresponding to the value. So, let us see that."""
Change day equal to -1 Save and run the file.
"""As we can see, there is no output."""
But it would be better if we could have a case for all other values.
That is done by using the default keyword.
"""So, after the last case, type:"""
default  colon.
"""Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Wrong Choice then semicolon."""
"""Next line, break  semicolon."""
We do not say case default;
Note that we simply use the keyword default.
"""Now, let us run the code. So save and run the file."""
"""As we can see, the default case is executed and the required message Wrong choice is printed."""
Let us try with another random value.
Change -1 to 15.
"""As we can see, again the default case is executed."""
"""Now, let us see what happens if we remove the break statement."""
"""So, Let us change day = 15 to day = 4,"""
remove the corresponding break statement for day =4.
"""Although the case is 4, we get the output as Friday and not Thursday."""
This is because of the way switch case works.
"""First, the value of day is compared with 0."""
"""Then with 1, then with 2 and so on with all the possible cases."""
"""When a match is found, it executes all the case from the match onwards."""
"""In our case, it executed case 5 after case 4."""
Then it stops because of the break statement in case 5.
"""To avoid that, we need to add a break statement in each case."""
Let us now add the break statement we have removed.
"""So, type: break semicolon."""
Now let us run the code.
"""As we can see, now only case 4 is executed."""
"""As a rule, remember to use a break statement in every case, to avoid errors."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt how to use switch case construct and how to use break statement."""
"""As an assignment, write a program that has a name and gender as a variable. Use a switch case statement that prints “Hello Mr....” for males and “Hello Ms...” for females."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Getting started with Eclipse.
"""In this tutorial, we are going to learn:"""
How to  create a project and add a class in Eclipse
How to write a java program and
How to run a java program in Eclipse.
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10, Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have"""
Eclipse installed on your system.
"""If not, for relevant tutorial please visit our website as shown."""
Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment.
"""It is a tool on which one can write, debug and run java programs easily."""
Now let us open Eclipse.
"""Press Alt F2 and in the dialog box, type eclipse and hit Enter."""
We have the Workspace Launcher dialog box.
A workspace is a location where all your project related data and your eclipse related files are stored.
There is already a location which is the default location.
"""Using the Browse feature, a different directory can also be selected."""
"""For now, let us proceed with the default directory."""
Click OK to proceed.
And we have the Welcome to Eclipse page.
Click Workbench  which is  at the top-right corner of the page.
And here we have Eclipse IDE. Now let us add a project.
"""Go to File , New,  select Project."""
"""In the list of projects, select Java Project."""
"""Also note that, for most of our tutorials, we will be using Java Project. Click Next."""
"""In the project name, type EclipseDemo."""
Notice an option that says Use default location.
"""If this option is selected, all the 'EclipseDemo' project data is stored in the default workspace."""
"""If it is unselected, using the Browse feature, a different location can also be selected."""
"""For now, we’ll use the default location."""
"""click Finish, located at the bottom right corner of the Wizard."""
We get the Open Associated Perspective dialog box.
A perspective refers to the way items are arranged in Eclipse.
The dialog box is suggesting a perspective that is suited for Java development.
Select Remember my decision  and click Yes.
Here we have EclipseIDE with the project. Now let us add a class to the project.
"""Right click on the project, New and select Class."""
"""In the class name, give DemoClass."""
"""Notice that in Modifiers, we have two options, public and default."""
"""For now, leave it as public."""
The other options will be discussed in subsequent tutorials.
"""And in the list of method stubs, select the option that says, public static void main."""
The other options will be discussed in subsequent tutorials.
"""Click Finish, located at the bottom right corner of the wizard."""
And here we have the class file.
Notice that there are a lot of partitions. These are called portlets.
We have the Package Explorer portlet that behaves like a File Browser.
We have the Editor portlet in which we write the code.
And the Outline portlet which gives us hierarchy of the project.
Each portlet can also be resized.
They can also  be minimized by using the Minimize button.
They can be restored by using the Restore button.
Now let us minimize other portlets and focus on the Editor.
"""As we can see, there is already some code, Eclipse has generated for us."""
The code generated here depends on the options we select while creating the class.
"""Now, let us add a print statement here."""
Type: System.out.println in parenthesis in quotes  “Hello Eclipse”
Add a semicolon at the end of the statement.
Save the file by clicking  File and select Save.
"""Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Control  S  also."""
"""To run this program, right click on the editor, go to Run as and select Java Application."""
"""We see that if something is printed, the Output console shows the output."""
"""If our code had problems, the problems would have been shown on the Problems portlet."""
Here is how you write and run a Java program in Eclipse.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt: how to create a project in eclipse and add a class to it, how to write java source code and how to run a java program in Eclipse."""
"""As an assignment for this tutorial, create a project by the name Display"""
and add a class to the 'Display' project by the name 'Welcome'.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Static Variables.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: What are static variables,"""
creating static variables and how to use static variables.
"""Here, we are using: Ubuntu 12.04,  JDK 1.7 and   Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
"""You should also have the knowledge of classes, objects  and instance variables in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
A static variable is a variable which is associated with the entire class.
It is also called a class variable.
It is declared using the static keyword.
We have seen about static variable briefly in the earlier tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we will see it in detail."""
"""Now, we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called StaticVariableDemo."""
"""Inside this project, we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Static variables."""
"""So, right-click on src folder and click New > Class and type the name of the class as StudentEnroll and press Enter."""
Let us illustrate the usage of static variables with an example.
Consider a class created to represent student enrollments in an organisation.
"""This class contains the Name, Id , Branch and Total Count of students enrolled."""
"""Now, let us visualize what happens when student enrollments are done."""
"""By default, Total Count is 0. The Name of the first student is ADIL."""
"""Id is IT101, Branch is IT."""
Now the Total Count is updated as 1.
"""Similarly when the second student AMAL gets enrolled, Total Count is updated to 2."""
"""When the third student CAROL gets enrolled, Total Count is updated to 3."""
Now we can identify that the variable Total Count is common to all the objects and has a single value.
"""So, the variable Total Count can be represented as a static variable."""
"""We can also see that the variables Name, Id and Branch have their own copies for each object."""
Also they have specific values for each object.
"""So, these variables can be treated as instance variables."""
"""Now, let us look at the code representing the student Enroll class."""
"""The instance variables are declared as id, name and branch."""
The variable count is declared as static since it is common to the whole class.
"""When a class is loaded, a static variable occupies a single fixed memory location."""
Whereas Instance variables of each object occupy separate memory locations.
Now click on Source > and select Generate Constructor using Fields.
Delete the super keyword from the generated code.
"""This constructor can initialise the values of the id, name and branch fields."""
We also need to increment the value of the variable count by one every time an object is created.
"""So, inside the constructor, type: count ++ semicolon."""
"""Now we will add a method showData( ) to this class, to print the values of all the variables."""
"""So, type public void showData( )  within brackets type the following code to print the values of id, name, branch, and total number of students enrolled."""
Now right-click on the default package and click on New > Class and then type name as Demo.
"""Inside this class, we will have the main method."""
"""So, type main and then press ctrl+space to generate the main method."""
Now we need to print the Student Enrollment data.
We will create a few objects of StudentEnroll class to represent student enrollments.
"""So, type the following code:  StudentEnroll s1 equals new StudentEnroll."""
Now we can pass the values of different arguments.
"""Within brackets, type IT101 as id, ADIL as name and IT as branch."""
Now let us invoke the showData method to print the enrollment details.
"""So, type: s1.showData( ). Now run the Demo program."""
We can see that the values of the instance variables corresponding to s1 get printed.
Also note that the value of the number of student enrollments is 1.
This is because we have created only 1 object.
Now type the following code to create one more object s2.
The showData method can be called once again using s2.
Again run the Demo Program.
We can see that the values of the instance variables corresponding to s2 get printed.
"""Also, note that the value of number of student enrollments is updated to 2 for both s1 and s2."""
Now create one more object s3.
Now let us Invoke the showData method again using s3.
Run the Demo program again.
We can see that the values of instance variables corresponding to s3 get printed.
Also note that the value of number of student enrollments is now updated to 3 in all the cases.
Now we can understand that value of number of student enrollments is common to all the objects.
Come back to slides.
The static modifier is also used along with the final modifier.
It is done to define a constant which is common to the entire class.
"""Conventionally, the names of such constant variables are spelt in uppercase letters."""
Now come back to eclipse.
Open the StudentEnroll class and type the variable declaration as  public static final String ORG_NAME = “IITB”;
"""As an example, if all the students are getting enrolled to the same organisation, say IITB."""
It can be represented by using a constant static variable say ORG_NAME.
"""If the name is composed of more than one word, the words are separated by an underscore."""
Usually we declare such constants with a public visibility.
Now go to the Demo class and type the following code.
Here you can see that ORG_NAME is accessed by using its class name StudentEnroll.
Now run the Demo program again.
We can see that the ORGANISATION name is getting printed as IITB.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about:"""
What is a static variable and when it is used
How to create and invoke the static variables.
"""As an Assignment, design a class CarService to represent a car service station."""
"""This class should contain variables to represent the following details: Name of the Service Station,"""
"""Car make, model and register number - which are in for service"""
No. of Cars in for Service.
Identify the instance variables and static variables.
Declare them using suitable keywords.
"""Define a constructor to initialise the values for Car make, model and register number."""
Define a method show( ) to print the values of all the variables.
"""Also, create a Demo class containing the main method to verify the results i.e create a few objects of CarService."""
Invoke the show( ) method using these objects.
"""Also, access the static variables directly using the class name."""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Java Servlets and JSPs.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
Web server  Web container.
We will also learn to create a simple Java Servlet  and JSP.
Firefox web-browser 21.0.
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of:"""
Core Java using Netbeans IDE and
HTML.
"""Before moving onto Servlets and JSP, let us first understand a web server."""
A web server is a system that delivers content to end-users over the Internet.
It is also known as Internet server.
A web container is a component of the web server that interacts with Java servlets.
It is also known as servlet container.
The servlet container allows the servlets to execute inside it.
"""Now, let us learn how to write a simple servlet."""
Switch to the Netbeans IDE.
Click on the Project tab on the left hand side of the IDE.
"""Earlier, we had created a simple Project named MyFirstProject."""
"""You can see it here, on the left hand side of the IDE."""
Let us now create a simple servlet inside this Project.
"""So, right-click on MyFirstProject."""
Go to New and click on Servlet.
A New Servlet window opens.
Type the Class Name as MyServlet.
Type the Package name as org.spokentutorial.
Then click on Next.
Click on Add information to deployment descriptor (web.xml).
We can see that the Class Name is org.spokentutorial.MyServlet.
We can see that the Servlet Name is same as that of the Class Name which is MyServlet.
Note that the URL pattern is the same name as that of the Class Name. i.e MyServlet.
We can change it to MyServletPath.
Then click on Finish.
The source code created by the IDE for MyServlet.java is seen in the Source Editor window.
We see MyServlet.java is created in the package org.spokentutorial.
Notice that the servlet is just like any other Java class
except that the servlet does not have a main method.
"""Now, let us learn something about Glassfish Server."""
A servlet is deployed in a servlet container.
We are using Glassfish as our server.
Servlet container is a component of Glassfish that interacts with servlets.
"""Now, let us come back to Netbeans IDE."""
Note that MyServlet extends the HttpServlet.
"""At the bottom of the code, we can see HttpServlet methods."""
Click on the plus sign on the left to view these methods.
"""We see the methods - doGet, doPost and getServletInfo methods."""
We can override these methods.
We can see that there is one more method named processRequest at the top.
We will delete processRequest and getServletInfo methods to avoid confusion.
"""So, we are left with two methods doGet and doPost."""
"""For now, we will look at the doGet method."""
doGet is the default method for any simple URLrequest.
"""So, we will type some code inside the doGet method."""
We had already deleted processRequest method.
"""So, remove the method call for processRequest method."""
Also remove it from the doPost method.
"""Now, let us come to the doGet method"""
We can see that there are two parameters that are passed to the doGet method.
One is the request and the other is the response object.
Also notice that request is of type HttpServletRequest.
And response object is of  type HttpServletResponse.
We will use the response object to send the HTML response back to the client side.
"""For that, we will have to create a PrintWriter object."""
Notice that the PrintWriter class is already imported.
"""So, inside the doGet method type: PrintWriter space writer equal to response dot getWriter open and close brackets semicolon."""
Press Enter.
"""On the next line, type:"""
writer dot println within brackets and double quotes Welcome.
"""Then, press Ctrl S to save the file."""
"""Now, let us run the servlet."""
"""So, on the left hand side, in the Projects tab right click on MyServlet dot java."""
"""Then, click on Run File."""
We get a Set Servlet Execution URI dialog box.
Click on OK.
"""When the browser window opens, look at the URL."""
It is localhost colon 8080 slash MyFirstProject slash MyServletPath.
"""Here, MyFirstProject is the context name and MyServletPath is the URL pattern that we had set."""
We can see the text Welcome printed on the browser.
Now go back to the Netbeans IDE.
"""In the println method, we can pass html code."""
"""For example, put Welcome in h3 tag."""
"""Now, save the file."""
"""Since we deployed this servlet earlier, we need not run it again."""
The web container automatically detects it.
"""So, we can go back to the browser."""
Refresh.We see the message Welcome in a different format.
"""Now, come back to the IDE."""
"""Thus, we have successfully created a servlet."""
We can create any web application using servlets.
We used the servlet to display an HTML code.
Notice that we have HTML code inside the Java code.
"""Even though this is possible, it is difficult to do for large web applications."""
And hence not a recommended practice.
It would be better to replace this using JSP or Java Server Pages.
We will see the use of servlets and JSPs.
Servlets and JSPs are used together to separate presentation from content.
Servlets act as the controller and JSPs act as the view .
Servlets contain HTML code inside Java code.
JSPs contain Java code inside HTML code.
We will learn more about these in the coming tutorials.
"""Now, switch back to Netbeans IDE."""
We will now create a simple JSP page.
"""So, right click on MyFirstProject."""
Go to New and click on JSP.
A New JSP window opens.
Type the Filename as welcome.
And then click on Finish.
Click on the Projects tab  on the left hand side.
We can see that Welcome.jsp is under Web Pages folder.
"""Now, in the editor, change Hello World to Welcome."""
"""Notice that Welcome is within  """"h1"""" tags."""
"""In the url, after MyFirstProject slash, type: welcome.jsp."""
We see the output Welcome.
"""Therefore, for presentation purpose JSP is preferred."""
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
About web server and web container.
To create a simple servlet.
To create a simple JSP.
Please make sure that you have completed this tutorial before proceeding further.

Welcome to Meet the GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""For today’s tutorial I promised you with a question and answer edition, so let’s start with some news."""
I have already informed you about 'gimpusers.com' and they have a great news about a video podcast of the GIMP but I think you know that podcast already.
"""So, let’s go to the download page and here you see that GIMP 2.4.0 release candidate and is available for Windows and I think for Apple Macintosh and in source for most linux systems except for mine"""
because Ubuntu is not able to cope with some libraries that are needed.
"""So, GIMP 2.4.0 is on the way and when you are on gimpusers.com, look at this area on the screen."""
It’s a mirror of two mailing lists that gives lot of information about the GIMP.
"""First, the """"gimp user"""" mailing list and I recommend you to read that."""
"""The """"gimp developer"""" list is above my head and perhaps above yours too."""
And here is a discussion which answers a question and I didn’t know about that.
Let’s see it here.
The 1st question here is asked by Alex Burs and he asks: what the sample point tab did?
And I didn’t understand the question.
But I knew Alex because he tried to help me with providing the files for you and set up google site for me.
The answer here is from Tim Jedlicka & I know TIM too because Tim has big server in the internet and a big pipe through the internet. And we are just now in the process of setting up possibility for you to do
I’ll keep you informing about it & just look into the block at meetthegimp.org and look if you find a download icon there.
Here Tim answers the question of Alex.
And I thank both of you for this question and answer conversation here.
Tim writes that sample points are created similar to guide except you have to hold down the Ctrl key & you can create a sample point by placing the cursor in the measurement bar and holding down Ctrl key whil
And there are some further questions but I will go through them later.
I never had heard about that and I have to try it.
"""To do that, I started the GIMP and load the image into it which is prepared to know as My Ship in the Fog."""
"""Now, I shall go to the ruler on the left side, press the Ctrl key and pull the ruler out and you can see here that the mouse cursor changes to an eye dropper and I get two lines instead of one."""
Just leave the mouse button and Ctrl key and you get a point with number one (1) on it.
"""And when I pull out the ruler with the mouse button pressed and without pressing the Ctrl key, I get only one line here which is used for adjusting things on it."""
Let’s try to do the same procedure from the ruler on the top.
I press the Ctrl key and mouse button and pull down the ruler and release it here.
"""So, here I have number two (2) and number one (1) is already there but I can see no dialog here."""
"""So, click on the tool options and select the Color Picker from the toolbox but I don’t see anything here."""
"""But remember, there was a dialog mentioned in the files; so I click on File, go to Dialogs and here is a dialog called Sample Points."""
"""When you click on it, you have got here sample points for 1 and 2."""
And this is one method of getting color information about different points in the image.
And now I know a better way for getting the color information.
"""I can change here pixel to RGB and I get the values for Red, Green, Blue and Alpha is displayed in terms of percentage."""
"""Here, with pixel you see the actual numerical value of colors and when RGB is selected, you see here the Hex code for HTML and I can change RGB in HSV color model or in CMYK color model and I will cover that"
The next question is also related to color and the color picker.
I had mentioned in my podcast of ‘Ship in the Fog’ that you can take the color picker and get color information of the image and Glulio asks here how to get the color information of resulting color and not th
One way of that you just saw but there is a different way also.
"""I have the Color Picker selected and when I press Shift and click into the image, I get the current color information. And you see here the ship, the trees are white and also the sky which is not very satisf"
And it’s because I have selected  white background.
"""So, I go to Layers dialog and change it to the original Background layer in dialog and you see it's fully different color from what you see on the screen."""
"""There is an option in Layers dialog called Sample merged and when you activate that, you get the result of all stacked layers and with the Sample merged you see in the Color Picker Information, the foregroun"
"""With Sample merged activated, you get results of all layers."""
"""When you de-activate the Sample merged option, you get only the color information from the active layer and I forgot to tell that in previous show and when you select the blue layer you get information of bl"
"""So go back, select Sample merged and you get result of all layers."""
There is another option here called Sample average and when you select it you get a large Color Picker and get an average of all the pixels in that area.
It’s good option for getting color information for noisy image where you have big difference between the single pixels.
Glulio has another tip for the GIMP.
"""If you use not only .xcf as a file name but xcf.pz2 or xcf.bz2, the GIMP compresses the image and you get a smaller file size."""
I don’t know if this works also on Windows machine and you have to try that.
Perhaps on Windows it would work if you name the file 'xcf.zip' but I don’t know if it is true.
Perhaps somebody should try it and post on the blog.
Another question comes from Dmitry.
He asks if I can increase the quality of the video by trying different codec.
But I didn’t find this codec H 264 for linux in a free version.
There is a commercial version but it’s too expensive for me.
This is just a hobby and I pay for uploading the stuff and it’s not much but I don’t want to spend money on this here.
"""But, I have a quality question for you."""
I am recording this in 800/600 pixels and scale it down to 640/480 pixels just because everyone does it and this way it works on Apple TV and so on.
My question to you is: Do you prefer the original file size 800/600?
The image is clearer and you could see it better.
The files get a bit larger and there are people out there who can’t really see this bigger files.
I will make a test file in 800/600 and upload it. Perhaps you can try it and give me some feedback.
"""I am very happy about the next comment here, from Rodrigo, who says that he is thinking not to buy photoshop but to take the GIMP for his graphic work."""
I got a question from Vitaly via email which says: Is there any way to use the Curve tool in a non destructive way??
"""Answer to this question is """"NO, not in GIMP""""."""
Photoshop can do that with this adjustment layer and there are lot of GIMP programmers who are working on that and trying to implement it.
"""But, up to now if you change your colors with Levels tool, it is in a way that you can’t undo your work without undoing all the steps you did after that."""
"""Another question is from Dudley and he came with """"tips from the top floor"""" to my podcast here and installed GIMP 2.2.17 on his computer and I would recommend him 2.3 or 2.4 released candidate because they"
"""And he is asking about a book """"Beginning GIMP: From Novice to Professional"""" by Akkana Peck and I have this book."""
It is really good if you are starting with the GIMP or you have a bit knowledge then it’s a very good book and it's hands on the book
and I can really recommend that book.
"""And if you want to buy it and you are staying in United States, I will put a link into the block where you can buy this book via offer and the shop owner gets some money out of that."""
"""Yesterday I got a nasty shock when I started my work again, after the summer break. And that should be shocking enough but I looked the 1st time in Meet the Gimp block with a Windows computer and in Internet"
And I was really shocked because all the images were blown up and nothing was fitting into the frames and so on.
"""As a last thing in the show, I have a link tip for you."""
"""The """"Photocast Network"""" is a greater source for photo podcast and I am already a member but I am not on the website."""
"""Check out the website. There is a podcast made by the members of the """"Photocast Network"""" and it is called """"Focus Ring"""" and just today episode 8 came out."""
And eventually Meet The Gimp will pop out here on the left side.
"""I want to ask you for a favor; spread the word about Meet The GIMP. And if you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org and  more information is available at http://meetthegimp.org."""
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create and edit multiple objects using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:  copy and paste objects"""
Duplicate and clone objects
Group and Order various objects
Multiple selection and invert selection
Clipping and Masking.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.48.4"
Go to Dash home and type Inkscape.
You can open Inkscape by clicking on the logo.
Let's open the Assignment_1.svg file that we created earlier.
I had saved it in my Documents folder.
First we will learn how to copy and paste an object.
"""To do so, we should first select an object. So, click on the pentagon."""
"""Now, press Ctrl + C on your keyboard to copy it."""
Now press Ctrl + V to paste the object. You can see a copy of the pentagon on the canvas.
There are 3 other ways of creating copies of objects.
"""In all these 3 methods, a copy of the object is created exactly above the original one."""
The first method is called Paste Special.
Recall that we had already pressed Ctrl + C to copy the object.
"""To paste the object in the exact location from where it was copied, press Ctrl + Alt + V keys."""
Move the copied object to see the original object right below it.
Let us move these two objects and keep it aside.
"""The second method is called Duplication. For duplication, we do not need to copy the object first."""
Select the pentagon and press Ctrl + D keys on your keyboard.
Now a duplicate pentagon is created exactly on the top of the original one.
Let us move the duplicated object to see the original one below it.
The changes made on the duplicated object does not affect the original object.
Let us check this by changing its color to green and reducing its size.
The third method is called Cloning.
Click on the ellipse and press Alt + D to create a clone.
"""As before, the cloned object is created exactly above the original one."""
Let us move it aside to make it visible.
Please note that the cloned object will always be linked to the original object.
The original object is also known as its parent.
"""Any modifications on the original object, that is, in size, color etc. will affect its clone."""
"""Let us check this by changing the original object's color to pink, rotating it and reducing its size."""
Observe that the exact same changes are replicated in the cloned object automatically.
"""To unlink the clone from the original object, first select the clone and then press Shift + Alt + D."""
"""Now, select the original object again and change its size."""
Observe that the cloned object does not get affected.
The short-cut icons for these operations are present in the command bar as shown.
"""To select multiple objects, hold the Shift key and click on the objects that you want to select."""
I will select one ellipse first. Then I will hold the Shift key and select the other ellipse.
Notice that both the objects are now selected.
We can now group them by pressing Ctrl + G keys together.
Notice the ellipses are now grouped as a single object.
You can move them around and you will notice that both the objects move together as one object.
Try resizing the group and you will notice that both the objects get resized proportionately.
Change the colour to blue and observe that both the objects change to the same colour.
What do we do if we want to change the properties of only one of the objects in a group?
"""To select an object within a group, press the Ctrl button and click on the object."""
"""By this action, we can enter inside the group and select individual objects."""
"""To exit the group, click anywhere on the blank space on the canvas."""
"""To un-group objects, first select the group and press either Ctrl + Shift + G keys or Ctrl + U keys."""
Now the ellipses are un-grouped.
The short-cut icons for these operations are present in the command bar as shown.
"""To select all the objects on the canvas, press Ctrl + A keys."""
"""To un-select all the objects, click anywhere on the blank space on the canvas."""
"""If we want to select all the objects except a particular one, we can use the Invert Selection option."""
"""Let's say, we want to select all the objects except the arrow."""
"""So, first click on the arrow. Now, go to Edit menu and click on Invert selection."""
Notice that all the objects in the canvas are now selected except the arrow.
"""Now, let us learn how to order the objects."""
Let me move the smaller pentagon on top of the larger pentagon.
"""Now, let us draw a star and keep it on top of the smaller pentagon."""
Select the smaller pentagon. Go to Object menu and click on Raise.
Notice the smaller pentagon is now raised and is above the star.
"""Now, click on the star. Go to Object menu. Click on Lower."""
"""Now, the star is moved down or lowered and the larger pentagon now appears above it."""
"""Now, let me click on the larger pentagon. Go to Object menu and click on Raise to top. Now the larger pentagon appears on top."""
Now again go to Object menu. Click on Lower to bottom. Notice the larger pentagon is now moved to the bottom.
We can find these options in the Tool controls bar too.
"""Next, let us learn how to do Clipping."""
Clipping can make your complicated objects conform to another element or shape of your design by changing their entire shape quickly and easily.
"""I will use an image for this demonstration. I have an image here, in a new Inkscape file."""
"""On this image, I will draw an ellipse shape."""
"""Now, select the image and the ellipse."""
Go to Object menu. Click on Clip and then on Set.
Notice that the image is now clipped to the shape of the ellipse.
"""In Clipping, the shape of the object used as a clip defines the area that is visible."""
We can remove the clip by going back to Object menu.
Click on Clip and then click on Release.
Now the clip is released.
"""Next, let us learn to do Masking."""
Masking is very similar to Clipping.
"""In Masking, the transparency or lightness of one object determines the opacity of the second object."""
"""To demonstrate Masking, I will first make the ellipse semi-transparent using the gradient tool."""
"""Now, select the ellipse."""
Go to Object menu. Click on Fill and stroke.
Click on Radial gradient and then on Edit.
Move the RGB sliders to the extreme right to change the color to white.
Click on the Stop drop-down arrow and select the other stop.
Move the RGB sliders to the extreme left to change the color to black and change the alpha value to 255.
Click on Add stop to add one more color in between.
Click on the Node tool and move the diamond handle towards the top.
"""Now, select the image and the ellipse."""
Go to Object menu. Click on Mask and then on Set.
Observe that the mask is formed on the image.
Notice that the image takes on the transparency properties of the masking object which is the ellipse.
"""To remove the mask, go back to Object menu."""
Click on Mask and then on Release.
The mask is now removed.
Let us summarize.
"In this tutorial, we learnt to: Copy and paste objects"
Duplicate and clone objects
Group and Order various objects
Multiple selection and invert selection
Clipping and Masking.
Here are 2 assignments for you-
Create a vertical ellipse in grey color and a circle in black color.
Place the circle centrally on top of the ellipse.
It should look like an eye shape.
Now group them.
Next create a clone to make another eye.
Move it to the side to make both the eyes visible.
Create a circle in blue color and a square in red color.
Duplicate the square and keep both the squares in diagonally opposite direction.
Select both the squares and group them into a single object.
Place the circle centrally on top of the grouped squares.
Select both and create a clip. It should look like a bow.
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Getting to know Computers.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about"""
the various components of a computer.
We will also learn to connect the various components.
"""Generally, there are 2 types of computers -"""
Desktop  or Personal Computer and Laptop.
"""Now-a-days, tablet PCs or tabs for short, are also quite popular."""
Functions of a computer-
A computer performs five major functions irrespective of its size:
It accepts data or  instructions by way of input
It processes data as required by the user
It stores data
It gives results in the form of output
It controls all operations inside the computer.
Basic organization of a computer is as shown in this block diagram.
"""Input unit , Central Processing unit ,"""
' Output unit .
The Input unit helps to
enter the data and programs into a computer system in an organized manner.
"""Keyboard, mouse, camera and scanner are some of the input devices."""
The  Central Processing unit
performs operations like arithmetic and  logical operations and
stores data and instructions.
"""Typically, the  Central Processing unit or CPU looks like this."""
It has many  ports in the front and at the back of the unit.
We will learn about them in a little while.
"""It takes data and instructions, processes them and gives the output or results."""
The task of performing operations is called processing.
The output is then stored along with the data and  instructions in the storage unit.
"""The unit that supports the process of producing results from the data, is the output unit."""
Monitor and printer are some of the output devices.
"""Generally, a desktop computer has 4 main components:"""
Monitor CPU
Keyboard and Mouse .
"""A  camera, printer or scanner can also be connected to a computer."""
This is a monitor or the computer screen as we call it.
It looks like a TV screen.
It is the visual display unit of a computer.
It displays the computer's user interface.
One can open various programs and interact with the computer using the keyboard and mouse.
"""The  keyboard is designed to enter text, characters and other commands into a computer."""
This is the computer mouse.
"""Typically, it has 2 clickable buttons and a scroll button in between."""
"""Pressing the  left mouse button, activates most actions."""
"""Pressing the  right mouse button, activates more non-standard actions like shortcuts."""
The mouse wheel is used to scroll up and down by rolling the scroll button.
The  computer mouse is an alternative way to interact with the computer besides the  keyboard.
"""Now, let us see the various parts of the CPU."""
There is a prominent button on the front of the CPU which is the  POWER ON switch.
"""To turn on the computer, one needs to press this switch."""
"""There is a reset button too which helps us to restart the computer, if required."""
"""Also, on the front side, you will notice 2 or more  USB ports and a  DVD/CD-ROM reader-writer."""
The  USB ports are used to connect  pen-drives to the  computer.
And the  DVD/CD-ROM reader-writer is used to read or write a  CD or a DVD.
Now let's look at the back of the  computer.
"""The ports at the back, are used for connecting the CPU to the other devices of the computer."""
This is done using the cables.
There are many components inside the 'CPU'.
"""When the computer is ON, all these components work and generate heat."""
"""Fans at the back, provide the air flow required to cool the components."""
"""Otherwise, overheating can cause damage to the 'CPU', often leading to data loss."""
This is the case cooling fan.
It keeps the temperature of the CPU normal and prevents overheating.
"""Power Supply Unit, also called PSU, supplies power to the computer."""
"""Now, let's learn how to connect the various components to the CPU."""
"""Place all the components on the table, as shown."""
"""Place all the cables on the table, as shown."""
"""First, let's connect the monitor to the CPU."""
Connect the power cable to the  monitor as shown.
"""Now, connect the other end to a power supply socket."""
This is the power cable of the CPU.
Connect it to the CPU as shown.
"""Then, connect it to a power supply socket."""
"""Next, connect the  keyboard cable to the CPU as shown."""
The port  for the  keyboard is usually “purple” in colour.
You can connect the mouse to the port which is “green” in colour.
"""Alternately, you can connect the  USB keyboard and mouse to any of the USB ports."""
"""The remaining  USB ports can be used for connecting  pen drive, hard disk etc."""
This is a  LAN cable
and this is a LAN port.
It is a  wired connection that allows a computer to connect to a network.
The other end of the  LAN cable is connected to a   modem or a wi-fi router.
You will learn about configuring  wi-fi connections in another tutorial.
The  LED light will blink when the  LAN port is active and receiving activity.
You may notice that there are other serial ports on the CPU.
"""These are used for connecting  PDAs, modem or other serial devices."""
You will also notice that there are some parallel ports on the CPU.
"""These are used for connecting devices like  printer, scanner etc."""
"""Now, let's look at the audio jacks."""
The port in “pink” is used for connecting a microphone.
"""The port in “blue” is for connecting a line in, for eg- from a radio or tape player."""
The  port in “green” is for connecting headphone/speaker or line out.
"""Now that we have connected all our devices, let's turn on the computer."""
"""First of all, switch on the power supply buttons of the monitor and the CPU."""
"""Now, press the  POWER ON button on the monitor."""
"""And then press the  POWER ON switch, on the front of the CPU."""
"""Usually, you will see a string of words on a black screen when your computer first turns on."""
This is the BIOS system displaying information about
"""the computer's central processing unit,"""
"""information about how much memory the computer has,"""
and information about the hard disk drives and floppy disk drives.
BIOS is the software which gives the CPU its first instructions when the computer is turned on.
The whole process of loading the operating system is called booting the computer.
"""When all the necessary checks are done, you will see the operating system's interface."""
"""If you are an Ubuntu Linux user, you will see this screen."""
"""And if you are a Windows user, you will see this screen."""
"""Now, let us briefly look at a laptop."""
Laptops are portable and compact computers.
A laptop is small and light enough to sit on a person's lap while in use.
"""Hence, it is called a 'laptop."""
It has most of the same components as a  desktop computer including-
"""a display, a keyboard,"""
"""a  touchpad which is the pointing and navigating device,"""
a  CD/DVD reader-writer and
mic  and  speakers built into a single unit.
It also has a lan port  and  USB ports.
There is a  video port using which one can connect a  projector to the laptop.
The audio jacks are easily identifiable with respective icons for mic and headphones.
This is the inbuilt cooling fan in the laptop.
This helps to keep the laptop from overheating.
A  laptop is powered by electricity via an  AC adapter and has a rechargeable battery.
"""Hence, it is portable and can be used away from a power source."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
about the various components of a  desktop and  laptop
and how to connect the various components of a desktop.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Function calls in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about type of function calls namely-"""
call by value call by reference.
We will do this through an example.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with the introduction to function call by value.
It is a method of passing arguments to the function.
"When we pass a variable by value, it makes a copy of the variable before passing to the function."
"""Changes made to the arguments, inside the function, will remain in the function."""
It will not be affected outside the function.
Let us see a program on 'function call by value'.
I have already typed the program on the editor. I will just open it.
Please note our file name is callbyval.c.
"""In this program, we will calculate the cube of a number. Let me explain the code now."""
Here we have function cube having an argument as int x. .
"""In this function, we calculate the cube of x and return the value of x."""
"""Here we give the value of n as 8, 'n' is an integer variable."""
Then we call the function cube.
And print the value of 'n' and the cube of n.
And this is our return statement.
"""open the terminal window by pressing  Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile , type gcc space callbyval.c space hyphen o space val. Press Enter."""
"""Now, type ./val (dot slash val). Press Enter."""
The output is displayed as: Cube of 8 is 512.
Now we will see 'function call by reference'.
Let us go back to our slides.
It is another method of passing arguments to the function.
This method copies the address of the argument instead of the value.
"""Changes made to the arguments, inside a function, can affect them outside."""
In this we need to declare the arguments as pointer type.
Let us see an example on function call by reference.
Note that our file name is callbyref.c.
This is our header file as stdio.h.
Then we have function swap.
This function will exchange the values of the variables.
Value of 'a' will be stored in value of 'b' and vice versa.
You can see that the arguments passed in the function are pointer type.
Here we have declared an integer variable t.
"""First, value of 'a' is stored in 't'."""
Then value of 'b' is stored in 'a'.
And then value of 't' is stored in 'b'.
"""Like this, the values are exchanged."""
Here we have declared two integer variables as i and j.
Then we take the values of i and j as user inputs.
Ampersand i (&i) and Ampersand j (&j) will give the memory address of i and j.
"""First, we print the values before swapping."""
Then we call the function swap.
And then we print the values after swapping.
Switch back to our terminal.
To compile type gcc space callbyref dot c space hyphen o space ref. Press Enter.
Now type dot slash ref. Press Enter.
"""We see, 'Enter the values'. I will enter as 6 and 4."""
The output is displayed as: Before swapping 6 and 4
After swapping 4 and 6.
Now let us see how to execute the same program in C++.
"""I have the code, lets go through it."""
"""This is the second program, function call by reference ."""
Note that our file name is callbyref.cpp
Let us go through the code.
This is our header file as iostream .
Here we are using the std namespace.
The function declaration is same in C++.
In this we pass the arguments as ampersand x and ampersand y.
This will give the memory address of x and y.
Then we swap the values.
Rest of the code is similar to our C code.
The printf statement is replaced by cout and the scanf statement is replaced by cin.
Now let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile type, g++ space callbyref.cpp space hyphen o space ref1, press Enter."""
"""Now, type  dot slash ref1. Press Enter."""
Here it is displayed as:
Enter values of a and b
I will enter as 4 and 3.
The output is displayed.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Let us go back to our slides.
"""Let us summarize, In this tutorial we learnt:"""
Function call by value.

The questions in the first page are highlighted in the Quiz navigation block.
I will begin attempting questions in both the sections.
"""There are buttons for previous and next pages, depending on which page you are in."""
Let me attempt the questions.
"""I can go back to any question if I need to review it, from the Quiz navigation block."""
"""On the left of the question, notice that there is an option to flag the question."""
A flagged question has a red triangle at the top right of the question.
"""One can flag a question in order to Go back and review it later, before submitting the attempt Or to discuss the topic with the teacher"""
The question will remain flagged until the student specifically removes the flag.
There are some other markers related to quiz questions.
A grey marker indicates an answered question.
A small red triangle below the question number indicates an incomplete answer.
A totally white box indicates an unanswered question.
"""As mentioned earlier, I can click on any question to go back to that question."""
"""When I am done, I will click on Finish attempt... link in the Quiz navigation block."""
I can also click on Finish attempt button at the end of the quiz.

"""Now, click on Attempts link."""
"""There are some filters at the top of the page, which are self-explanatory."""
You can use these if there are many students enrolled in your course.
I will leave them as they are and scroll down.
Let me close the navigation menu on the left for better view.
Notice that all the attempts are listed in a table here.
Click on Review attempt link below Priya Sinha’s name.
You may see a different set of questions than the ones I see.
"""That is because we added random questions from the question bank, while creating the quiz."""
"""The students will see different questions or a different order of questions, when they attempt."""
We can see a brief overview of the attempt.
Priya Sinha finished the quiz in 3 minutes and 12 seconds.
She also got 1.2 out of 4 marks and 30%.
This will give you an idea of how the student performed in the quiz.
Look at the Quiz navigation block at the right.
The green box with a tick mark indicates that the student got full marks for the answer.
The red box indicates that the student answered the question incorrectly.
The brown box with a white circle in between indicates partially correct answer.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Report Writing in LaTeX. I am calling it “latek” and not “latex”.
My name is Kannan Moudgalya.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to write a document."""
"""In particular, how to use ‘report’ and ‘article’ class, How to create sections, Automate the numbering of sections, Create Table of contents and How to create the title page."""
"""I am creating this tutorial on our less than 10,000 Rupee laptop."""
"""And, I am using Ubuntu Linux, TeXworks and LaTeX."""
You can also use TeXworks on Windows or Mac - the method is identical.
"""You can use LaTeX by itself, without TeXworks also."""
You are welcome to use more expensive Linux computers also!
"""The prerequisites to learn this are the following: Spoken tutorials that introduce LaTeX, The file ‘report dot tex’, Knowledge of the side-by-side method required to practise this tutorial."""
Information on all of the above are available on our website: spoken tutorial dot org.
Let me go to the TeXworks window.
I have already opened the file report.tex. Please download this file and practise along with me.
"""I am using 12 point as the font size, ‘a4 paper’ and ‘article’ class."""
"""I am using the geometry package to set margins, through the 'usepackage' command."""
A reverse slash should come at the beginning of every command.
"""Although I will not say it explicitly, you should not forget to put the reverse slash."""
"""Similarly, I will not explicitly mention braces, but you may have to use them."""
Please reproduce exactly what is done in the video.
The usepackage command has optional parameters inside square brackets.
The name of the package is within braces.
I have set horizontal and vertical margins of 4.5 cm each.
Look at the top left hand corner of the 'TexWorks’ window.
"""In case 'pdfLaTeX’ is not already chosen, please select it from the pull down menu."""
"""To the left, there is a green circle with an arrow."""
Click the arrow and compile this file.
We get the file ‘report.pdf’ shown on the right hand side.
"""Look at the titles - section, sub-section and sub-sub-section in the output file."""
These are created using identical commands given in the source file.
Observe the distinctive features of these section titles in the 'pdf' file.
The sizes of these titles are created proportionately and automatically.
"""Also, the section title is the largest and the sub-sub-section title is the smallest."""
"""Irrespective of blank lines in the source file, the output remains the same."""
Let me delete one line here. Compile.
There is no change here.
Let me now change the paper size to a5.
This will reduce the width of every line in the output.
Let me compile the text as we did before.
Let me magnify it by pressing control + so that you can see the output clearly.
Let me bring it to the centre.
"""For the rest of this tutorial, we will use the a5 paper only.  You are welcome to change it to a4."""
Note that I did not save the file. This is because TexWorks saves the file automatically before compilation.
Let us change the font to a smaller one of 10 point and compile.
"""Hey, the font size has become smaller - should we be surprised?  But, proportional sizing and spacing remain the same."""
Let me change the font back to 12 point.
We will now discuss another important aspect of section titles.
It is the automatic generation of section numbers.
"""To illustrate this further, I will add a new section called ‘Inserted section’."""
"""On compilation, it appears here with a correct number in sequence. Thus, numbering also is automatically taken care of by LaTeX."""
LaTeX creates table of contents through a file with extension “toc”.
"""Let me add ‘table of contents’, one word, here."""
Compile.
The word ‘Contents’ appears in the output but nothing else.
Let me compile once again.
All the titles are now present in the table of contents along with page numbers.
You have to compile it the third time to get the correct page numbers.
Why three times? Please see the assignment.
"""Just one word, ‘table of contents’, is what is needed."""
What an amazing capability in LaTeX!
This is achieved through a file with extension “toc” that LaTeX maintains.
This multi pass compilation procedure works with changes in titles as well.
Let me change the section title to ‘Modified section’.
Let me compile it. Table of Contents does not change.
Let me compile it once more and solve this problem.
Now we have a modified section here.
"""We will create a title for this document. Let me do it here, just before ‘begin document’."""
"""I will create a ‘title’, ‘Author’ information and the ‘date’ as follows."""
"""So, I have added these three commands."""
Order in which these come or the place where they come does not matter.
But they should come before the begin document command.
Don’t forget the reverse slash in all the commands.
Double slash here means the next line. We compile it.
There are no changes in the ‘pdf’ file.
The reason is that I have not told LaTeX what to do with this information.
"""So, I add the ‘make title’ command, one word, just after the 'begin document'."""
Let me compile it.
"""The title appears in the output, at the place where I put this command"""
"""namely, at the beginning of the document."""
We will now change the class of this document from article to report.
"""Simultaneously, we define a chapter with this command: 'Chapter First Chapter'."""
Report style requires at least one chapter.
Let us compile it and see the output.
Notice the changes in the output.
Title appears on a whole page that has no number.
"""Contents also appear on an entire page, with page number 1."""
Please pause here and find out how many entries in 'Contents' are wrong.
Let us go to the next page. Notice the way the chapter begins.
How many distinguishing features can you identify? You should find at least five.
Let us compile it for the second time.
Observe that the Contents page now has the correct information. The page numbers are correct now.
"""Let us add a chapter, called ‘New Chapter’."""
Compile it.
Let me compile once again and see it coming on a new page.
Insert the command appendix before this new chapter.
"""On compilation, you see the word “Appendix” appearing."""
The chapter number is A.
Let us go to the slides now.
Let us summarize what we learnt in this tutorial.
"""Writing a document in LaTeX, Automatically creating chapter and section titles, Automatic numbering, Table of contents and title page creation,  Creating Appendix."""
Let me give some assignments.
This assignment is on a4 paper and letter paper.
"""Please pause the video, read the slide and do the assignment."""
This assignment is on font size.
This is on report dot toc.
This is on number of compilations.
This is on the location of Table of Contents.
This assignment is on the use of the 'chapter' command in 'report' and 'article'.
This assignment is on the effect of the 'appendix' command in the 'report' class.
"""This is the same as the previous assignment, but in the 'article' class."""
This is on the geometry package.
"""This assignment is on LaTeX classes, in general."""
"""With this, we have come to the end of this tutorial."""

"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
Now let's start with today's tutorial.
It's about Curves.
Let me first activate the Curves tool in the tool box and then click in the image.
"""You can see, there is a histogram in the Curves tool and here are two bars with a gray scale."""
"""Then there are some buttons to select in the Curves tool like Preview, Save, Open etc."""
"""But for now, we will concentrate on the gray scale bar of the Curves tool."""
This bar here shows the different colour range of the source image.
"""And in this bar, we have some pixels which are really dark and some pixels which are really bright and in between there are pixels from dark to light."""
This horizontal bar here consists of 256 different colour tones.
The initial point on this bar is zero which is black and on end point it’s 255 which is white.
"""And for example, this here 184 is gray."""
This image consists lot of colours and I can show you the different colours here by changing the Channel.
Let’s select red in the colour Channel and you can see the red tones in the image.
"""Similarly, you can change it to green and blue to get the respective tones."""
"""And in this image, it’s not very surprising that the green channel is dominant channel which has lot of values in it."""
Now click on Reset Channel.
The curve of the histogram above each tone is the count of the pixel which have luminosity.
And we have an area here where there are almost same number of pixels with this terminal and this terminal on the bar.
The histogram shows that here is the highest colour range.
"""You go into the image when the Curves tool is active and the mouse cursor changes to a little dropper. When I click here, the line in the histogram shifts to that point."""
You can click into the image and move around to know which tone is where in the image.
Now we have covered horizontal bar here.
"""And this, here, is the output."""
And here are also 256 different values and they form the image.
Horizontal bar contains the data which is put into the curve and vertical bar contains data that is put out.
This line in between which crosses the graph is the translation function.
When I go up from mid gray to the translation curve and then when I go to the vertical bar on left I hit again to mid gray.
I can pull this curve as I want to and when I pull it down you see that the image gets darker.
"""And now when I go up from mid gray to the curve and then go to left, I land at dark gray."""
You see it here that the lower bar here is the original input and the vertical bar is the output of the Curves tool.
I can change this curve in lot of different ways which has nearly no limits.
One limit is that I can’t pull the curve backwards and the moment I do that the point on the Curves tool is lost.
"""But, if I don’t want to see any bright pixels in the image, so I can pull all the points down and then the image is nearly black."""
Just pull this point up here and you can get some bright stuff here.
You can play around with the Curves tool until you get images that have been in fashion for years ago.
We can restart the curve by clicking on the Reset button and get the original curve.
There are some more buttons in the Curves tool like Linear Mode and Logarithmic Mode.
"""In Logarithmic mode, you get the smaller values pushed up."""
"""Here in Linear mode, this line has double value from this line here."""
"""In Logarithmic mode this line can be 1, this 10, this 100 and this 1000."""
Each step gives you 10 times more value and with this you see the small pixels which in Linear mode are hidden.
you see it in this corner; you can’t say if there are pixels which have value more than 250.
"""But in Logarithmic, you see we have pixels over the full range of the image."""
"""Then here, there is a button called Curve Type. Up to now I used the tool here where the curve gets the curve and when I change the curve type, I can actually paint the curve and get some really funny stuff"
Then there is Save dialog and Open dialog button.
When you finish with changing the curves you can save it for later use and recall it whenever you want to.
I know a guy who shoots weddings a lot and he has a special bright shot curve which is fine tuned in white to give structure to the white dress.
How do I use Curves tool in this image?
I want to get the dark part of the image a bit darker.
I want to keep the mid terms as it is and I want to have bright part a bit brighter.
"""And to do this, I think, I will use the ‘S’ curve."""
I just pull the curve in the lower part a bit down and you can see that the dark part gets darker and I go to the bright part and push the curve up and make the bright part brighter.
You can pull the curve a bit up for more brightness.
"""When I click OK, the values of the curves are stored."""
"""And when I repeat this process here, you can see that the histogram has changed."""
"""There are no values in between here with no pixels and when I click on Logarithmic mode, there also you can see no values for certain pixels."""
"""Each time when you use Curves tool, you lose some pixels in the image."""
"""So, don’t try to undo the curve operation by doing the opposite i.e by pulling the curve up here and pulling down here."""
Click OK and now you can see that it gets worst and worst and you end in a image with a colour banding.
"""So, use the curves tool only to make one change and use it with care. Otherwise you end up losing the pixels in the image and you get an image colour banding in it."""
I think this was it for this tutorial.
And I hope to see you around for the next tutorial.

The Spoken Tutorial Project is funded by MHRD Government of India.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Relational Operators in Java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the"""
"""boolean data type,Relational operators and"""
how to compare data using Relational operators.
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of data types in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our  website as shown."""
Relational operators are used to check for conditions.
Their output is a variable of boolean data type.
A   boolean data type is of size  1 bit.
It stores only two values.
true or false.
true is the output when the condition is true.
false is the output if the condition is not true.
Here is a list of the relational operators available.
greater than
less than equal to
greater than or equal to less than or equal to
not equal to
We shall look into each of them in detail.
Switch to Eclipse.
Here we have the Eclipse IDE and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
I have created a class BooleanDemo and added the Main method.
Now let us add some expressions.
Type boolean b ;
The keyword boolean declares the data type of the variable b as boolean.
We shall store the result of our condition in b.
We shall define a variable weight and check for a condition using that variable.
int weight  equal to 45;
We shall check if the value in weight is greater than 40.
b  equal to weight  greater than 40;
This statement says: check if the value of variable is greater than 40 and store the result in 'b'.
"""Now, let us print the value of 'b'."""
System  dot  out dot  println(b);
"""As we can see, the output is True."""
Let us see what happens if the value is less than 40.
Change weight to 30.
Save and run.
We can see that the output is False as expected.
"""This way, the greater than symbol is used to check if one value is greater than the other."""
"""Similarly, less than symbol is used to check if one value is less than the other."""
Let us change the greater than to less than symbol.
"""So, We are checking if the value of weight is less than 40."""
"""Save, Run."""
"""As we can see, the output is true as expected."""
Let us change the value of weight to 45 and see the output.
We see that we get a false because the condition
weight less than 40 is not true.
Now let us see how to check if a value is equal to another.
"""To do that, we use two equal to symbols."""
Change less than symbol to double equal to.
"""As we can see, the output is false because the value of weight is not equal to 40."""
Now let us change the weight to 40 and see the output.
Save and  Run.
"""As we can see, the output is True."""
"""This way, double equal to is used for checking equality."""
"""Please be careful because, often people use a single equal to symbol for checking equality."""
And this gives unnecessary errors.
Next we'll see how to check for less than or equal to.
"""To do that, we will use a less than symbol followed by an equal to symbol."""
"""Change the double equal to,  to less than equal to."""
The output is True as expected.
Now let us change the value of weight to see if the less than check is performed.
Change 40 to 30.
"""We see, that although the weight is not equal to 40 we get the output as True because it is less than 40."""
Let us see what happens if the value of weight is greater than 40.
Let's say 50. Save and Run.
"""As we can see, the output is False   because the value of weight is not equal to 40."""
And it also not less than 40.
"""Similarly, we use a greater than symbol followed by an equal to symbol for checking greater than or equal to."""
Let us try it.
Change less than equal to to greater than equal to.
"""As we can see, the output is true  because weight is greater than 40."""
Let us change weight to a value less than 40. Let's say 30.
We get a false because the value of weight is not greater than 40 and also not equal to 40.
"""Next, we’ll see how to check for not equal to."""
It is done by using an exclamation mark followed by an equal to symbol.
Change greater than to exclamation.
"""So, this statement says: check if the value of weight is not equal to 40 and store the result in b."""
"""As we can see, the output is true because the values of weight is not equal to 40."""
Let us change the weight to 40 and see the output.
Change 30 to 40.
We get a false because the condition weight not equal to 40 is false.
The not equal to condition can be thought of as opposite of equal to condition.
This is how we use the various relational operators to compare data in Java.
"""In this tutorial we have learnt about: the boolean data type,"""
the relational operators and
how to use relational operators to compare data.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial, find out if the two expressions shown are equivalent."""

awk combines the power of a filter and a programming language.
"""So, it supports variables, constants, operators etc."""
Let’s see what a variable in awk is.
A variable is an identifier that references a value.
Awk supports both user-defined variables and built-in variables.
We will learn about user-defined variables in this tutorial.
"""For user-defined variables, variable declaration is not required."""
Variables do not have to be initialized explicitly.
Awk automatically initializes them to zero or null string.
"""A variable must begin with a letter and continue with letters, digits and underscores. Variables are case-sensitive."""
"""So, Salary with capital “S” and salary with small “s” are two different variables."""
Let us look at some examples now.
Open the terminal by pressing CTRL + ALT and T keys.
"""On the terminal, type- awk space opening single quote opening curly brace small x equal to 1 semicolon capital X equal to within double quotes capital A semicolon small a equal to within double quotes awk se"
"""Type: print x, press Enter."""
"""print capital X, press Enter."""
"""print a, press Enter."""
"""print b, press Enter."""
"""print a space b, press Enter."""
"""print small x space b, press Enter."""
print small x plus capital X closing curly brace closing single quote and press Enter.
"""Since we have not given a filename, awk would need some input from standard input."""
"""And hence, we can type any letter, say a and then press Enter."""
This example shows a couple of things. Variables can be initialized with a number.
It can also be initialized with value as a single character or a string.
"""If the value is a character or a string, variable is initialized with value within double quotes."""
We can see the values of the variables.
Observe that small x and capital X are treated as different variables.
This proves that variables are case sensitive.
"""Also, it shows how two strings can be concatenated."""
Here variables small a and small b are concatenated.
"""So, string concatenation operator is simply a space."""
"""Similarly, when we concatenate small x which is a number and string b, x is auto-converted into string. And the concatenated output becomes 1tutorial."""
Why does the auto-conversion to string happen?
"""That's because awk finds a string concatenation operator space here, between x and b."""
"""Now, look at the output of small x plus capital X. Here, we have the arithmetic operator plus."""
"""So, X is auto-converted to numeric zero. And the addition output becomes numeric 1."""
"""Until now, we have seen a couple of operators. Let’s look at what other operators we can use."""
A variety of operators can be used in expressions.
Please pause the video here and take a look at all the operators mentioned here.
I assume you are familiar with these basic operators.
"""If not, then kindly visit our website for tutorials on operators in C and C++ series."""
I am not going to discuss the working of all these operators in detail.
Only exception is the string matching operator which may be new to you. Let us understand this with an example.
A file named awkdemo.txt has been provided in the Code files link. Please download it on your computer.
Switch to the terminal. Let us end the previous process by pressing Ctrl and D keys.
Let me clear the terminal.
"""Now, go to the folder in which you have saved the awkdemo.txt file using the cd command."""
Let us have a look at this file now.
Let's say we want to find the students who have passed but have marks less than 80.
"""In this case, we need to compare two different fields."""
"""For such situations, we can use awk's relational operators."""
These operators can compare both strings and numbers.
"""So, on the terminal, type: awk space hyphen capital F within double quotes vertical bar space within single quotes dollar 5 equal to equal to within double quotes Pass space ampersand ampersand space dollar"
"""This command shows a number of things. One, we compare a string with the fifth field."""
"""Second, we only compare the fourth field with a number."""
"""Third, we see that we can join two or more comparisons using ampersand operator."""
"""Instead of specific numbers or strings, we can also compare regular expressions."""
"""As we have seen in the slide, we have the tilde and the exclamation tilde operators for this purpose."""
"""Now suppose, we want to find computer science students who have passed."""
"""Since computers can have both a small and capital C, we would use a regular expression."""
We would type: awk space hyphen capital F within double quotes pipe symbol space within single quote dollar 5 equal to equal to within double quotes Pass ampersand ampersand space dollar 3 tilde slash within
"""If we want to negate the comparison, we can do so using the exclamation tilde operator."""
"""Say, now we want a list of all non-computer students who have passed."""
Use the up-arrow to get the previous command.
Next to dollar 3 add exclamation symbol and press Enter.
"""Next, let's count the number of blank lines in the same file."""
"""Open the file and check how many blank lines are there. So, it has 3 blank lines."""
"""Now to count the number of empty lines using awk, type: awk space within single quote within front slash caret symbol dollar space within curly braces x equal to x plus 1 semicolon space print x space awkdem"
We got 3 as our final answer.
The caret sign signifies start of a line while dollar signifies the end of a line.
"""Hence, an empty line would be matched by the regular expression caret-dollar."""
"""Note, we have not initialized the value of x. Awk has initialized x to the initial value zero."""
"""This command gives us the running count of blank lines. This is because, every time a blank line is found, x would be incremented and then printed."""
"""In our last command, we have seen running count of blank lines. But, say we only want to print the total number of blank lines."""
"""Then we need to print x only once, after the entire file has been traversed."""
We may also want to give a heading saying what the output means.
"""For such requirements, awk provides the BEGIN and the END sections."""
The BEGIN section contains procedures for pre-processing.
This section is executed before the main input loop is executed.
The END section can contain procedures for post-processing.
This section is executed after the main input loop has terminated. The BEGIN and END procedures are optional.
"""Let's learn how to do this. In the terminal, type: awk space opening single quote BEGIN in caps within curly brace print space within double quotes The number of empty lines in awkdemo are  press Enter."""
within front slash caret symbol dollar symbol space within curly braces x equal to x plus 1  press Enter.
end space within curly braces print space x close single quote space awkdemo.txt and press Enter.
"""See, we did not get the desired output! We should get the output as 3 because we have 3 blank lines in the file."""
"""What do you think happened? Actually, we should have written end as upper case END."""
"""So, let us modify the command."""
Press the up-arrow key to get the previous executed command on the terminal.
"""Now, modify lower case end to upper case END.  And press Enter."""
Now the total number of empty lines is displayed in the output.
"""Next, let's find the average salary of all the students that we found in the awkdemo.txt file."""
"""To get that, type the command as shown in the terminal and press Enter. And, we get the desired output."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: User defined variables in awk,"""
"""Operators,  BEGIN and END statements."""
"""As an assignment, print every line where the value of the last field is more than 5000. And, the student belongs to Electrical department."""
Print the average marks of all the students with the heading “Average marks” in the output.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on parameterized constructor in java.
In this tutorial we will learn:
About a parameterized constructor.
And to create a parameterized constructor.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 OS Java Development kit  1.6 And  Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create a default constructor in java using eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown.http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
What is a parameterized constructor?
A constructor that has parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
It can have one or more than one parameters.
Let us now create a parameterized constructor.
"""So in the eclipse, I have   Student.java file."""
We created this file in the previous tutorial.
"""Now, inside the constructor we will give the variables their default value."""
So roll_number is equal to zero instead of ten.
And name is equal to null instead of Raman.
"""Then type System dot out dot println """"I am a  default constructor""""."""
"""So, we have created a constructor with no parameters."""
"""In java, such constructor is also called a default constructor."""
Now we will create another constructor.
"""So, type: Student parentheses."""
Inside parenthesis int the_roll_number comma String the_name.
"""So, what we have done is declared a constructor with parameters."""
The name of the constructor is  Student that is the class name.
"""Inside the parentheses, we have given two parameters to the constructor."""
We can give any number of parameters to the constructor.
"""Now, inside curly brackets type:"""
"""System dot out dot println """"I am a parameterized constructor""""."""
"""Then, roll_number is equal to the_roll_number."""
And name is equal to the_name.
"""So, we have created a   constructor with parameters."""
Now let's call this  constructor.
"""So, in the main method type: student stu2 equal to new student within parentheses 11 comma in double quotes Raju."""
Let's call the studentDetail  method.
"""So, type: stu2.studentDetail."""
We see the output on the console.
The default constructor is called first.
It initializes the variables to their default values.
Then the parameterized constructor is called.
It initializes the variables to the values that are passed as the arguments.
That is 11 and Raju.
Let us see how the parameterized constructor works.
"""When we call the parameterized constructor, we pass two values  to it."""
These are called arguments.
The value 11 is copied to the parameter the_roll_number.
And  the  value Raju is copied  to the parameter the_name.
Then the value of the_roll_number is assigned to roll_number.
And the value of the_name is assigned to name.
"""Hence,  in the  output  we see 11  and  Raju."""
Let us see the common errors when we call a parameterized constructor.
"""Suppose, we pass a single argument to the constructor."""
So remove Raju.
We get an error. It states that “The constructor Student with parameter (int) is undefined.”
"""So, the number of arguments must match the number of parameters."""
Here we can retype Raju and resolve the error.
"""Alternatively, what we can  do is define another constructor with a single parameter."""
Let us  do that.
"""So, Student within parentheses int r_ number."""
"""Inside curly brackets, type:   System dot out dot println"""
"""""""I am a constructor with a single parameter""""."""
Then roll_number is equal to r_ number.
Save the file.
We see that the error is resolved  when we define the constructor.
Let's  Run the program.
On the console we see that the roll number is assigned the value 11.
While name is null since the constructor takes only one argument.
Let us now call back our constructor with two parameters.
"""So, type Student stu3 is equal to new Student."""
11 comma Raju.
Then Stu3 dot studentDetail.
"""Suppose here we pass 11 as String,so add double quotes."""
We get an error.
It states that “The constructor Student String comma String is undefined.”
So even the data type of the argument must match with that of the parameter.
So now remove the quotes and Save the file.
Now we do not see an error.
So  Run the program.
In the output we see three constructors.
The first one is the default constructor.
The second one is the Constructor with one parameter.
And this third one is the Constructor with two parameters.
This is how we create parameterized constructor in java.
Why constructor?
The variables in a class must be initialized each time an instance is created.
It can be tedious to initialize all the variables.
"""So, java allows objects to initialize themselves when they are created."""
This is performed through the use of a constructor.
"""So in this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
To create parameterized constructor.
Functionality of parameterized constructor.
And the advantage of using constructor.
"""For self assessment, create a class Employee."""
Create constructors with different number of parameters.
"""It is supported by the National mission on Education through ICT, MHRD, Government of India."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Admin’s dashboard in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: various blocks on the Admin’s dashboard,  Admin’s profile page and how to edit preferences."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04, Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30, Moodle 3.3  and Firefox web browser."""
You may use any web browser of your choice.
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
"""Learners of this tutorial should have Moodle 3.3 installed on their system. If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and open your moodle site. Make sure that the XAMPP service is running.
You can see a blank page with only the headers.  This is because we have not set any front page for our installation.
Click on Log in link at the top right corner of the window.
Log in using your admin username and password that you had given when you installed Moodle.
I will enter admin as the username and Spokentutorial1@ as the password.  Then click on Log in button.
The page that we see now is called the dashboard.
We can see that our dashboard is divided into 2 columns.
"""The wider one on the left, is the main Content column."""
The one on the right is the Blocks column.
Blocks are items in these columns that serve a specific purpose or information.
Blocks are found on all pages of Moodle. You can think of them as shortcuts to critical parts of your course.
"""For eg. Private Files, Online Users, Course Overview etc. are the blocks on my dashboard."""
Notice that there are no activities or courses here.
This is because we have not created any course yet.
A list of all courses will be seen- if a user (i.e a teacher or student or admin)  is enrolled or assigned a role in courses.
Also notice that the Online Users block shows Admin User which is our current login.
This block shows all the  logged in users at any given point of time.
Every block in Moodle has a specific purpose. We can add blocks to any column of any page in Moodle.
Let us now look at the header of the page.
"""On the top left corner, we can see a Navigation Drawer or Navigation menu. This helps us to access Calendar and other Administration links. This is a toggle menu"""
which means it changes its status from open to close and vice-versa when clicked.
We then have the placeholder for the logo.
"""By default, this is the short site name. Clicking on this, will get us to the dashboard from any page."""
"""At the top right, there are quick access icons for notifications and messages."""
Next to that is the drop-down user menu.  It is also called the quick access user menu.
"""We will discuss the Profile and Preferences page in brief, in this tutorial."""
"""All these menu items are also toggle menus, similar to the one on the left."""
"""Next, click on the Profile link."""
Every user in Moodle has a profile page.
"""It has links to   allow users to edit their profile information, view their forum or blog posts,"""
check any reports they have access to and view their access logs and the IP address that was used to login the last time.
Now let’s click on the Edit Profile link. The Edit Profile page opens up.
"""This page is divided into 5 sections: General, User Picture, Additional Names, Interests, Optional."""
"""The General section is expanded, by default."""
Clicking on any section name expands or collapses it.
"""The ‘Expand all’ link on the right, expands all the sections."""
All fields here are editable.
Let’s add City / Town. I will type Mumbai.
"""Ensure that India is selected in the Select a country drop-down. And, timezone is set to Asia/Kolkata."""
Only Admins can change password from this profile page.
Let me add a few fields in the Optional section.
"""I will enter IIT Bombay in the Institution field. Also, Mathematics in Department and a valid phone number in the Phone number field."""
Then click on Update Profile button to save the page.
"""Now, click on the quick access user menu at the top right, again. Click on the Preferences link."""
The Preferences page gives users quick access to various settings they may wish to edit.
"""Preferences page for an admin account is divided into 4 sections: User account, Roles, Blogs, and  Badges."""
The User Account section allows the user  to Edit Profile and Change Password.
"""It also sets preferences for Language, Forum, Calendar, Message, Notification etc."""
Let’s click on the Calendar preferences.
We will set the calendar to display time in 24 hour format.
"""Also, we will set the Upcoming events look-ahead to 2 weeks."""
This means we’ll see notifications for all events happening in the next 2 weeks on the calendar.
I want to highlight the help icon next to all the fields.
"""Clicking on this, will open a help box with a short description of what the field stands for."""
"""When in doubt about any field, always click on the help icon to understand its significance."""
Let all the other options remain as they are. Click on Save Changes button.
We will go through the rest of the preferences when we discuss those features later in this series.
Notice the information here.
"""This is the breadcrumb navigation. It’s a visual aid that indicates which page we are on, within the Moodle site’s hierarchy."""
It helps us to go back to a higher-level page with a single click.
Click on the Dashboard link in the breadcrumbs to go to the dashboard.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: various blocks on the admin’s dashboard, Admin’s profile page and how to edit preferences."""
Here is a small assignment for you. Click on the Message Preferences. Users in Moodle can send private messages to each other.
"""I do not want my messages to be delivered as email, even when I am offline."""
Look at the online and offline help box and ensure that the settings are correct.
"""Spoken Tutorial Project is funded by NMEICT, MHRD, Government of India.. More information on this mission is available at the link shown."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Conditional statements in C and C++.
In this tutorial we will learn:
How to execute a single statement
How to execute group of statements.
We will do this through examples.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10 gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with the introduction to conditional statements.
A statement in a program controls the flow of program execution.
It helps to make decision on what code is to be executed.
"""We can check the conditions, whether true or false."""
We can execute a single statement or a group of statements.
Let us understand the flow of if statements.
"""Here, if the condition is true then statement 1 will be executed."""
If the condition is false then statement 2 will be executed.
Now we will see the flow of else if statement.
"""Here, if condition 1 is true then statement 1 will be executed."""
If condition 1 is false then it will check for another condition that is condition 2.
If condition 2 is true then statement 3 will be executed.
And If condition 2 is false then statement 2 will be executed.
Now Let us move on to our program.
I have already typed the code on the editor.
"""So, let me open it."""
Note that our file name is ifstmt.c.
In this program we will calculate the sum of two numbers and will check a few conditions.
Let me explain the code now.
This is our header file.
This is our main() function.
"""Here we have declared three integer variables a, b and sum."""
Here we are asking for user input.
User will enter the values of a and b.
The values will be stored in variable a and variable b.
The scanf() function reads data from the console.
It then stores the result in the given variable.
The format specifier in the scanf() helps to know the type of data.
"""Like here we have %d, it denotes that we are dealing with integer data type."""
Here we add the values of a and b.
We will store the result in sum.
Then we print the result.
This is our if statement.
"""Here, we check the condition whether sum is greater than 20."""
"""If the condition is true, then we print Sum is greater than 20."""
Now let me comment out these lines.
This is our return statement.
Now click on Save.
First we will see the execution of if statement.
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space ifstmt dot c space  -o space if and press Enter."""
"""To execute,  type ./if (dot slash if). Press Enter."""
It is displayed as Enter the values of a and b.
I will give the values as 10 and 12.
The output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 22. Sum is greater than 20.
Now come back to our program.
We will check another condition.
Let me remove the comment from here.
I will give the comment here.
This is our else-if statement.
"""Here, we check another condition whether Sum is greater than 10."""
If the condition is true then we print 'Sum is greater than 10 and less than 20'.
Now come back to our terminal.
Let us compile as before.
Let us execute as before.
It is displayed as Enter the value of a and b.
I will give the values as 10 and 2.
The output is displayed as: Sum of a and b is 12.
Sum is greater than 10 and less than 20.
Let me clear the prompt.
I will remove the comment from here and here. Now click on Save.
If both the above conditions are false then we print 'Sum is less than 10'.
This is our else statement.
Now let us execute and see.  Come back to our terminal.
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.
Here it is displayed as Enter the value of a and b.
I will give the values as 3 and 5.
The output is displayed as sum of a and b is 8. Sum is less than 10.
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across.
Come back to our program.
"""Suppose, here at the end of if statement I will type a semicolon (;)."""
Let us see what will happen. Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
We see an error:  'else' without a previous 'if'
Come back to our program. It is a syntax error.
if statement will never terminate with a semicolon.
And the else if statement will never work without an if.
Let us fix the error. Delete the semicolon (;) here.
Now Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to the terminal.
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.
Enter the value of a and b.
I will give the values as 3 and 6.
The output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 9. Sum is less than 10.
NOW WE WILL SEE HOW TO EXECUTE THE SAME PROGRAM IN C++.
I will change a few things here.
"""Press Shift, Ctrl and S  keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with an extension dot cpp and click on  Save.
We will change the header file as iostream.
Let us include the using statement here.
Now click on the Search for and replace text option.
Let us replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
Click on Replace all and click on Close.
Now delete the closing brackets here.
Replace the scanf() statement with the cin statement.
Type cin and two closing angle brackets >>. As we use cin >> function to read a line in C++.
Now delete the format specifiers.
Delete the comma and ampersand &.
Delete the comma here and type two closing angle brackets.
Again delete the ampersandand the closing brackets. Now click on Save.
Here delete the closing bracket and the comma.
Now delete the backslash n () and format specifier.
Now type two opening brackets.
Again type two opening angle brackets  and within the double quotes type backslash n “”.
Here also we will delete the closing bracket.
Now again delete the closing bracket here and here.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute.
Come back to the terminal. Let me clear the prompt.
"""To compile, type g++ space ifstmt.cpp space -o space if1"""
Here we have 'if1' because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter if for the file 'ifstmt.c'.
Now Press 'Enter'.To execute type ./if1 (dot slash if1) and press Enter.
Enter the value of a and b. I will give the values as 20 and 10.
The output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 30. Sum is greater than 20
Now come back to our slides.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learned 'if' statement eg. if(condition),"""
And 'else if' statement eg. else if(condition).
"""As an assignment, Write a program to check 'a' is greater than 'b' or less than 'b'."""
Hint: use 'if' statement.
"""Write another program to check which value is greater 'a', 'b' or 'c'."""
Hint: use 'else-if' statement.

Welcome to this tutorial on Introduction to Biopython.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: important features of Biopython"""
Information regarding download and installation on Linux Operating System and translation of a DNA sequence to a protein sequence using Biopython tools.
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics and basic Python programming."
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu OS version 12.04"" Python version 2.7.3 Ipython version 0.12.1 and Biopython version 1.58."
Biopython is a collection of modules for computational biology.
It can perform most basic to advanced tasks required for bioinformatics.
Biopython tools are used for:
"""Parsing, that is extracting information from various file formats such as FASTA, Genbank etc."""
"""Download data from database websites such as NCBI, ExPASY etc."""
Run Bioinformatic algorithms such as BLAST.
It has tools for performing common operations on sequences.
"on, translation etc."""
Code for dealing with alignments and code to split up tasks into separate processes.
Information regarding download:
Biopython package is not part of the Python distribution; it needs to be downloaded independently.
"""For details, refer to the following link."""
Installation on Linux system:
"""Install Python, Ipython and Biopython packages using Synaptic Package Manager."""
Prerequisite software will be installed automatically.
Additional packages must be installed for graphic outputs and plots.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""I have already installed Python, Ipython and Biopython on my system."""
"""Start Ipython interpreter by typing """"ipython"""" and press Enter."""
IPython prompt appears on screen.
"""To check the installation of Biopython- at the prompt, type: """"import Bio"""",  press Enter."""
"""If you don't get any error message, it means Biopython is installed."""
"""Here, let me remind you, Python language is case sensitive."""
"""Take precaution while typing keywords, variables or functions."""
"""For instance, in the above line “i” in import is lowercase and “B” is uppercase in Bio."""
"""In this tutorial, we will make use of Biopython modules to translate a DNA sequence."""
It involves the following steps.
"""First, create a sequence object for coding DNA strand."""
"on of coding DNA strand to mRNA."""
"""Finally, translation of mRNA to a protein sequence."""
"""We will be using the coding DNA strand shown on this slide, as an example."""
It codes for a small protein sequence.
The first step is to create a sequence object for the above coding DNA strand.
Let us go back to the terminal.
"""For creating a sequence object, import the Seq module from Bio package."""
The Seq module provides methods to store and process sequence objects.
"""At the prompt, type: from Bio dot Seq import Seq  press Enter."""
"""Next, specify the alphabets in the strand explicitly, when creating your sequence object."""
That is to specify whether the sequence of alphabets code for nucleotides or amino acids.
"""To do so, we will use IUPAC module from Alphabet package."""
"""At the prompt, type: from Bio dot Alphabet import IUPAC.  Press Enter."""
"""Note that we have used import and from statements to load """"Seq"""" and """"IUPAC"""" modules."""
Store the sequence object in a variable called cdna.
"""At the prompt, type: cdna equal to Seq as in normal strings."""
Enclose the sequence within double quotes and parentheses.
"""We know our sequence is a DNA fragment. So, type: unambiguous DNA alphabet object as an argument."""
"""For the output, type: cdna. Press Enter."""
The output shows the DNA sequence as a sequence object.
Let’s transcribe the coding DNA strand into the corresponding mRNA.
We will use the Seq module's built-in “transcribe” method.
Type the following code:
Store the output in a variable mrna.
"""At the prompt, type: mrna equal to cdna dot transcribe open and close parentheses, press Enter."""
"""For the output, type:  mrna. Press Enter."""
Observe the output.The transcribe method replaces the Thiamin in the DNA sequence by Uracil.
"""Next, to translate this mRNA to corresponding protein sequence, use the translate method."""
Type the following code:  protein equal to mrna dot translate open and close parentheses. Press Enter.
"""The translate method translates RNA or DNA sequence using the standard genetic code, if unspecified."""
The output shows an amino acid sequence.
The output also shows information  regarding the presence of stop codons in the translated sequence.
Observe the asterisk at the end of the protein sequence. It indicates the stop codon.
"on."""
"""In Biopython, transcribe method works only on coding DNA strand."""
"on starts with a template strand."""
"""If you are starting with a template strand, convert it to coding strand by using reverse complement method, as shown on the terminal."""
"""Follow the rest of the code as shown above, for the coding strand."""
Using methods in Biopython we have translated a DNA sequence to a protein sequence.
DNA sequence of any size can be translated to a protein sequence using this code.
"""Let's summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
Important features of Biopython
Information regarding download and installation on Linux OS
Create a sequence object for the given DNA strand.
on of the DNA sequence to mRNA.
Translation of mRNA to protein sequence.
"""Now, for the assignment-"""
Translate the given DNA sequence into protein sequence.
Observe the output.
The protein sequence has an internal stop codon.
"""As it happens in nature, translate the DNA till first in-frame stop codon."""
Your completed assignment should have the following code.
Notice that we have used to underscore stop argument in the translate() method. Notice the output.
The stop codon itself is not translated.
The stop symbol is not included at the end of your protein sequence.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Create a 3-fold brochure” using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:"""
Use guidelines and to set them
Settings for a 3-fold brochure
Design a 3-fold brochure.
We will also learn the importance of using layers.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:"""
Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS
Inkscape version 0.48.4
"""This is a sample 3 fold brochure. As we open it, we can see the 3 folds."""
"""So, there are 6 sections in all."""
"""The outer side contains sections 1, 5 and 6."""
"""The inner side of the brochure contains sections 2, 3 and 4."""
Let us learn how to create a brochure like this one.
Open Inkscape.
Click on File and go to Document Properties.
Let's do some basic settings first.
Change: Default units to mm
Page Size to A4
Orientation to Landscape
Custom Size Units to mm.
We have to divide the canvas into 3 folds.
"""For that, observe that the width of the canvas is 297."""
"""So, we have to divide 297 into 3 parts which is 99 for each of the three sections."""
Close the Document Properties dialog box now.
Click and drag a guideline from the left side onto the canvas.
Double-click on this guideline.
A dialog box opens up.
Change the value of 'X' to 99 and click on OK.
Click and drag another guideline from the left side onto the canvas.
Double-click on it to open the dialog box.
"""Here, change the value of X to 198."""
Now our canvas is divided into 3 equal sections.
These guidelines tell us where each fold will start and end.
Let us save this file twice:
One for the inner side of the brochure
and the other for the outer side.
Go to File and click on Save as.
I will save the file on my Desktop with the name Brochure-OUT.svg.
Once again go to File and click on Save as.
"""This time, I will give the name Brochure-IN.svg and click on Save."""
"""So, now we have 2 files- one for the inner section and one for the outer section."""
Let us start with Brochure-IN.svg.
"""As we go about creating this brochure, it is desirable to use different layers for different elements."""
"""Towards the end of this tutorial, we see the benefits of doing so."""
"""Let us first design the inner sections of the brochure i.e. sections 2, 3 and 4."""
"""Using the Bezier tool, draw a graphic illustration in the middle of the canvas. Color it blue."""
Remove the stroke.
Create a new layer and name it as you prefer.
Create a circle of 150X150 pixels.
Color it green.
Duplicate the circle and create 5 more circles of different sizes as shown.
Place them around the graphic illustration as demonstrated.
"""Inside these circles, we will place some images."""
I have already edited the images to a circular shape and saved them in my Documents folder.
"""For your convenience, these images have been provided to you in the Code files link."""
"""Pause the tutorial, click on the link and save these images to your preferred location."""
"""After this, resume the tutorial."""
"""Go to File, click on Import and then on Image1."""
Keep it on top of the first circle.
"""In a similar way, repeat the steps for the other 5 images."""
Align them using Align and Distribute option.
"""Now, your canvas should look like this."""
Next create a new layer.
Select the Bezier tool and draw an arrow.
Color it gray.
Remove the stroke.
Go to Filters menu. Select Shadows and Glows and then click on Drop Shadow.
Check on Preview box to notice the effect.
Now click on Apply. Close the dialog box.
"""Keep it on the top of the first circle in an overlapping manner, as shown."""
Duplicate this arrow twice to create 2 more arrows.
"""Keep them on 2nd and 3rd circles respectively, as shown."""
"""Now, all the graphic elements are done."""
We will now insert the relevant texts.
"""On the new layer, type “Introduction” on the first arrow."""
Type Features on the second arrow.
Type Usage on the third arrow.
"""Now, we have to insert the text under each of these sections."""
I will copy and paste the texts from a LibreOffice Writer file that I have saved already.
This file is available to you in your saved folder.
Please locate it and copy the text from it.
Then paste it as shown on a new layer.
Reduce the font size to 15 and align them using Text and Font option.
Create a bullet of green color using the ellipse tool.
Place it to the right of the first sentence.
Repeat the same process for all the sentences.
Now the inner part of the brochure is ready.
Let's press CTRL + S to save our SVG file.
Now you can hide or show the layers that you want in the final brochure.
Let us now save the same file into PDF.
"""Go to File, click on Save As."""
Change the file extension to PDF.
Click on Save.
A new dialog box appears.
"""For printing purpose, the resolution must be 300."""
"""For web, it can be 72."""
Let me keep it as 300.
Now click on OK.
Let us now change the opacity of the arrows.
Go to the Arrow layer and change the opacity of the layer to 70.
I have also added a new layer with ink-blots.
Save the file in SVG and PDF formats.
Compare the 2 'pdf's to understand the difference.
"""Next, let us create the outer part of the brochure."""
Go to File. Click on Open.
Select Brochure-OUT.svg.
"""Now we have to design the sections 1, 5 and 6."""
"""Once again, remember to use different layers for different elements."""
Draw a graphic illustration on the top left using the Bezier tool as shown.
Color it blue. Remove the stroke.
Import Spoken Tutorial logo which is in your saved folder.
Reduce the size and place it on the top left corner of the 1st section.
Type Spoken Tutorial and align it to the right of the logo.
Change the font size to 25.
Draw a circle below the text and color it yellow.
Import Inkscape logo.
Place it on the top of the yellow circle.
Type “Inkscape” below the logo. Change the font size to 45.
I have added details about Spoken Tutorial project and inserted the relevant logos.
Please do so likewise.
I have aligned all the elements using
Text and font
and Align and Distribute options.
Now the outer side of the brochure is ready.
Go to File.  Click on Save As.
Change the format to SVG and click on Save.
Repeat the same process.
Change the extension to PDF.
This is our completed brochure.
If you have used layers for the various elements then you can conveniently change the colours and opacity.
These are 2 other colour schemes that I have created for the same brochure.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to:"""
Use guidelines and to set them
Design a 3-fold brochure.
We also learnt-the importance of using layers
and obtaining the same brochure in various colour schemes.
Here is an assignment for you-
Create a 3-fold brochure for Spoken Tutorial project.
Your completed assignment should look like this.
"""Spoken Tutorial Project is supported by the NMEICT, MHRD, Government of India."""
"""Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Using """"this"""" keyword in java."""
"""About use of """"this"""" keyword"""
"""To use """"this"""" keyword with fields"""
To use this keyword for chaining of constructors.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 jdk 1.6 Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
"""how to create a constructor in java, using eclipse."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
Now we will see the use of this keyword.
"""Within a constructor, """"this"""" is a reference to the current object."""
"""We can refer any member of the current object, within a constructor, using """"this""""."""
Now we will see the use of this keyword with fields.
this keyword helps us to avoid name conflicts.
We can see such an example here.
"""For that, let us open Eclipse."""
Open the Student class we had created in the earlier tutorial.
"""Comment the default constructor, comment the constructor with 1 parameter."""
Also comment the code for creating the first two objects.
"""Now, notice the parameterized constructor."""
the_roll_number and the_name are the arguments passed to the constructor.
roll_number and name are the instance variables.
"""Now, let me change the arguments to roll_number and name itself."""
So inside the constructor we have:
roll_number equal to roll_number and name equal to name.
"""Now Save and run the file. So press Ctrl, S and Ctrl, F11."""
We get the output as follows:
I am a parameterized constructor 0  null
Now come back to the code.
We see 2 warnings in the code.
Hover your mouse over the warning symbol.
We can see The assignment to the variable roll_number has no effect.
And The assignment to the variable name has no effect.
"""This is because, in the constructor, 'roll_number' and 'name' are local variables."""
Local variables are variables that are accessible within the method or block.
"""Here, 'roll_number' and 'name' will be initialized to 11 and """"Raju"""""""
"""because we have passed the values 11 and """"Raju"""" into the constructor."""
"""But once they come out of the constructor, it is not accessible."""
"""Then the only roll_number and name we know, are the instance variables."""
They have been initialized to '0' and null' already once the object is created.
So we got the output as 0 and null.
"""Now, let us make a small change inside the constructor."""
"""So, type: this dot roll_number equal to roll_number."""
"""And, this dot name equal to name."""
"""Now save and run the file. So press ctrl, S And Ctrl, F11 keys."""
We get the output as:
I am parameterized constructor 11 and Raju
This is because this dot roll_number and this dot name refer to the instance variables 'roll_number' and 'name'.
"""And here roll_number and name are the arguments, passed in the method."""
"""To avoid conflict between local and instance variables we use """"this"""" keyword."""
"""Now, we will see the use of """"this"""" keyword for chaining of constructor."""
We can use this keyword inside a constructor to call another one.
The constructors must be in the same class.
This is called explicit constructor invocation.
"""So, let us come back to the Student class which we created."""
Now remove the comments.
"""Now, comment the part to assign the instance variables to their values in the first two constructors."""
Then comment the part which creates the second and third objects.
"""Now, let us first come to the constructor with no parameters."""
After curly brackets type: this within brackets 11 and semicolon.
"""Inside the second constructor, type: this within brackets 11 comma within double quotes """"Raju"""" semicolon."""
"""Now, Save and Run the file. So, press Ctrl, S and Ctrl , F11."""
We get the output as:
I am a parameterized constructor
I am a constructor with a single parameter
I am Default Constructor 11 and  Raju
"""Now, I will explain the output."""
"""When the object is created, the respective constructor gets called."""
The constructor here is the no argument constructor.
The control comes to the first line in the constructor.
It encounters the this within brackets 11 statement.
Hence it calls the constructor that accepts single integer argument.
Then the control comes to this within brackets 11 comma Raju.
Hence it calls the constructor that accepts 1 integer and 1 String argument.
"""So, this constructor is executed and we get the output as I am a parameterized constructor."""
Now the instance variables will be initialized to 11 and Raju as we have passed.
"""Now, the control goes back to the calling constructor."""
"""So, the second constructor gets executed."""
We get the output as I am constructor with a single parameter.
"""Then, the control goes to the first constructor and executes it."""
"""So, we get output as I am a default constructor."""
Then studentDetail method is executed.
"""So, we get 11 and Raju."""
"""Now, let us make a small change."""
Make the this statement the last one in the constructor.
We get a compiler error.
Hover the mouse over the error symbol.
We get the error as:
Constructor call must be the first statement in a constructor.
"""So, we must make it the first line of the constructor."""
"""So, make it the first line of the constructor."""
Now we can see that the error has gone.
"""So, in this tutorial, we learnt:"""
The use of this keyword with fields.
To use this keyword for chaining constructors
How this keyword should be used within a constructor.
"""For self assessment, in the Employee class created earlier:"""
Create a constructor with two parameters.
Use this keyword to initialize the instance variables .
"""Also, create a constructor with 1 and no parameters."""
Try chaining the constructors using this as explained in the tutorial.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Instance fields in Java.
About instance fields
To access the instance fields of a class
Modifiers for instance fields
"""And, why instance fields are called so?"""
Here we are using:
Ubuntu version 11.10
jdk 1.6
And  Eclipse IDE 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create a class in Java using Eclipse.
You must also know how to create an object for the class.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
We know that objects store their individual states in fields.
These fields are declared without the  static  keyword.
We will learn about static fields in the coming tutorials.
Non-static fields are also known as instance variables or instance fields.
Let us go back to the Student class we had already created.
We can see that here roll_no and name are the instance fields of this class.
"""Now, we will learn how to access these fields."""
"""For that, let us open the TestStudent class which we had already created."""
We can remove the statement for creating the second object.
We will also remove the println statements.
"""Now we will access the fields, roll_no and name,  of the student class using stud1 and the dot operator."""
"""So, for that,  type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The roll number is then plus stud1 dot  from the option provided select ' roll_no' press Enter  then semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The name is plus stud1 dot select 'name' press Enter then semicolon."""
"""Now, save and run the file TestStudent.java. So press   Ctrl, S and Ctrl, F11."""
We get the output as:
The roll number is 0.
The name is null.
"""This is because, we have not initialized the variables to any value."""
"""In Java, the fields cannot have random values."""
"""After the memory is allocated for the object, the fields are initialized to null or zero."""
This work is done by the constructor.
We will learn about constructor in the coming tutorials.
"""Now, we will initialize the fields explicitly and see the output."""
"""So, type: int   roll_no equal to 50  next line String name equal to within double quotes Raju."""
"""Now, save and run the file. Press Ctrl, S and Ctrl, F11."""
We get the output as expected; The roll number is 50.
The name is Raju.
This is because we have explicitly initialized the variables  in the Student class.
We can see that here the fields have no modifier or  default modifier.
"""Recall modifiers, we had discussed in Creating Classes."""
We can access the fields because both Student.java and TestStudent.java are in the same package.
"""We can see that, here, they are in the same default package."""
We will learn about packages in the later tutorials.
We will now change the modifier to private.
"""So, before the field declarations, type: private. So, type: private space int roll_no=50;."""
"""Next line, private space String name = Raju;."""
Now save the file Student.java.
We can see that we get errors in TestStudent.java.
Hover the mouse over the error symbol.
It says The field Student  dot roll number is not visible.
And The field Student  dot name is not visible.
This is because private fields can be accessed only within its own class.
You can try accessing roll_no and name from the Student class itself.
You will find that you can access them without any error.
Now let us change the modifier to protected.
Now  Save the file and Run the program.
We see the output on the console. The Roll no is 50 The name is Raju.
This is because protected fields can be accessed within the same package.
Now let us see why  instance fields are called so?
Instance fields are called so because their values are unique to each instance of a class.
In other words each object of a class will have unique values.
Let us go back to the TestStudent class.
"""Here, we will create one more object of the Student class."""
"""So, type: next line, Student space stud2 equal to new space Student opening and closing brackets semicolon."""
We will now initialize both the objects in the TestStudent class.
"""So, next line, type: stud1 dot select roll_no  press  Enter equal to 20  semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: stud1 dot select  name press Enter equal to within double quotes Ramu  semicolon press Enter."""
Thus we have initialized the fields for the first object.
"""Now, we will initialize the fields for the second object."""
"""So, type: stud2 dot select roll_no equal to 30 semicolon."""
"""Next line, stud2 dot select name equal to within double quotes Shyamu  semicolon press Enter."""
"""Now, after the println statements, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The roll number is plus stud2  dot select roll_no and  semicolon."""
"""System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The name is, plus stud2  dot select name and semicolon."""
"""Now, save and run the file. Press  Ctrl, s and Ctrl, F11."""
"""We get the output as follows.  The roll_no is 20, The name is Ramu The roll_no is 30, The name is shyamu."""
"""Here, both stud1 and stud2 are referring to two different objects."""
This means that the two objects have unique values.
We can see that here.The first object has the values 20 and Ramu.
The second object has the values 30 and Shyamu.
"""Now, let us create one more object."""
So type Student space stud3 equal to new space Student  within brackets opening and closing brackets semicolon.
We will now print the values  of the third object.
"""So, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The  roll_no is plus stud3  dot select roll_no semicolon."""
"""next line, type:  System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The  name is plus stud3  dot name semicolon."""
"""Now, save and run the file. So press Ctrl, S and Ctrl, F11 ."""
We  can see that the third object contains the values 50 and Raju.
This is because we had explicitly initialized the fields of the Student class to 50 and  Raju.
"""Now, try de-initializing the fields and see the output for the third object."""
"""So in this tutorial, we learnt:"""
About instance fields.
Accessing the fields using dot operator.
"""For self assessment,"""
Create an  object emp2 in the TestEmployee class already created.
Then initialize the values of the two objects using dot operator.
Use 55 and Priya as values for first object.
Use 45 and Sandeep as values for second object.
Display the values for both the objects in the output.
Thus we have come to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on embedding mathematics in Xfig.
"""In this tutorial, I shall explain how to create this figure."""
Observe the mathematical expression in the second block.
You can embed any mathematical expression after learning this tutorial.
"""We shall create the figure in the previous slide, starting from this figure, which was created in the spoken tutorial on “Feedback Diagrams through Xfig”."""
You should learn this tutorial before starting the current one.
"""Let me now explain, what all you need to learn the material taught in this course."""
"""I am using Xfig Version 3.2, patch level 5."""
You also need LaTeX and a familiarity with it.
You also need image cropping software.
pdfcrop works on Linux and Mac OS X. We will cover it in this tutorial.
"""Briss is said to work on Windows also, but not covered in this tutorial."""
Let us go to Xfig.
"""Let us choose the File, then Open."""
"""If we scroll through the list, we will see the file “feedback.fig”, created in the spoken tutorial on “Feedback Diagrams through Xfig”. Let us click it."""
We will see the figure inside this box.
Let us open it.
Let us bring it inside.
Let us also zoom it.
"""Using the Save as option on “File”, we will save this figure as maths."""
Let us save it.
"""We now have the file """"maths.fig""""."""
Let us select “Edit” and click the text “Plant”.
Let me take the mouse here. Let me delete this and enter $G(z) = \frac z{z-1}$
Make sure that the mouse stays within the box while typing.
The default value for “Flag”' is “Normal” - change it to “Special”.
Click “Done”.
"""As the text is long, it overlaps with other entries."""
Let us move the text outside the box and work with it.
Let me click here.
Let me choose Grid Mode.
"""Once we are satisfied with any changes that we may want here, we can put it back inside the box."""
Let us save this file.
Let us export using combined pdf and Latex files.
File > Export > Combined pdf/LaTeX. Let us Export.
There is an error message that I get. But let us not worry about this.
Let me go to the terminal.
Let me type ls -lrt.
"""We get a list of files, with the last one being the most recent."""
The last two files are maths.pdf_t and maths.pdf.
Let us give the command open maths.pdf.
We can see the block diagram without the mathematical expression.
Let me close this.
Let us see maths.pdf_t in emacs editor that I have already opened.
It is here. Let me open it.
Please note that you do NOT have to use emacs.
You can use WHATEVER editor that you are comfortable with.
You can see  that the “picture” environment is used.
It also makes use of includegraphics and color packages – we need to tell LaTeX to take care of this requirement.
Let me now open the file maths-bp.tex; I have already created for this tutorial.
I have used article class.
"""I have used color and graphicx packages as these are used in the file pdf_t, the one we saw earlier."""
I want empty pagestyle as I do not want the page number.
"""Finally, I want to include the file maths.pdf_t."""
Let us invoke the command pdflatex maths-bp in the terminal.
We get the message that the maths-bp.pdf is created.
Let us open it with the command open maths-bp.pdf.
We have the file we want. Let me zoom it.
"""Now that we know that the mathematical expression is working, let us move the text inside the block."""
Let us save and export. It is already in the required language. Export.
Let us dismiss this warning.
Let me compile it again.
Let us click the pdf browser that has the file.
"""Now you see the mathematical expression inside the box, the way we want."""
Let us now see what happens if we do not choose the Special flag.
Let me come here.
"""Let me edit the text, change the Special Flag to Normal. Done."""
File > Save. Let me export.
Let me compile. Let me come here.
The formula is no longer in the form we want.
Let us change the “Special Flag” back to “Special”.
"""Save, Export."""
Recompile. You see that the file is in the form we want.
Let us now improve the appearance of this formula.
"""In this case, the use of 'dfrac' will make the fraction look better."""
"""In view of this, let us change 'frac' to 'dfrac'."""
Let me click here. Keep the mouse inside the box.
"""Put 'd' here. Done. Save, Export."""
Let us compile once again using pdflatex.
"""We get the error message “Undefined control sequence” """"\dfrac""""."""
LaTeX complains because the command \dfrac is defined in the package “Amsmath” but we have not included it.
We need to include it in the file maths-bp.tex'.
Let us do it. Let us go to emacs.
Enter “\usepackage{amsmath}”.
Let us save the file. Let us compile once again. Let me first exit.
Let me now recompile. Now it compiles. Let us click this.
We see that the fraction has now come out nicely.
We have now achieved our objective of learning how to embed mathematical expressions in Xfig.
It is important to note that Xfig does not interpret the LaTeX commands at all.
The interpretation is done by the “pdflatex” command.
The LaTeX commands have to be correct and consistent at the time of compilation.
We will now explain how to remove the white space around the figure.
Let me go to the terminal.
"""Let me type the command “pdfcrop maths-bp.pdf” - this is the file we created, into “maths-out.pdf”."""
"""Pdfcrop says, one page written on this file."""
"""“pdfcrop” takes an input file, trims the space around the figure and writes out the cropped file in the output file."""
“pdfcrop” is already installed in my system.
"""If you do not have it, you need to install it first."""
"""Let us view this output file by the command, “open maths-out.pdf”."""
Let me bring it inside.
The figure has now become extremely compact.
The white space that was here has been completely removed.
We can now insert this into documents.
Let me close this. Let me close this also. Let me close this also.
Let me come back to the slides.
The software “briss” can also be used to crop the white space.
"""It is supposed to work on Linux, Mac OS X and also on Windows."""
I have checked its working on Mac OS X. But we will not demonstrate it here.
We have now come to the end of this tutorial.
We have an assignment for you. Make the diagram created in this tutorial more symmetric and beautiful.
Try out different mathematical expressions.
"""Try out other options such as flip and rotate, not covered in the spoken tutorial."""
Try to build different diagrams. Explore the library.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Basics of single dimensional array in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about-  Arrays in awk,"""
"""assigning array elements,"""
how it is different from arrays in other programming languages and refer the elements of an array .
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
You can use any text editor of your choice.
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through previous awk tutorials on our website."""
You should have some basic knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
What is an array in awk? awk supports arrays for storing related elements.
Element can be a number or a string.
Arrays in awk are associative.
This means that each array element is an index-value pair.
It looks very similar to arrays in any other programming language.
But there are some important differences.
"""First, we do not need to declare an array before using it."""
"""Also, there is no need to specify how many elements the array will contain."""
"""In programming languages, array index is generally a positive integer."""
"""Usually the index starts from 0, then 1, then 2 and so on."""
"""But in awk, the index can be anything – any number or a string."""
This is the syntax of assigning an array element in awk. Array name can be any valid variable name.
Here the index can be an integer or a string.
"""Strings have to be written inside double quotes, whether it is index name or a value."""
Let’s understand this with an example.
I have already written the code and saved it as array_intro.awk.
This file is available in the Code Files link below the player. Please download and use it.
"""Here, I have taken weekdays as an example and written it inside the BEGIN section."""
"""Here, the name of the array is day."""
"""I have set the index as 1 and the value as """"Sunday""""."""
"""In this array element, I have used a string as the index. So, for index """"first"""", the value is """"Sunday""""."""
The entire array is constructed likewise.
"""Notice here, the array elements are not in a sequence. I have declared day four before day three."""
"""In awk arrays, index need not to be in a sequential manner."""
Advantage of associative array is that new pairs can be added at any time.
Let me add day 6 in the array.
Place the cursor at the end of the last line and press Enter. Then type the following.
Save the file.
We have declared the array. But how should we refer to the array element?
"""Write the arrayname and the index within square brackets to refer an element, at a particular index. Let us try this."""
Switch to the code once again.
Place the cursor in front of the closing curly brace.
Press Enter and type: print space day within square brackets 6.
Save the code.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using 'cd' command.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space array_intro.awk . Press Enter."""
"""See, we get Friday as the output."""
Next we will check whether any element exists in an array at a certain index.
"""For this, we have to use the in operator. Let me explain this with an example."""
Switch to the code in the editor window.
Place the cursor at the end of the print statement and press Enter. Then type as shown.
Now I have added two 'if' conditions.
The first if condition checks whether the index two is present in day.
"""If yes, then the corresponding print statement will get executed."""
Then the second condition checks whether the index seven is present in day. It will execute the print statement if it is true.
"""As we can see, index two is in the array and seven is not. Let’s execute this file to verify the output."""
Switch to the terminal. Press the up arrow key to get back the previously executed command.
Press Enter to execute.
We get the output as expected.
We will now make some more changes to the code. Update the code as shown here.
"""Below the 7  in  day condition, I have added one more condition."""
This will check whether the value of index seven is null or not.
"""If true, it will print Index 7 is not null."""
"""We already know that we don’t have any index with 7. So, it will not print anything."""
"""Next, we have changed the print statement of the condition 7 in day."""
Save the code. Let’s see what happens when we execute the code.
Switch to terminal. Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command.
Press Enter to execute.
We got an unexpected output.
"""The statement """"Index 7 is present after null comparison."""" is printed. How is it possible?"""
"""When we write, day[7]  not equal to  null, we are trying to access the element at index 7."""
This access itself will first create an element at index 7 and initialize it with the value null.
"""Next, we are trying to check if any element is actually present at index 7."""
"""As null element is already created, the output shows that Index 7 is present after null comparison."""
"""So, remember this: day at index 7 not equal to  null is a wrong way to check the presence of an element."""
It will create a null element at index 7.
"""Instead, we have to use the in operator."""
It will not create any extra element in the array. This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about- Arrays in awk,"""
"""Assigning array elements,"""
"""How it is different from arrays in other programming languages,"""
Refer the elements of an array .
As an assignment- Define an array flowerColor.
Index will be the names of the flowers.
Value will be the corresponding color of the flowers.
Insert entries for any five flowers of your choice.
Print the color of the fourth flower. Check if the flower “Lotus” is present in the array.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on awk built-in variables and awk script.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about Built-in variables ,  awk script."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and  gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and use them.
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the earlier awk tutorials on this website."""
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on this website."""
"""First, let us see some of the built-in variables in awk."""
"""Capital RS specifies the record separator in an input file. By default, it is newline."""
Capital FS specifies the field separator in an input file.
"""By default, the value of FS is a whitespace."""
"""Capital ORS defines the output record separator. By default, it is newline."""
"""Capital OFS defines the output field separator. By default, it is whitespace."""
Let us understand the meaning of each of these.
Let us have a look at the awkdemo file now.
"""When we are processing this awkdemo file with 'awk' command, this becomes our input file."""
Observe that all the records are separated from each other by a newline character.
"""newline is the default value for record separator RS variable.  So, there is no need to do anything else."""
Notice that all the fields are separated by the pipe symbol. How can we inform awk about it?  Let us see.
"""By default, any number of spaces or  tabs separate the fields."""
We can reset this with the help of hyphen capital F option as learnt in our earlier tutorials.
"""Or else, we can reset this in the BEGIN section with the use of FS variable."""
"""Let us do this through an example. Suppose, I want to find out the name of students who are getting a stipend of more than Rs.5000."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing CTRL, ALT and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using cd command.
Type the command as shown here.
"""Here, in the BEGIN section, we have assigned the value of FS as a pipe symbol. Similarly, we can modify RS variable."""
Press Enter to execute the command.
The output shows the list of students who are receiving more than Rs.5000 as a stipend.
"""Here, the name field and the stipend field are separated by a blank space."""
"""Also, all the records are separated by a newline character."""
Suppose we want colon as the output field separator and double newline as output record separator.
How can we do this? Let us see.
"""In the terminal, press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command."""
Modify the command as shown here and then press Enter.
We get the output in the desired format.
"""Now, suppose our new input file is sample.txt."""
Observe that the field separator here is newline and record separator is double newline.
How can we extract the roll no. and name information from this file?
"""Yes, you have guessed correctly. We have to modify both the FS and RS variables."""
Pause this tutorial and do this as an assignment.
"""Next, let us see other built-in variables."""
Capital NR gives  the Number of Records processed by awk.
Capital NF gives the Number of Fields in the current record.
"""Let us see one example on this. Suppose, we want to find incomplete lines in the file."""
"""Here, incomplete line means it has less than the normal 6 fields."""
Switch to the terminal. Let me clear the terminal using Ctrl and L keys.
Type the command as shown.
"""As the fields are separated by pipe symbol, set the FS value to pipe symbol in the BEGIN section."""
Next we have written NF not equal to 6.
This checks whether the number of fields in the current line is not equal to 6.
"""If true, then  print section will print the record’s line number NR, along with the entire line denoted by $0. Press Enter."""
"""In the output, we can see that record number 16 is the incomplete record. It has only 5 fields instead of 6."""
Let us see one more example. How can we print the first and last field for each student regardless of how many fields there are?
Type the command as shown here on the terminal.
Here we have used hyphen capital F option instead of setting FS variable. Press Enter.
We get only the first and the last fields for each record in the file.
Let’s try something else now.
"""Suppose, the student records are distributed across two files demo1.txt, demo2.txt."""
We want to print the first 3 lines from each of these two files. We can do this using NR variable.
Here are the contents of the two files.
"""Now, to display the first 3 lines from each file, type the following command on the terminal."""
The output shows only the first 3 records of demo1.txt file.
How can we print the same for the second file also?
The solution is to use FNR instead of NR. FNR is the current record number in the current file.
FNR is incremented each time a new record is read.
It is re-initialized to zero each time a new input file is started.
But NR is the number of input records awk has processed since the starting of the program's execution.
It does not reset to zero with a new file.
Switch to the terminal. Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command.
Modify the previous command as follows. Type FNR instead of NR.
"""In the Print section, next to NR, type FNR.  Press Enter."""
"""See, we get the correct output now. FNR is set to zero with new file but NR keeps on increasing."""
Let us now look at some other built-in variables. FILENAME variable gives the name of the file being read.
ARGC specifies the number of arguments provided at the command line.
ARGV represents an array that stores the command line arguments.
ENVIRON specifies the array of the shell environment variables and corresponding values.
"""As ARGV and ENVIRON use array in awk, we will look at those in subsequent tutorials."""
Let us have a look at the variable FILENAME now. How can we print the name of the current file being processed?
Switch to the terminal and type the command as shown.
Here we have used space as a string concatenation operator. Press Enter to execute the command.
The output shows the input filename multiple times.
"""This is because, this command prints the filename once for each row in the awkdemo.txt file. How can we print this only once?"""
Clear the terminal. Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command.
Modify the previous command as shown here. Press Enter.
"""Now, We get the filename only once."""
There are some other built-in variables in awk. Please browse the internet to know more on them.
"""Suppose, we want to  find the students who have passed and have stipend more than Rs.8000"""
use comma as the output field separator  and print “The data is shown for file” and the name of file in the footer section. How can we do this?
"""In the terminal, type the following command. Press Enter."""
"""We can see that only one student has passed and gets stipend more than Rs.8000. And, the record number is 2."""
"""We can also see the name of the file in the footer, as desired."""
We can use awk for more and more complex tasks.
"""In that case, it becomes more difficult to write the commands every time on the terminal."""
We can instead write the awk program in a separate file.
"""To be executable, that file should have the dot awk extension."""
"""While executing, we can just specify this awk program filename with the awk command."""
"""For doing so, we need to use hyphen small f option. Let us see an example."""
I have already written an awk program and saved it as prog1 dot awk.
This code is also available in the Code Files link.
"""Switch to the terminal. See, what have we written inside single quotes of the command last executed?"""
Content of prog1.awk file is exactly the same.
"""The only difference is that in the awk file, we have not written inside the single quotes."""
"""To execute the file, type the following on the terminal- awk space hyphen small f space prog1.awk space awkdemo.txt and press Enter."""
We are getting exactly the same output as we have seen before.
"""So, this way you can write awk programs and use it multiple times."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learnt about- Built-in variables, awk script  using various examples."""
As an assignment- write an awk script to print the last field of the 5th line in awkdemo.txt file.
Open the system file /etc/passwd on the terminal.
Identify all the separators therein.
Now write a script to process the file from the 20th line onwards.
"""That too, only for the lines that contain more than 6 fields."""
"""You should print the line number, entire line and count of fields in that particular line."""

Welcome to this tutorial on Tables and Figures.
We have two objectives in this tutorial.
The first one is to explain how to create tables using the tabular environment; the second objective is to explain how to include tables in latex documents using the table environment.
A similar technique can be used to include figures also.
"""We have seen how to create the title page,"""
"""this one has title, author information, and Creative Commons, copyright information as explained in the tutorial on equations."""
Today’s date appears in the last column created by this command.
Let us go to the second page.
"""I will now explain to you, how to create this table in a step-by-step fashion."""
Let us start with a clean slate.
Let me delete these commands.
I will compile this and start with a clean slate.
The tabular environment is created using begin tabular and end tabular commands.
Let me do that here.
"""The ‘r r’ characters within the braces, next to the begin tabular, say that there are two columns and that they are right aligned."""
"""In the first line, the entries are """"mango"""" and """"mixed""""."""
Two reverse-slashes indicate next line.
Let me enter the next line.
"""""""Jackfruit""""."""
"""""""Kolli hills""""."""
"""""""Banana""""."""
"""""""Green""""."""
Let me end this tabular environment.
Let me compile this.
"""And, this has appeared here."""
We get the 3 by 2 table. There are three rows and 2 columns.
The two columns are right aligned as indicated by the 'r r' character.
"""To separate the two columns, we introduce a vertical line between the column alignment characters."""
"""So, let me put that vertical line."""
"""Save it,Compile it."""
You see that a vertical line has come.
"""If you want vertical lines at the end also, put them at appropriate places."""
"""Let me put them, save them, compile them."""
"""So, these have come."""
"""As a matter of fact, we can put more vertical lines."""
Let me put one more vertical line at the beginning.
There you are! A second line has come.
See there are two vertical lines.
We will now try different alignments.
Let's put a ‘c’ here to say that the second column should be center aligned.
This is center aligned now.
Let us make the first column left aligned.
"""Right now, it is right aligned; let me make them left aligned."""
"""'l',Save"""
Compile.
Now it is left aligned.
We will now separate the rows with horizontal lines as follows.
Let's put a h-line here.
Let us see what happens when we do that.
It puts a top line.
"""If I put another h-line here,"""
"""see a line has come,So, let me complete this."""
Let me put h-line.
Here I have to put a break line with two reverse slashes and then h-line.
H-line begins from the beginning of the sentence.
"""So, now I have completed the horizontal lines."""
"""Now, let us add three more columns and one more row."""
"""So, what I do is- I come here, and 'c' , 'c', 'r'."""
"""So, I have added three more columns, first two of them are center aligned the third one is right aligned."""
And then here I want to say:
"""""""fruit"""""""
"""""""type"""""""
"""""""number of units"""""""
"""""""cost per unit"""""""
"""""""cost rupees"""""""
h-line.
"""So, """"mixed"""""""
"""""""20"""""""
"""""""75"""" rupees"""
"""""""1500"""" rupees."""
"""""""Jackfruit"""""""
"""""""10"""" of them"""
"""""""50"""" rupees"""
"""""""500"""" rupees."""
"""""""Banana green"""""""
"""""""10"""" dozens"""
"""""""20"""" rupees a dozen and """"200"""" rupees total."""
"""So, let’s see whether we can compile this."""
"""So, it has created the table."""
"""See the need for right alignment, this is.. so that we can add these numbers."""
"""Suppose, that we want to split the columns in two."""
"""For example, here these two columns have fruit details and these three have cost calculations."""
"""So, this is done with the help of what is known as multi-column command."""
Let me do it as follows.
multi-column
take 2
center-aligned
Fruit Details.
First two are over then I put a tab to indicate the next column.
Go to the next line.
"""multi-column, three, also to be center-aligned."""
Cost within braces – cost calculations
slash h-line.
"""So, there you are."""
"""The first two have the title """"Fruit details"""", the next three have the title """"Cost calculations""""."""
I don’t have the vertical lines that’s because I didn’t tell latex to do that. So let’s do that.
"""Here, I want two vertical lines, here I want one vertical line."""
"""Before this, I already have the line here, so let me just put this here."""
See what happens.
"""So, now the vertical lines have also come."""
Because these 2 and 3 are single character arguments its possible to write them without braces.
"""Okay, same thing works."""
Sometimes it is necessary to draw horizontal lines between only a few columns.
"""So, we explain this as follows."""
"""Let me split this """"mango"""" instead of """"mixed"""", let me call this """"Malgoa"""""""
"""and then """"18"""" kilograms"""
"""""""50"""" kilograms."""
Let me delete this.
"""okay,And here, let me say that it is """"Alfanso"""""""
"""""""2"""" dozens"""
"""""""300"""" rupees a dozen, and a total of 1500."""
Let’s see what happens when I save this. Compile this.
"""So, I’ve got this. What happens is, this line comes here and as well as here and I don’t want this and this. So, this is taken care of by saying instead of this horizontal line, I want a 'c' line and between"
"""So, I should have done this here."""
So let me put this back here.
H-line here.
c-line 2 to 4.
"""Okay, so now I have the line between columns two and four only."""
"""So, this central line has split the mangoes into two of the most popular mangoes in India."""
"""We will conclude this example, conclude this table with a last row."""
Let me total up as follows.
multi-column four
"""2 vertical lines, right-aligned"""
vertical separator
Total cost
Rupees.
Close this.
Next tab
2200
So there you are.
"""So, this was the table that we started with at the beginning of this tutorial."""
How do we work with the tables created using the tabular environment?
Latex treats the entire table created using the tabular environment as a single object.
"""For example- if you write,"""
This is
an
example
"""""""This is an example table""""."""
"""What happens is this table gets sandwiched between these two. """"This is an"""" example to, """"example table""""."""
This table appears in a running sentence.
It is possible to include tables using a centre environment.
A more common approach is to include it in the table environment. As we show now.
begin
table
Close this.
"""So, what happens is now ‘this is an example table’."""
This statement comes separately and whatever that appeared between this ‘begin’ and ‘end’ table have been placed separately as a table.
"""In other words, even though the table appears in between some text, it has been put separately."""
This is not centered.
"""What I can do is, give a command here called ‘centering’"""
to place this at the center of the document.
Let us now create a caption.
Table caption is put before the table.
Let me put a caption here.
"""""""Caption cost of fruits in India""""."""
"""So, the caption has come."""
This is too close; I want to leave a small space.
Let me do that by giving through this v-space command 1 ex.
That is the space equivalent of the ‘x’ character.
"""So, I have left this vertical space."""
"""So, now it looks okay."""
"""By default, Latex places tables at the top of the page."""
This placement is done automatically.
The table is ‘floated’ to the next available slot.
"""To explain this, let me cut and paste some text from the bottom of this document."""
Alright.
"""Now, there is some write up about these fruits."""
Go to the top of this.
Paste it here.
"""So, as before, the table got placed at the top of this page."""
Let me put some more text here.
Four copies.
"""So, now what has happened is-"""
this table has been floated to the second page and
"""there is nothing else here. So, it has been placed at the middle of this page."""
"""Let me put one more copy of this, some more text."""
"""this is the title page, this is the text page, the table has been floated, it has gone to the top of this page."""
"""As in equations, we can also create labels and use them for referencing."""
"""For example,"""
you give this command below the caption command.
You have to give it below the caption command because it is the caption command that creates the table number.
"""For example, here 'table 1' has been created automatically by this caption command."""
"""If you put the label after this, this label will refer to the number created using the caption command."""
So label
fruits.
"""So, let me just go back and say"""
let me add this line here.
"""The cost of these fruits is shown in Table reference, you have to give the label, it should be the same as this."""
tab fruits
Let me compile it.
"""So there it is,On first compilation, this variable is not assigned."""
"""So let me re-compile it, so now I have got this."""
We can create a list of tables automatically
as we explain now.
"""After the make title, suppose we want this list of tables - one word, is the command."""
So what has happened is
it has created a list of tables.
Typically one would have to compile twice to make sure the table number comes correct.
"""Here it comes, the table according to this list is in page two but we know that it is in page 3."""
"""So, this is in page 3."""
"""So, let's go back and compile it once more."""
"""So there you are, it is in page 3."""
So this has been explained before.
"""Alright, this comes to the end of this part in which we explained the tables."""
We will now explain how to create figures using the command called include graphics.
"""So for this, we need to include this package called graphicx."""
"""Okay! Suppose I go to the bottom of this,"""
"""and say, the command is as follows. begin figure"""
include graphics
width equals.
I have a file called iitb.pdf.
There you are.
I include it here with the width of this figure coming out to be equal to that of the line width.
Let me end this figure.
Compile this.
There you are.
"""So, it has also been put at the top of this page."""
"""Alright! What I will do is, let me just, so this is for if I want to use the entire line width ."""
"""Suppose I want to use point 5, that is half a line width,"""
then it has been made small.
And note that it has been left aligned.
"""As in the table, I can say centering"""
which will center this at the middle.
I can also create a caption; figure captions are created after the figure is included.
Golden Jubilee logo of IIT Bombay.
"""Okay, as before I can create a label and refer to it using the ref command."""
I can also make this list of figures appear along with the list of tables.
"""So, suppose I want list of figures also."""
I will compile it.
I will compile it twice.
and there it is. List of figures also comes automatically.
All the figure captions will appear here.
There is one last thing that I want to show you here.
That is how to rotate these figures.
This is done by the angle option.
"""Suppose, angle... I want to rotate by 90 degrees."""
"""So, let's go to this figure."""
Let’s compile this.
"""So, this has been rotated by 90 degrees."""
Rotate it by 'minus 90'.
"""Alright. So, this is the way to include the figures."""
"""Here, I am assuming that iitb.pdf is available."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
The beginners of latex should compile after every few changes to the source document and make sure that what they have entered is correct.
Thank you for listening to this tutorial.
Welcome to Meet the GIMP tutorial on Setting up the Gimp.
"""Today I want to show, how to set up the GIMP when you are using it for the first time."""
"""The GIMP uses a lot of small windows instead of one big window, like all the other Windows & Macintosh programs."""
It’s a history from the Unix world and the Unix people love to have windows scattered all over the screen and to have lot of programs running at the same time.
"""If you are really not able to work with these different windows, then you should look at the GIMPshop."""
It is a program which uses the GIMP and puts a new user interface on it to make it a bit similar to Photoshop.
I would like to use the GIMP because all the new and better tools are in the GIMP.
This is the tip of the day which gives useful information and tips.
"""Right now, there is a tip about the Undo option by which you can do some steps and then change them back with Undo."""
It works most of the time.
It's better to save your work before you do something very different.
"""Now, let's have a look at the other tools."""
"""Here’s the main window from the GIMP, the Command Central."""
"""And at the top here, is the Toolbox."""
Then we have the Color box to select colours from and below are the various options of our tools from Toolbox.
Let’s make this a bit wider.
"""Here we have dialog boxes for Layers, Channels, Color Channels, Path and Undo History."""
"""Below, this is the Colour Selection dialog where you can select various colours."""
"""There are more dialogs like Brushes, Patterns, Gradient and so on."""
I want to include some of these dialogs into the Toolbox. It is very easy to do so.
"""Just click on the word Layers in the title of the dialog and pull it over to the word Color Picker here, below the toolbox."""
And I get a tabbed dialog like this.
I'll do this with Channels.
I'll do this with Paths.
And I'll do this with Undo History.
I don’t think I need the Brushes tool because if a tool has a brush then it appears here and I can select it.
"""But I want to have Colours, so I click on it and drag it next to Undo History."""
And this window here can be closed.
I can access all the dialog boxes through File >> Dialogs.
"""You can see here, there are some dialogs that are not in our Toolbox and we need one of them i.e. Tools."""
My tool box contains some tools which I have never used and I want to replace them with the tools that I want to use.
Let’s start with the tools which I want to have.
"""I want to have Curves, Levels, Threshold. Brightness & Contrast - I don't want to choose."""
I don’t need Perspective Clone nor do I need Ink or Airbrush.
And I need all the remaining tools.
I will have a look at this later after I see how much space is left.
Now I go to File and Preferences.
I leave Environment as it is and Interface also.
"""In Theme, I select Small."""
"""And when I pull this window aside, you see all the icons have shrunk and there’s more space available for information of tools."""
"""Go to Tool Options and change Default interpolation to Sinc , it’s the best interpolation for calculating pixels while resizing or rotating and so on."""
Leave all the other options as they are.
Go to Toolbox and either select if you want to have these options or de-select them.
You can have Colors which is a quick way to change the Foreground and background colours.
"""You can get the Brush and the Gradient tools, here you can have a small image or the thumbnail of the active image."""
"""I don’t need it, so I de-select it. Its up to you if you want to have it or not."""
"""You can leave the Default Image, Default Grid and Default Image Window as they are."""
I am done with all the Preferences.
And
"""I haven’t changed the Path, so I can use this here."""
"""Now, I have to get rid of only one tool here to get some more space. But first I’ll make this a bit wider."""
You can see that the Toolbox dialog is quite cramped.
Just pull it over here.
I think I can add 3 more tools without getting into a new row here.
"""So I will add Brightness, Hue-Saturation and Color Balance."""
All the tools which are not displayed here can be reached by clicking on File and Dialogs.
And now we are set to do our work.
"""When you close the GIMP, all the options are automatically saved and it will start up in the same way in which you had closed it."""
"""And by the way, I am using the development version, the unstable version of GIMP 2.3.18"""
I just saw that 2.3.19 was released today.
It is called 'unstable' but the GIMP is reaching a point where 2.4 is the next stable version on the horizon and this year it is stable as any other software in the market.
That was it for setting up the GIMP.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on  Introduction to KTouch.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn about KTouch and the KTouch interface."""
"""You will learn how to type: accurately, quickly, and efficiently on a computer keyboard that has the English alphabet keys."""
You will also learn to
type without having to look down at the keyboard every time you type.
What is KTouch?
KTouch is a typing tutor. It teaches you how to type using an online interactive keyboard.
You can learn typing at your own pace.
You can gradually increase your typing speed and along with it your accuracy.
"""KTouch also has lectures or typing samples, in various levels of difficulty, for you to practice with."""
"""Here, we are using KTouch 1.7.1 on Ubuntu Linux 11.10."""
You can install KTouch using the Ubuntu Software Centre.
"""For more information on 'Ubuntu Software Centre', please refer to the Ubuntu Linux Tutorials on this website."""
Let’s open KTouch.
"""First, click Dash Home which is the round button on the top left corner of your computer desktop."""
The Search box appears.
"""In the Search box, type: """"KTouch""""."""
The KTouch icon appears beneath the Search box. Click on it.
The KTouch window appears.
"""Alternately, you can open KTouch using the Terminal."""
"""To open a Terminal, press the Ctrl and Alt and T keys together."""
"""To open KTouch in the Terminal, type the command: ktouch and press Enter."""
"""Now, let’s familiarize ourselves with the KTouch interface."""
"""The main menu comprises the File, Training, Settings and Help menus."""
Click Start New Session to start a new session to practice typing.
Click Pause Session to pause while typing.
Click on Lecture Statistics to know your typing progress.
"""Level indicates the level of complexity, in terms of the number of keys used when typing."""
Speed indicates the number of characters that you can type per minute.
The Correctness indicator displays the percentage correctness of typing.
The New Characters in This Level field displays the characters that you need to practice at the selected level.
The Teacher’s Line displays the characters that have to be typed.
The Student’s Line displays the characters that are typed by you using the keyboard.
The Keyboard is displayed in the centre.
"""The first line of the keyboard displays numerals, special characters and the Backspace key."""
Press the Backspace key to delete typed characters.
"""The second line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, few special characters and the Tab key."""
"""The third line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, colon, semicolon, and Caps lock keys."""
Press the Enter key to go to the next line while typing.
Press the Caps Lock key to type  capital letters.
"""The fourth line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, special characters, and Shift keys."""
Press the Shift key together with any other alphabet key to type capital letters.
Press the Shift key with any other key to type a character given at the top of the key.
"""For example, the key with the numeral 1 has the exclamation mark on top. To type the exclamation mark, press the Shift key together with 1."""
"""The fifth line of the keyboard comprises the Ctrl, Alt and Function keys. It also contains the space bar."""
"""Now let us see if there are differences between the KTouch keyboard, laptop keyboard and desktop keyboard."""
Notice that the KTouch keyboard and the keyboards used in desktops and laptops are similar.
"""Now, let’s see the correct placement of our fingers on the keyboard."""
Look at this slide.It displays the fingers and their names.
"""Fingers, from left to right, are named: Little finger,"""
"""Ring finger, Middle finger,"""
Index finger and Thumb.
"""On your keyboard, place your left hand on the left side of the keyboard."""
Ensure that the little finger is on alphabet ‘A’.
"""Ring finger is on the alphabet ‘S’,"""
"""Middle finger on alphabet ‘D’,"""
Index finger on alphabet ‘F’.
"""Now, place your right hand on the right side of the keyboard."""
Ensure that the little finger is on the colon/semi-colon key.
"""Ring finger on the alphabet ‘L’,"""
"""Middle finger on the alphabet ‘K’,"""
Index finger on the alphabet ‘J’.
Use your right thumb to press the space bar.
"""The first time you open KTouch, the Teacher’s Line displays default text."""
This text lists instructions on how to select the lecture and begin the typing lessons.
"""For the purposes of this tutorial, we shall skip typing the default text and select a lecture."""
"""However, you can pause this tutorial and type the default text."""
"""Now, let us select the lecture to begin the typing lessons."""
"""From the main menu, select File, click Open Lecture."""
The Select Training Lecture File – ‘KTouch’ dialog box appears.

"""By default, the Level is set to 1 and the Speed is set to zero."""
The New Characters in This Level displays the characters we will learn in this level.
Notice that the cursor is in the Student’s Line.
Let us type the character displayed in the teacher's line using the keyboard.
"""As we type, the characters are displayed in the 'Student’s Line'."""
Look at the Speed field now.
"""As you type, the number increases or decreases based on the speed of your typing."""
"""If you stop typing, the speed count decreases."""
"""Now, let’s type the numbers seven & eight which are not displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'."""
The 'Student Line' has become red.
Why? That’s because we have mistyped or made an error in typing.
Let’s delete it and complete the typing.
"""When you reach the end of the line, press the Enter key to move to the second line."""
"""Notice, that the 'Teacher’s Line' now displays the next set of characters to type."""
The 'Student’s line' is cleared of the typed text.
Let’s check how accurately we have typed.
"""The Correctness field displays the percentage of correctness of your typing. For example, it may display 80 percent."""
We have completed our first typing lesson!
It is a good practice to first learn to type accurately at lower speeds.
"""Once we learn to type accurately, without mistakes, we can increase the typing speed."""
Let’s begin a new typing session.
Click Start New Session.
"""In the Start new training session – ‘KTouch’ dialog box, click Start from First Level."""
What do you see?
A set of characters are displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
The 'Student’s Line' is cleared of all characters and is blank.
Let’s start typing.
"""While practicing, you may want to pause and restart later."""
How do you pause your session?
Click Pause Session.
Notice that the speed does not decrease.
Recall that it decreased when we stopped typing without pausing the earlier session.
"""To resume typing, type the next character   displayed in the 'Teacher’s line'."""
"""Once we complete typing, we can check the Correctness field. It displays the accuracy of typing."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on KTouch.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about the KTouch interface. We also learnt how to: place our fingers on the key board,"""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Subclassing and Method overriding.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:  subclassing , extends keyword and  method overriding."""
"""Here we are using:  Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 , JDK 1.7 , Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit our website."""
"""First of all, we will learn what subclassing is."""
It is a way to create a new class from an existing class.
The new class created is  subclass or derived class or child class.
The already existing class is called superclass or base class or parent class.
"""Now, let me show you how to create a subclass. I have already created a project named MyProject."""
I have created a class  in it named Employee.
"""It has variables, name and email_address."""
It also has the setter and getter methods for the class.
"""It has a method """"getDetails()"""". This method returns  """"name"""" and """"email_address""""."""
"""Now, let us come to the Manager class."""
"""It has variables- name, email_address and department."""
We can see that some variables are common to both Employee and Manager class.
name and email_address are present in the Employee class. We can see that it is also there in Manager class.
"""Thus, Manager class can be made a subclass of Employee class."""
"""For that, we have to make some changes in the Manager class."""
"""After public class Manager, type: extends Employee."""
We use the extends keyword to create a subclass from an existing class.
Remove the duplicate variables common to both the classes.
"""So, remove name and email_address from Manager class."""
Also remove setter and getter methods of the same.
"""In the class 'Manager', we will have only one variable department."""
We also have the setter and getter method for department.
"""In this way, the 'Manager' class inherits the members of 'Employee' class."""
This way of extending one class from another is called single inheritance.
I have also created another class named 'TestEmployee'.
"""Inside the main method, we will create the object of  Manager class."""
"""So, inside the main method, type: Manager manager equal to new Manager parentheses."""
"""Next, we will call the setter methods of the Manager class."""
"""So, type, manager dot setName within brackets and double quotes Nikkita Dinesh"""
Then type: manager dot setEmail within brackets and double quotes abc at gmail dot com.
"""Then type, manager dot setDepartment within brackets and double quotes Accounts."""
"""You can use any name, email address and department."""
"""Now, let us call the getDetails() method using the Manager object."""
"""So, type: System.out.println within brackets manager dot getDetails."""
"""Now, let us save and run the program."""
"""We can see that we get the output as: Name: Nikkita Dinesh ,Email: abc@gmail.com"""
"""Here, the object of the 'Manager' class calls the getDetails() method."""
"""Now, come to the Manager class."""
We can see that there is no getDetails() method here.
"""But, we still got the output. This is because, the Manager class extends the Employee class."""
The Manager class automatically inherits the variables and methods of  Employee class.
"""So, it checks in the parent class which is Employee."""
Let us come to the Employee class. It finds the getDetails() method here.
"""Note that we have not returned the department. As a result, it did not print the department in the output."""
"""Now, let us change the getDetails method  to private. Save the file."""
We can see that we get a compilation error in the TestEmployee class.
"""It says """"The method getDetails() from the type Employee is not visible""""."""
This means that getDetails() method cannot be accessed.
This is because we have declared getDetails() method as 'private'.
A subclass does not inherit the private members of its superclass.
Subclass cannot directly access the private members of the superclass.
The superclass can have public or protected methods.
These methods can access their private fields.
The subclass can also access the private fields through these methods.
"""So, let us change it back to public."""
"""Now, let us include the method getDetails in the Manager class."""
"""This method will return name, email_address and department."""
"""So, type: public String getDetails parentheses."""
"""Inside the method, type: return within brackets Name plus getName() plus slash n plus Email plus getEmail() plus slash n plus Manager of plus getDepartment() semicolon.  Save the file."""
"""Note that now, we have the method getDetails in both 'Manager' and 'Employee' class."""
"""The name, return type and argument list of the method is same in both the classes."""
"""A method in the subclass is said to override the method in the parent class if: name ,return type ,argument list ,match exactly."""
Come back to the Manager class.
"""Before the getDetails() method, type: @Override."""
This is an override annotation. It indicates that a method is intended to override a method in superclass.
"""Now, let us see what annotation is."""
"""Annotations:  start with at (@) sign character , provide data about a program , have no direct effect on the operation of the code."""
"""If a method is annotated with @Override, compiler generates error if:  the method does override a method declared in a superclass."""
The method signature is different in its superclass.
"""Now, let us come back to the IDE. Come back to the Manager class."""
The at (@) sign character indicates the compiler that what follows is an annotation.
"""Here, it shows that the getDetails() method is overridden."""
Let us come to the TestEmployee class.
Save the file and run the program.
"""We get the output as follows: Name: Nikkita Dinesh ,Email: abc@gmail.com ,Manager of Accounts ."""
"""Here, the object of the Manager class calls the getDetails() method."""
"""But this time, it calls the method of Manager class itself."""
"""In this way, we override the method of the parent class by the subclass."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about:Subclassing and Method Overriding."""
"""As an assignment, create a class Vehicle which has a method run that prints “The Vehicle is running.”"""
Also create a class Bike which has a method run that prints “The Bike is running safely.”
The output should be “The Bike is running safely.”

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on the Mozilla Firefox - Search and Auto-complete features.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Search, manage Search Engines, use the Find bar,"""
use Auto-complete in the Address bar.
"""In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04."""
One of the most common things people do on the internet is to search for information.
One can search for a specific website or for some other information.
Mozilla Firefox has a number of functionalities that make it easy to search for information on the Internet.
Let’s look at some of the ways.
One way is to search by visiting other websites.
"""After all, search engines are websites too!"""
"""In the URL bar, type: ‘www.google.com’."""
The google home page comes up.
"""In the search box  of the google home page, type: ‘email’ and click Search."""
The search engine brings up all the results.
"""We see that the top result is for g mail, the email from 'google'."""
"""But, there is an easier way to do the same thing with Mozilla Firefox."""
"""Next to the 'URL bar' on the navigation toolbar, there is a Search bar field."""
"""Alternately, you can press Ctrl+K to directly go to the Search bar  field."""
Click on the search bar and type ‘email’.
Click the magnifying glass icon that is next to it.
We will see the results of the search in the contents area.
"""We see that the top result is for 'gmail', the email from 'google'."""
"""On the left side of the 'Search bar', the logo of the search engine which has been used to bring up the results is seen."""
The default search engine used in Mozilla Firefox is ‘google’.
"""But, we need not be constrained by this. We can choose the search engine of our choice."""
Click on the google’s search engine logo within the Search bar.
We notice that a drop-down box appears with the logos of most popular search engines including “Yahoo” and “Bing”.
Select “Yahoo” from the drop-down box.
We observe that the logo on the left of the search bar has now changed to the “Yahoo” logo.
"""Now, let's  type ‘email’ again in the 'Search bar' and click the magnifying glass."""
This time we see that the results in the Contents area are from the “Yahoo” search engine.
Observe that the results are slightly different from last time.
"""The top result is no longer 'gmail'. Instead, the top result is “Yahoo” mail."""
Click on the search engine logo within the 'Search bar' again.
"""In the drop-down box,  select Manage Search Engines."""
This opens a dialog box entitled ‘Manage Search Engine List'.
Click on the last item in the list.
The buttons on the right side are now enabled. Click on the Remove button.
We see that the item we chose is no longer on the list.
Click on OK to close the dialog box.
Click on the search engine logo within the 'Search bar' again.
Click on “Manage Search Engines”.
"""The “Manage Search Engines List"""" dialog box pops up."""
At the bottom of the dialog is a link that says ‘Get more search engines…’.
Click on it.A new browser tab opens.
It displays a number of search engines that we can add to the search bar.
You can add any of the 'search engines' according to your requirement.
Let's close this tab by clicking on the 'x' at the corner of the tab.
We can find specific text which is within the Contents area with the help of the Find bar.
"""In the URL bar, type: ‘www.gmail.com’ and press Enter."""
"""When the 'gmail home page' has loaded, click on Edit and then on Find."""
A Find bar appears at the bottom of the browser window.
"""In the text box of the “Find bar”, type: ‘gmail’."""
"""As we type, we see that the first instance of that text is being highlighted in the Contents area."""
Clicking on Next will move the focus to the next instance of the word.
Clicking on Previous will move the focus to the previous instance of the word.
Click on Highlight all option.
We see that all instances of the search text are highlighted in the Contents area.
Mozilla Firefox makes it easy to type web addresses in the 'URL bar' with its auto-complete function.
We don’t have to type the entire web address in the address bar.
"""Try this: In the 'address bar', type: ‘gma’."""
We see that Mozilla Firefox tries to auto-complete the word we are typing.
It brings up a drop-down list with websites that start with ‘gma’.
Choose the ‘gmail’ link from the drop-down list.
The ‘gmail’ webpage loads in the 'Contents area'.
"""If we do not like this feature, we can turn it off."""
Click on Edit and then on Preferences.
Windows users can click on Tools and then on Options.
Choose the Privacy tab from the list of main-menu tabs.
"""At the very bottom of the dialog box, is an option named ‘When using the location bar, suggest’."""
Click on the arrow of  the drop-down list to expand it.
Select 'Nothing' from the list.
Click on ‘Close’ to close the dialog box.
Let's go back to the 'address bar' and type ‘gma’. Notice that no suggestions come up.
This concludes this tutorial of Mozilla Firefox - Searching and Auto-complete features.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt how to: use Search, manage Search Engine, use the Find bar, use Auto-compete in Address bar."""
Try this comprehension test assignment.
Change the search engine in the search bar to “Yahoo”.
Search for ‘spoken tutorial’.
Click on the first result.
Find how many times the word “video” appears in the page.
"""Now, click on ‘Highlight all’ to highlight all the instances of the word “video” in the webpage."""

"""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."""
Let us start with the introduction to the scope of variables.
It is the region of code within which the variable can be accessed.
Depending on it's type and place of declaration it is divided into two categories:
Global Variable &
Local Variable.
Now we will see an example.
I have already typed the program on the editor.
Let me open it.
Note that our file name is scope.c.
Here we have declared two global variables a and b.
And we have initialized them by assigning values as 5 and 2.
A global variable is available to all functions in your program.
"""These are declared outside any functions, above main() function."""
These have a global scope.
Here we have declared a function add without arguments.
"""Here 'sum' is  a local variable, it is declared inside the function add."""
A local variable is available only to the function inside which it is declared.
These variables are declared inside a block.
These have local scope.
Then sum of a & b will be stored in the variable 'sum'. Here we print the sum.
The add function is called and then executed.
And this is our return statement.
Let us execute the program.
"""Please open the terminal window  by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space scope.c space hyphen o space sco and press Enter."""
"""To execute, type ./sco (dot slash sco), press Enter."""
The output is displayed as
Sum of a and b is 7.
Now let us see how to execute the same program in C++.
"""Come back to our program. First press Shift, Ctrl & S keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with an extension .cpp  (dot cpp) and click on Save.
Let us change the header file as iostream.
Now  include the using statement. Click on save .
The  declaration of global variable and local variable is same in  C++.
"""So, no need to change anything."""
Now replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
Delete the format specifier and ''.
Now delete the comma.
Type two opening angle brackets.
"""Delete the closing bracket, again type two opening angle brackets."""
And within the double quotes type backslash n. Now click on Save.
"""To compile, type g++ space scope dot cpp space -o space sco1"""
Here we have sco1 because we don't want to overwrite output parameter sco for the file 'scope.c'.
To execute type ./sco1 and press Enter.
The output is displayed as  Sum of a and b is 7.
We can see  that it is similar to our C code.
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across.
Come back to our program. Suppose here I will declare a  variable a again.
Type int a  and a semicolon.
Click on Save. We have declared  the variable 'a' above the main() function and after the add function.
Let us see what happens.
Come back to our  terminal.
Now compile as before.
"""We see errors, redefinition of 'int a'  ,  'int a' previously defined here. Come back to our program."""
a is a global variable.
It has a global scope.
We cannot declare the variable twice as it is already declared globally.
We can only declare variable a as a local variable .
Let us fix the error.
Delete this .
Let us execute again Come back to our terminal.
"""Now compile as before, execute as before."""
"""In this tutorial we learnt ,"""
"""Scope of variable,"""
"""Global variable, e.g : int a=5 &"""
"""and  local variable ,e.g:int sum"""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Static blocks .
In this tutorial we will learn:  What are static blocks
How to declare static blocks and  How to use static blocks.
Here we are using :Ubuntu 14.04 JDK 1 .7 and  Eclipse 4.3.1
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
"""You should also have the knowledge of instance variables, static variables and static methods in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
Let us learn about static blocks.
A  Static block is mostly used for initializing values of static variables.
A static block is declared using the static keyword.
Static blocks are executed when the class is loaded in memory.
"""If there are static blocks in a program, they are invoked before constructors."""
We cannot access instance variables inside a static block.
"""Now, we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called StaticBlockDemo."""
"""Inside this project, we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Static Blocks."""
Right click on src folder and click New-> Class.
Type the name of the class as StudentEnroll and press Enter.
Now type the following code to represent the StudentEnroll class.
Note that there are two static variables count and orgname.
Now click on Source -> and select Generate Constructor using Fields.
Delete the super keyword from the generated code.
We want a message to be printed whenever the constructor is invoked.
"""So inside this constructor, type the following code to print “Constructor invoked”."""
Now we will add a method showData( ) to this class to print the values of the variables.
So type the following code.
Now we will add a static block to initialize the values of count and orgname.
The variables orgname and count are static variables.
This block of code within the curly brackets prefixed by the static keyword is a static block.
This static block initializes the values for count and orgname as 100 and IITM respectively.
"""Inside this static block, type the following code to print “static block-1 is invoked”."""
Now we will add one more class containing the main method.
"""So right click on the default package, click New-> Class and then type the name as Demo."""
Inside this class we will have the main method.
Type main and then press Ctrl+space to generate the main method.
We will create an object of StudentEnroll class.
Type the following code to create an object s1.
Now let us invoke the showData method to print the values.
Type s1.showData() semicolon
Now let us run the Demo program.
We can observe that static block is invoked before the constructor.
The values of count and orgname are initialized as defined in the static block.
Now let us go back to the StudentEnroll class.
Let us see what happens if we initialise the value of id inside the static block.
"""Inside the static block type,  id equals IT01 semicolon"""
We can see that an error comes up.
It indicates that an instance variable cannot be accessed inside a static block
Now let us comment this line and proceed further.
Let us go back to the slides
A class can contain multiple static blocks.
In such a case they are called only once in the order that they appear in the source code.
Switch back to Eclipse to verify it.
Let us include one more static block after the existing one.
This static block initializes the values for count and orgname as 200 and IITB respectively.
Inside this static block type the following code.
Now let us run the Demo program again.
"""From the output, We can verify that the second static block is invoked after the first."""
The values of the static variables count and orgname are updated by the second static block.
They are 200 and IITB respectively.
In this tutorial we have learnt : What is a static block How to declare and define a static block and  How static blocks are invoked and executed.
"""For the Assignment, This assignment is a continuation of the Static Methods assignment."""
Make sure that you have completed the Static Methods assignment.
As before design the class CarService as specified in this slide.
Identify the instance variables and static variables.
Define a constructor to initialize the values for instance variables.
Define a static block to initialize the values of static variables.
Also create a Demo class containing the main method.
"""Inside the main method, create a few objects of CarService and invoke the show( ) method."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Creating objects.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Reference Variables Constructing objects and Memory Allocation for objects."""
"""Here, we are using : Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse IDE 3.7.0"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know how to create a simple class using Eclipse."""
"""If not, please see the Spoken Tutorial on these topics available at Spoken hyphen Tutorial dot org."""
We know that variables and methods together form the members of a class.
"""To access the members of a class, we need to create an object for the class."""
"""Now, let us see what an object is."""
An object is an instance of a class.
Each object consist of state and behavior.
"""Recall the example of 'human being' class, we had discussed in the earlier tutorial."""
Object stores its state in fields or variables.
It exposes its behavior through methods.
Now let us learn about reference variables.
We know about the 8 primitive data types in Java.
All other types refer to objects rather than primitives.
Variables that refer to objects are reference variables.
Let us go back to the Student class which we have already created in the earlier tutorial.
"""Now, let me remove the main method from this class."""
"""Now, Save the file by pressing Control and S keys simultaneously."""
"""Now, create another class named TestStudent inside the same project."""
I have already created it.
"""In this class, I have the main method."""
"""Now, inside the main method I will create an object of the Student class."""
"""For that, inside the main method, type:"""
Student space stud1 equal to new space Student opening and closing brackets semicolon.
"""Thus, we have created an object of the Student class."""
"""Here, Student is the name of the class for which the object is to be created."""
stud1 is a reference variable referring to one object of the Student class.
And the new keyword allocates space for the new object to be created.
Please note that stud1 is not the object of the Student class.
It only holds the reference of the new object created.
"""Now, let us see what stud1 contains."""
"""So, next line, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes stud1 contains space plus stud1 and then semicolon."""
"""Now, save and run the file TestStudent dot java."""
We get the output as follows.
"""So, here Student is the name of the class of the new object created."""
The second part is the memory address of the new object created.
We can access the fields and methods of the Student class using stud1.
We will learn about these in the coming tutorials.
"""Now, I will create one more object of the Student class."""
"""So, I will type: Student space stud2 equal to new space Student opening and closing brackets semicolon."""
"""Now, type: next line System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes stud2 contains space plus stud2 and then semicolon."""
"""Now, let us save and run this file."""
"""We can see that, here, stud1 and stud2 refer to two different objects."""
"""That is, stud1 and stud2 are referring to two different students."""
They have different roll numbers and names.
"""Now, we can make a change here."""
"""Here, type: Student stud2 equal to stud1."""
"""Now, save and run this file."""
"""We can see that, here, both stud1 and stud2 refer to the same object."""
"""That means, both stud1 and stud2 are referring to the same student with a roll number and name."""
"""So, in this tutorial, we learnt about:"""
"""Reference variables,  Creating object using new operator"""
And  assigning references.
"""For self assessment,"""
Create another class named TestEmployee.
Create an object of the Employee class  with reference variable as emp1.
"""To know more about the spoken tutorial project,"""

More information on this mission is available at  [2].
"""Thus, we  have come to the end of this tutorial."""
Thanks for joining us.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on More on sed.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn some more on 'sed' commands through some examples."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:"""
Linux  Operating System and
GNU BASH version 4.2.24
"""Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
"""As prerequisites,"""
you should know basics of Linux terminal.
You should be aware of sed tool.
"""For relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown: http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
The major use of sed is substitution.
Replacing some pattern in the input with something else.
Let's first look at the original file seddemo.txt.
Notice that the word Kumar occurs two times in the fourth line and once in the sixth line.
"""If you want to replace all occurrences of ‘Kumar’ with ‘Roy’,"""
type on the terminal:
sed space within single quote 's front slash / opening square bracket small k capital K   closing square bracket umar  slash Roy slash' after the single quotes space seddemo.txt.
Notice the fourth line.
"""Only the first occurrence of Kumar is changed to Roy, not the second one."""
Sixth line had one occurrence of the word Kumar and this is replaced now.
"""So, we see only the first entry of the lines has been changed."""
"""This is because, by default, the first matched entry of any line is substituted."""
"""To substitute all the matched entries, we need to use the flag  g option."""
Let me clear the prompt.
Type:  sed space within single quotes 's front slash opening square bracket small k capital K closing square bracket umar slash Roy slash g' after the single quote space seddemo.txt press Enter.
"""Now, both entries of the fourth line are replaced."""
We can make multiple substitutions in one go as well.
"""Say, we want to replace the word  """"electronics"""" with the word """"electrical"""""""
"""and """"civil"""" with """"metallurgy"""" in the file seddemo.txt."""
Let me clear the prompt.
Type:  sed space hyphen e space within single quotes s front slash electronics slash electrical slash g  after the single quote space hyphen e space within single quotes  s front slash civil slash metallurgy
press Enter.
You can see that the words are replaced.
"""Now we want to change the stream of """"Anirban"""" from """"computers"""" to """"mathematics""""."""
"""In such case, we would need to type:"""
sed space within single quotes 'front slash Anirban slash s slash computers slash mathematics slash g'  after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
We see that the stream is changed.
Let us understand what this is.
"""First we write sed, then in single quotes we write the pattern to be matched."""
"""This is """"Anirban""""."""
Now after the slash comes the operation.
This is s that stands for substitution as we have already seen.
"""Then we mention the pattern to be replaced which is """"computers""""."""
"""Then the new word that would be substituted which is """"mathematics""""."""
We can also use sed to add or delete lines in the file.
"""Say, we want to select those lines which do not have stream as """"electronics""""."""
"""For that, we have the d flag."""
Type:  sed space within single quotes front slash electronics slash d after the single quotes space seddemo.txt space greater than sign space nonelectronics.txt
"""To see the contents, type: cat space nonelectronics.txt."""
"""Say, at the start of the file we want to add a line Student Information."""
For that we have the i action.
We need to type: sed space in single quotes '1i space Student Information' after the quote seddemo.txt
You can see the output.
"""In fact, we can enter multiple lines like this."""
"""Say, we want to add the two lines we would do it in a similar way."""
Along with Student Information we also want to add academics in the next year.
"""So, in that case, we would write  sed space in single quotes 1i space Student Information backslash n 2013' after the quotes seddemo.txt."""
press Enter.
Notice backslash n between the string ‘Information’ and ‘2013’.
backslash n prints 2013 in the next line after ‘Student Information’.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt:"""
Substitution Replacement and Insertion.
"As an assignment, use the same text file seddemo.txt and try to replace or substitute name Ankit with Ashish."

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Course Administration in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Course Administration in Moodle Activities and Resources in a course"""
This tutorial is recorded using:  Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04
"""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30"""
Moodle 3.3  and   Firefox web browser
"""You may use any web browser of your choice. However, Internet Explorer should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
This tutorial assumes that your site administrator has set up a Moodle website  and registered you as a teacher.
Learners of this tutorial should have  a teacher login on Moodle
At least one course assigned to them by the administrator some course material uploaded for their respective course
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and open your moodle site.
Login with your teacher username and password details. I am already logged in as teacher Rebecca Raymond.
We are in the teacher’s dashboard.
"""In the navigation menu on the left, notice Calculus under My Courses."""
Please note. All the courses for which you are enrolled as a teacher or student will be listed here.
We updated the course topics and summaries in the preceding tutorials.
"""If you didn’t do so, please refer to the assignments of the preceding tutorials."""
We will now learn about some useful course settings.
Click on the gear icon at the top right of the section.
"""Click on Edit Settings. Then click on Expand All at the right, to expand all the sections."""
"""The settings seen here, were defined by the administrator, when this course was created."""
"""In the General section, we have Course full name. This is the name displayed at the top of the course page."""
Course short name is the name displayed in the course navigation and in course-related emails.
Course category is already set by the admin.
"""We can change Course start date, Course end date and Course ID number, as per our requirements."""
"""Under Description section, see the Course Summary textbox. I will delete the existing content and type the following."""
My students will see this on the front page of my course.
"""Next comes the field Course summary files. These are the files that will be displayed to the students, along with the Course summary."""
"""By default, only jpg, gif and png file types are allowed as Course summary files."""
There are 3 ways to upload a file:  Drag and drop the file in the box.
Click on the Upload or Add icon at the top left. Click on the downward arrow.
"""If you click on Upload or Add icon or on the downward arrow, the File picker dialog box opens."""
Click on Upload a file option on the left menu.
Click on the Browse or Choose File button. Then select the desired file from your machine.
I will select calculus.jpg from my system.
You can give it a different name by typing it in the Save as field.
"""Specify the author and license details in the respective fields. Lastly, click on Upload this file button at the bottom."""
So that’s how we can upload Course summary files.
Next comes Course format.  Course format refers to the way resources and activities are organized for the students.
"""There are 4 options in Format dropdown - Single Activity Format, Social Format ,  Topics Format and  Weekly Format."""
Our admin has selected Topics format. We will let it remain as it is.
Next setting is for Hidden sections. These are basically topics in a course that can be kept hidden from students.
"""This can be useful when there is a certain topic, which is not yet completed by the teacher. This setting determines how to present the Hidden sections to students."""
Choosing this option will display the content in collapsed form to the students.
Choosing this option will hide the content from the students.
"""We will let it remain as default, for now."""
The next drop-down is Course Layout. Click on it.
"""We can choose to show all sections in one page, by selecting this option."""
"""Another option here is Show one section per page. This will split the course over several pages, depending on the number of sections."""
"""We will let it remain on Show all sections in one page, for now."""
Next is the Appearance section.
Notice the Show gradebook to students option. Many activities in the course allow teachers to assign grades.
"""This option determines whether a student can see those grades. This option is set to Yes, by default. We will let it remain as is."""
"""We will change Show activity reports as Yes, if not already selected by default."""
This ensures that a student can see his/her activity reports from his/her profile page.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Compose Options for Emails.
"In this tutorial, we will learn about the email recipients, namely- To, Cc, Bcc, format the email text, attach files to emails, share files via Google Drive, insert a photo or link into an emailand about the "
"For this tutorial, you will need a working Internet connection and a Web browser."
"""For this demonstration, I will be using Firefox web browser."""
Let's begin.
Open your web browser and type: http://gmail.com
The Login page opens.
Enter a username and password in the respective text boxes.
"""If the Login page opens with the username, this means that you have already accessed this account from your machine."""
Enter the password
and click on Sign in button.
We are in our Gmail page.
"""Now, let us look at the options available for writing an email."""
"""So, first let us click on the Compose button."""
The Compose window opens up.
The To segment is where we specify the recipients.
"""It has 3 options, To, Cc and Bcc."""
Cc stands for Carbon Copy and Bcc stands for Blind Carbon Copy.
We have to add the email address of the person to whom we are sending the email in the To field.
Here’s a screenshot.
"""If we want to send the same email to more than 1 person, simply add the email-ids in the field To."""
Here’s a screenshot.
Use Cc option to mark a copy of the email to others.
All the recipients marked in To and Cc fields can see all the other recipients.
Here’s a screenshot.
We can also use Bcc option to mark a blind copy of the email to others.
"""In this option, the recipients in To and Cc cannot see the recipients added in the Bcc."""
The recipient in the Bcc can see the To and Cc recipients
but not the other Bcc recipients.
The sender of the mail can see the complete recipients list.
Important Note:
"""We can add any number of email-ids in the recipients field - To, Cc and Bcc."""
But the maximum limit is 500 recipients per day.
Each mail-id has to be separated by a space or comma or colon.
Let us now switch back to our Gmail Compose window.
"""By default, the cursor is in the To field."""
Let's enter the recipient addresses as follows-
"""In To field, let's give the email-id as """"ray.becky.0808@gmail.com""""."""
"""In Cc field, """"0808iambecky@gmail.com""""."""
"""In Bcc field, """"stlibreoffice@gmail.com"""" and """"info@spoken-tutorial.org""""."""
Click in the Subject line and enter a short description for your email.
"""I will type: Partner with us""""."""
"""In the contents area, let us type the message:"""
Spoken Tutorial Project is helping to bridge the digital divide.
Gmail allows us to do basic formatting to the text in the body of our email.
"""It is displayed, by default, at the bottom of the Compose window."""
"""If not, to access the formatting toolbar, click the Formatting options button."""
"""Here, we have options such as different Font, Size, Bold, Italic, Underline, Text color, Align, Numbered and Bulleted lists and Indentation."""
These options are exactly like the ones in any word processor application.
You may explore these options by yourself.
This is how I have formatted my text.
"""To hide the formatting toolbar, click the Formatting options button."""
"""In the Compose window, there are options for attaching files, photos, links and emoticons."""
"""To share files or documents with others,"""
"""we can use Attach files or Insert files using Drive"""" options."""
All Mail providers allow to send files as attachment.
You can attach up to 25 megabytes (MB) in size.
"""To send files that are larger than this, you can use Insert files using Drive option."""
Let us first attach a 'pdf file' which is less than 1Mb in size.
Click on the Attach file icon which looks like a paper clip.
This will open the file browser.
Browse and select the file you want to send via mail.
"""From the Desktop, I will select """"myscript.pdf"""" and click on Open."""
We can see that our file is getting attached to our mail.
Multiple files can also be attached to the same mail by using Attach files option.
"""To remove a file you've attached to a message, click on the 'x' mark to the right of the filename."""
"""Now, let us attach a file which is around 30Mb."""
I have a zip file on my Desktop which is around 30Mb file size.
Click the Attach files icon once again.
Browse and select the 30Mb zip file and click on Open.
We will get the popup message:
"""""""The file you are trying to send exceeds the 25mb attachment limit""""."""
And it gives us the option to Send using Google drive.
Click on Send using google drive button.
Let me close this for a moment.
Clicking on Insert files using Drive option also gets us to the same window as before.
"""Here, we can see 3 tabs:"""
"""My Drive, Shared with me and Upload."""""""
"""By default, the files which are already uploaded, will be available under My Drive tab."""
Here you can see a file.
This was shared by Google Team at the time of account creation.
Let’s click on Shared with me tab.
"""Here we see the message- """"No one's shared any files with you yet!"""""""
"""If anyone shares a file with you, it will be available under Shared with Me tab."""
"""Now, click on Upload tab to upload a new file."""
Click on Select files from your computer button.
"""Browse and select the file, from your machine, that you want to upload and click on Open ."""
"""Click on Add more files button, if you want to add any more files."""
I will skip this for now and proceed with the single file upload only.
"""After the file has been added, we have to mention how it has to be inserted in our mail."""
Notice 2 buttons at the bottom right which say-
Insert as Drive link and
Attachment.
"""By default, Insert as Drive link is selected."""
If we select Attachment then the file will be inserted as an attachment.
We will leave it as it is.
Click on the Upload button at the bottom left corner of the screen.
It will start uploading but this may take some time depending on your internet speed.
"""Once complete, here, in the content area, we can see a link to the uploaded file."""
Now let’s click on Insert Photo option to insert images in the email.
The Upload Photos window opens.
We can upload photos from our computer or by giving the website address of the image.
"""For now, I don't want to upload any image."""
"""So, I will click on Cancel button."""
You may explore this option on your own.
The next option is Insert Link. Let’s click on it.
The Edit Link dialog-box opens.
"""In the Text to display field, type the text that you want as the link."""
I will type Spoken Tutorial.
"""In the Link to section, by default, the Web address option is selected."""
"""In the text field, type the url as http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
and click on OK button.
"""Now, in the content area, you can see the text Spoken Tutorial and it is hyperlinked."""
Let me click on the hyperlinked text.
A small pop window opens below the text.
It says- Go to link:.
"""Clicking on the URL displayed, will take you to the Spoken Tutorial website’s Homepage."""
"""To change the URL or remove the link, we can click on Change or Remove options respectively."""
We can also insert various pictorial representations with the help of this emoticon icon.
Use this feature in your email communication wherever required.
Notice the text Saved just before the Trash icon.
"""Whenever we add or remove content, our email will be auto-saved in our default Drafts folder."""
"""This is very helpful to retrieve our typed message, in case of a power failure or Internet disconnection."""
"""If we want to discard this message, click on the Trash icon."""
This action will delete the email from the Drafts folder as well.
Click on the More options button which is next to the Trash icon.
Default to full-screen option will make the Compose window bigger.
Label – We will learn about this feature in the future tutorials.
Plain text mode option will clear all the formatting we did before and convert the mail to plain text.
Print option will send the composed mail to the default configured printer.
Check Spelling will do spell-check of the typed content.
We are now ready to send our mail.
Click on Send button.
We get the following message on the screen-
This Drive file isn't shared with all recipients.
"""This is because we did not share the file with the people who are marked on this email."""""""
Click on Share & Send button.
"""On the screen, we will see either of the two messages:"""
"""Your message is """"sending"""""""
"""or """"Your message has been sent""""."""
"""To view the sent mail, click on View Message link."""
We can see the contents of the email which we sent here.
Let us cross-check one-by-one.
Here are the attachments
and here is the URL link.
"""Below the mail address, there is an inverted triangle that shows the header details."""
Let me click on it.
"""We can see the email-ids of all the recipients in To, Cc and Bcc fields."""
Let us see how the email will appear to the recipients.
This is the mail-id of the recipient marked in Cc.
You can see the message which is sent now. Let me open this to read.
Click on Show Details.
It displays To and Cc but not the Bcc recipients.
This is the mail-id of one of the recipient marked in Bcc.
You can see the message which is sent now.
Let me open this to read.
"""You can see To, Cc and Bcc recipient details."""
Let me come back to the sender’s gmail account.
"""Look over here, we mentioned 2 recipients in the Bcc."""
But here we can see only one email id. The other one is not visible.
This is how the Bcc feature works.
Hope you are able to understand the differences clearly.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about:"""
"""The email recipients namely, To, Cc, Bcc"""

"""Next, go to the tab 022 ISSN."""
Locate the two blank boxes adjacent to 022 question mark.
Note that when you click on the ? (question mark) then the entire MARC 21 Bibliographic format for the respective tag 022 opens up.
"""Here, both the indicators are undefined."""
"""Now, let us go back to the Koha interface."""
"""So, I will skip the two blank boxes."""
"""Next, locate the sub-field ‘a’ International Standard Serial Number."""
Enter an 8 digit Journal ISSN.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Tokens in C and C Plus Plus.
"""In this tutorial we will learn , how to define and use tokens."
We will do this with the help of an example.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10,"" gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with an introduction.
"""Token is a generic word for data types, variables, constants and identifiers."""
Let us start with our program.
I have already typed the code on the editor.
Let me open it.
Note that our file name is 'tokens.c'.
In this program we will initialize the variables and print their values.
Let me explain the code now.
This is our main function.
"""Here, int is a keyword."""
The compiler knows the meaning of keyword.
a is an integer variable.
We have assigned a value of 2 to it.
This is called as initialization.
If a value is not assigned to a variable then it is called as declaration of the variable.
"""Here, b is a constant."""
We have initialized 'b' by assigning a value of 4 to it.
const keyword is used to create 'read only' variable.
Let us switch back to our slides to know more about keywords and constant.
Keywords have fixed meanings that cannot be changed.
Keywords cannot be used as variable names.
There are 32 keywords in C.
"""To name some, auto, break, case, char, enum, extern, etc."""
Constants: constants are fixed values.
They do not change during the execution of a program.
"""There are two types of constants, Numeric constants and Character constants."""
Now come back to our program.
"""Here, float is a data type of variable c."""
We have assigned it a value of 1.5.
Data type is a finite set of values along with a set of rules.
"""Here, d is a variable."""
char and single quotes suggest that we are dealing with a character.
"""As a result, d is a character variable  storing the value A."""
"""It is easy to see that int, double, float and char are data types."""
"""a, c and d are variables."""
Now come back to our slides.
We will know more about data types and variables.
Data types: Let us begin with integer data type.
It is declared as int.
"""If we want to print an integer data type , we will use %d as the format specifier."""
"""Similarly, we will use float and %f for floating point numbers."""
"""For character data type, we will  use char and %c."""
"""And For double data type, we will use double and %lf as the format specifier."""
Now we will see the range of data types.
Integer data type has a range of this
Floating point has a range of this
Character has a range of this
And Double has a range of this
The values stored in the variable must not be greater or less than this range.
Now we will move on to variables.
Variable is a data name.
It may be used to store a data value .
The values can change when a program runs.
Before using a variable it must be declared.
We should try to give meaningful names to  variables.
"""example john, marks, sum etc."""
Now we will move back to our program.
"""Here, printf is the identifier name for this function."""
Come back to our slides.
Let us know about identifiers.
Identifiers are user defined names.
An identifier consists of letters and digits.
Both uppercase and lowercase letters are permitted.
First character must be an alphabet or underscore.
Now Come back to our program.
Here we have initialized the variables and constants.
Here we print them.
And this is our return statement.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute the program.
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space tokens dot c space hyphen o tok. Press Enter."""
"""To execute, type ./tok (dot slash tok)."""
The output is displayed.
We can see that here we have six values after the decimal point.
And here we have two values.
Now let us find out how this happened. Come back to our program.
This is because we have % point 2f here.
It denotes that we can print only two values after the decimal point.
Suppose here I want an output with three decimal places.
Let us replace % point 2f with % point 3f.
Now click on Save.
Come back to our terminal.
"""Compile as before, execute as before."""
We see here three values after the decimal point.
Now we will execute the same program in c++.
Come back to our program.
I will change a few things here.
First press Shift+Ctrl+s keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Now save the file with an extension .cpp and click on Save.
Let us change the header file as iostream
Now  include the using statement.
And click on Save.
Now replace the printf statement with the  cout  statement since we use cout<< function to print a line in C++.
Click on Search for and replace text option.
Type here printf opening bracket “(”
"""And here in this column type, cout and two opening angle brackets “<<”."""
Now click on Replace All  and click on Close.
We don't need the format specifier and ''
Let us delete them.
Now delete the comma and  type two opening angle brackets.
Click on Save. Now delete the closing bracket.
Type two opening angle brackets again.
And within the double quotes type .
Let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space  tokens dot cpp space hyphen o space tok1."""
Here we have tok1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter tok for the file tokens.c.
Now press Enter.
"""To execute, type ./tok1 . Press Enter."""
Now let us move on to some common errors which we can come across.
Suppose here I will reassign a new value to b as 8.
Now click on Save. Let us see what happens.
Come back to our terminal.
Let me clear the prompt.
Now compile as before.
We see an error at line no.7 in our tokens. cpp file.
"""""""Assignment of read only variable 'b' """"."""
This is because 'b' is a constant. Constants are  fixed values.
They do not change during the execution of program.
Hence it is giving an error. Let us fix the error.
Delete this. Click on Save.
Let us execute again. Come back to our terminal.
Compile as before.
"""Execute as before. Yes, it is working."""
Now we will see another common error.
Switch back to our program.
Suppose here I will miss the single quotes. Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to our  terminal.
Compile as before.
We see an error at line no.9 in our tokens dot cpp file.
""""""" 'A' was not declared in the scope"""". Come back to our program."""
This is because anything within the single quotes is considered as a character value.
And here we have declared 'd' as a character variable.
Let us fix the error. Type single quotes at line no.9 here.
Now Click on Save. Let us execute.
Now Compile as before.
Execute as before. Yes it is working.
Now switch back to our slides.
"""Let us summarize.In this tutorial we learnt,"""
"""Data types eg. int, double, float etc."""
Variables eg. int a=2;
Identifiers eg. printf() and

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Structures in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial we will learn,"""
What is a Structure.
Declaration of a structure.
We will do this through an example.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating System  version 11.10, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with an introduction to Structure .
"""When one or more variables are grouped under one name, it is known as structure."""
Structure is used to group different data into one object.
It is called as compound data-type.
It is used to group related information together.
Now we will see the syntax to declare a structure.
"""Here, the keyword struct tells the compiler that a structure is declared."""
strcut_name is the name of the structure.
eg. struct employee;
You can give any name.
Now we will see how to declare a structure variable.
The syntax for this is:
struct struct_name and  struct_var;
struct_var is the variable of type struc_name.
"""example, struct employee addr;"""
addr is the variable of type employee.
Let us move on to our example.
"""I have already typed the program on the editor. So, let me open it."""
Note that our file name is structure.c.
In this program we will calculate the total marks of three subjects using structure.
Here we have declared a structure as student.
"""Then we have declared three integer variables as English, maths and science."""
Variables defined under the structure are called as members of the structure.
Here we have declared an integer variable 'total'.
"""Now we have declared a structure variable stud, stud is the variable of type student, it is used to access and modify the structure members."""
"Here we have modified the members by assigning them values as 75, 70 and 65."""
Here we calculate the total of three subjects.
Then we print the result.
Now click on Save .
"Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space structure.c space hyphen o space struct and press Enter."""
"""To execute, type (dot slash)./struct. Press Enter."""
The output is displayed as: Total is 210
Now we will execute the same program in C++ .
I will edit the same code.
"""First press Shift, Ctrl and  S keys simultaneously on the keyboard."""
Now save the file with an extension .cpp
and click on save.
Let's change the header file as iostream.
Now include the using statement
and click on save.
Structure declaration in C++ is same as in C.
"""So, no need to change anything here."""
At the end we will replace the printf statement with the cout  statement.
Delete the format specifier and (backslash n) .
Now delete the comma.
"""Here, delete the closing bracket"""
and type two opening angle brackets.
"""And within the double quotes, type  (backslash n)."""
Now click on Save.
Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space structure.cpp space hyphen o space struct1 ."""
Here we have struct1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameters struct for the file structure.c .
"""To execute, type (dot slash) ./struct1. Press Enter."""
The output is displayed as:Total is 210
You can see that the output is same as our C code.
Now let us go back to our slides.
"""We will summarize now. In this tutorial we learned,"""
"""Structure, Syntax of a structure"""
eg. struct struct_name;
To access members of a structure.
Eg: stud.maths = 75;
And to add the structure variables.
Eg: total = stud.eng + stud.maths + stud.science;
"As an assignment, write a program to display  records of an employee. like name, address, designation, and salary."

Welcome to the tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""So, what is the problem with this image here?"""
There is nothing properly visible what is there on this board.
"""So, I want to have this writing here to pop out."""
"""I want to keep the sky as it is, so I double this layer and I choose the Curves tool"""
and look into this part of the image.
I pull the curve up to get it lighter.
This looks quite good and now I am pulling this black point further up to get a bit dark here.
I think this should work out.
"""Now, I want the writing on the sign board into the bottom image."""
"""So, I choose a layer mask and fill the layer mask with Black."""
"""Now, I am back to my old image and work on the layer mask which has a white border."""
Now I select the Paint tool here
and select White as my Foreground Colour.
I select a Brush and enlarge it.
"""And now, I am painting on the layer mask."""
And perhaps I should zoom into the image.
This is better.
That's good.
You can see the keys which are pressed in my key indicator.
This looks way better.
Now I double this layer again and select Overlay mode and go down a bit with the Opacity to get a little bit more pop into background.
I think this looks better now.
Now I am ready to save this image.
"""I am working on copies here, so I can just click on Save or press Ctrl + S and of course I don’t want to save all these layers here and I am saving this as JPEG image."""
"""For uploading this image to the web, there is a need to resize it. So, I go to Image, Scale Image and I am scaling this down to 600 in Width."""
"""Now, I have to sharpen this a bit. So, I go to Filters >> Enhance >> Sharpen."""
I check for the art effects in the image and here you can see some light.
Now I am saving this as a copy.
"""I name it """"small"""" and save it."""
And I am finished with this image.
You should always remember two things while editing.
"""First is, if you want to change one part of the image and keep all the rest intact, then make a copy of that layer and do your changes and then put a layer mask on."""
Black hides the image and white reveals the stuff that’s in there.
"""Second thing, if you put second layer over it in Overlay mode, the image will have a better contrast and colours."""
These are two tricks to get very fast edit.
"""In this image, you can see at least two problems."""
"""First, I cut off the feet of these people which would have been nice to have them in there."""
And the second problem is these buildings are falling into the image because I held the camera upwards.
I select the Perspective tool.
I select Corrective (Backward) in the Direction dialog and I select the Grid as Preview.
I can select an Outline or the Image but I select the Grid.
"""And when I click into the image, I get this info. window here, with not so helpful information."""
"""So, I pull it out of way and now I have this grid here and all I have to do is align these grid lines with these verticals in the image."""
These grid lines will be either vertical or horizontal in the output image and this top line will be the top of the image.
"""And so, I am just pulling this over here."""
I look around in the image and I think this is fairly ok.
And now I press Transform.
And we have to wait till it transforms.
And here it is.
Now you see second problem here.
This land is not the best.
"""So, I have to crop this image."""
I go to my Crop tool
"""and I want to crop the side building out and leave only this, in there."""
It looks bit like a square. So I click on Fixed Aspect ratio and keep it as 1 by 1(1:1).
"""Now I have square crop,"""
keeping the people into the image.
I think this crop should work.
"""Click on it, and here it is."""
Now I select the Curves Tool.
Getting the high lines a little bit more up for more contrast into that.
"""Now, this image is finished too."""
This is the next image.
"""So, what to do with this image?"""
I select the Rotate tool and zoom into the image by pressing 1.
"""Here, I look for a good vertical section in the middle of the image and in Direction, I select Corrective (Backward) rotation."""
"""I select Cubic Interpolation and as Preview, I select the Grid."""
"""Now, I click into the image to get the grid lines and now I align these lines with the vertical structures of the house."""
And I think this is it.
I have this little window here open which shows 2.90 degrees and I click on Rotate and wait for the final result .
Here it is.
"""Well, it looks better."""
You can see here that I have plenty of distortion and I should look for the correction of that but now I am cropping this image.
I think this is ok.
I think I haven’t rotated the image properly.
Well! I haven’t rotated enough and I didn't select the right spot.
"""So, let’s do this again."""
I undo the steps back by pressing Ctrl + Z.
I select the Rotate tool again.
I don't change the settings which were selected previously and now I am setting the centre of the image into this TV tower here.
And now just aligning this to a TV tower.
"""The TV tower is the dominant part of the image and so if that isn’t straight, the image feels unstraight."""
This looks better.
And now I take the Crop tool and choose a crop with not too much negative space in it.
"""Now a last thing, perhaps a little bit of curves, to bring a bit more contrast into the image."""
This is OK. Now I am finished with this image.
"""This  image should be in portrait mode. So, I have to change this here."""
I go to Image >> Transform and Rotate 90 degree anticlockwise.
Now I have my image rotated.
"""When we rotate the image 90 degrees, it's without loss in the quality which is specially important with JPEG images."""
Now let’s get a little bit more contrast to this image and I use the Curves tool for doing that.
"""You can use Levels tool or others but I think, for me, the Curves tool is the best."""
Just put a slight ‘S’ curve on it and I think we are done. So I save this image.
"""Now, the next image."""
"""To put it all together, for quick editing of your images you need some basic tools."""
"""First, the Rotate tool."""
Use Corrective mode and the Grid as Preview and align the grid with the verticals or horizontals.
"""Then for tilting lines, you need the Perspective tool."""
Again use the Corrective mode and the Grid and align the grid with these verticals and horizontals.
"""For correcting the contrast and the lightness of the image, select the Curves tool and apply an ‘S’ curve. It is helpful in most cases. Or in some cases, if you want a softer image then inverted ‘S’ curve an"
And go to Image >> Transform menu where you can rotate the image and scale the output size.
"""Finally, Filters is important for quick editing."""
Go to Enhance and Sharpen.
"""After applying a lot of tools, as for example rotating or transformation tool, perspective tool or resizing, the image will get softer."""
And with sharpening you can redo that.
You should get familiar with layers.
"""First, double the layer and for example check out what happens in Overlay mode or other modes."""
There is a lot to explore and I will cover these in sometime.
"""You see, every time I change the Layer mode, I get a fully different image."""
"""And if you want to change only one  part of the image, add a layer mask and fill the stuff you want to see in the image with white."""
"""And the stuff you don’t want to see, in black."""
Gray is partly visible and it's transparent.
"""And I think, this was it for this week."""
And I hope to see you again next week. Good Bye.

Hello everyone.Welcome to this tutorial on Parsing Data.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to download FASTA and GenBank files from NCBI database website."""
"""And, Parse data files using functions in Sequence Input/Output module."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate biochemistry or bioinformatics"""
and basic Python programming.
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
"To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu OS version 14.10, Python version 2.7.8"
Ipython interpretor version 2.3.0
Biopython version 1.64 and * Mozilla Firefox browser 35.0.
"""Scientific data in biology is generally stored in text files such as FASTA, GenBank, EMBL, Swiss-Prot etc."""
Data files can be downloaded from the database websites.
"""Open the website link given below, in any web browser."""
A web-page opens.
Let us download FASTA and GenBank files for human insulin gene.
"""In the search box, type: """"human insulin"""", click on Search button."""
The web-page shows many files for human insulin gene.
"""For demonstration, I will select 4 files with the name “Homo sapiens Insulin mRNA”."""
I will choose files that have less than 500 base pairs.
"""Click on the check-box to select the file, to download."""
"""Bring the cursor to the “Send to” option, located at the top right corner of the page."""
"""Click on the small selection button with a down arrow, present next to the “Send to” button."""
"""Under the heading “Choose destination”, click on File option."""
"""You can save this file in any file format, listed under format drop-down list box."""
Choose FASTA from the given options.
Then click on Create file option.
A dialog-box appears on the screen.
"""Select Open with, click on OK."""
A file opens in a text editor.
"""The file shows 4 records, since we had selected four files to download."""
The first line in each record is an identifier line.
It starts with a “greater than (>)” symbol.
This is followed by a sequence.
Save the file in your home folder as “sequence.fasta'”.
Close the text editor.
"Follow the same steps as above, to download the files in GenBank format for the same files selected earlier."
Select the file format as GenBank.
Create a file. Open with a text editor.
Notice that the sequence file in GenBank format has more features than a FASTA file.
"""Save the file as """"sequence.gb"""" in your home folder. Close the text editor."""
"""For demonstration purpose, we need a FASTA file with a single record."""
"""For this, clear the earlier selection by again clicking on the check boxes."""
"""Now, select the file “Human insulin gene complete cds”."""
Click on the check-box.
And follow the same steps shown earlier to save the file in the home folder.
"""Save the file as """"insulin.fasta""""."""
Biological data stored in these files can be extracted and modified using Biopython libraries.
Close the text-editor.
Extracting data from data files is called as Parsing.
Most file formats can be parsed using functions available in SeqIO module.
"""Most commonly used functions of SeqIO module are: parse, read, write and convert."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and t keys simultaneously."""
"""Start Ipython by typing """"ipython"""" at the prompt. Press Enter."""
"""Next, import """"SeqIO"""" module from Bio package."""
"""At the prompt, type: from Bio import SeqIO. Press Enter."""
We will start with the most important function “parse”.
"""For demonstration, I will use a FASTA file that has many records which we had downloaded earlier from the database."""
"""For simple FASTA parsing, type the following at the prompt."""
"""Here, we are using the parse function to read the contents of the sequence.fasta file."""
"""For the output, print record id, sequence present in the record and also the length of the sequence."""
Also notice that the parse function is used to read sequence data as Sequence record objects.
It is generally used with a for loop.
"""It can accept two arguments, the first one is the file name to read the data."""
The second specifies the file format.
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
"""The output shows the identifier line, followed by the sequence contained in the file, also the length of the sequence for all the records in the file."""
Notice that the FASTA format does not specify the alphabet.
"""So, the output does not specifies it as a DNA sequence."""
The same steps can be repeated for parsing GenBank file.
For Demonstration we will use the GenBank file which we have downloaded earlier from the database.
Press up-arrow key to get the lines of code which we had used earlier.
Change the file name to sequence.gb .
Change the file format to genbank.
The rest of the code remains same.
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
"""Here too the output shows the record id, sequence and the length of the sequence for all the records in the file."""
Notice that the GenBank format specifies the sequence as DNA sequence.
"""Similarly, Swiss-prot and EMBL files can be parsed using the same code as above."""
If your file contains a single record then type the following lines for parsing.
"""Here, we will use the previously saved FASTA file with a single record, that is, insulin.fasta as an example."""
Notice that we have used read function instead of parse function. Press Enter.
The output shows the contents for the file insulin.fasta.
It shows the sequence as sequence record object.
"""And other attributes such as GI, accession number and description."""
We can also view the individual attributes of this record as follows.
"""At the prompt, type: record dot seq. Press Enter."""
The output shows the sequence present in the file.
"""To view the identifiers for this record, type: record dot id. Press Enter."""
The output shows the GI number and accession number etc.
You can use the function described above to parse the data files of your choice.
"""Now, let's summarize."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:to download FASTA and GenBank files from NCBI database website and use parse and read functions from the SeqIO module"""
"""to extract data such as record ids, description and sequences from FASTA and GenBank files."""
"""Now, for the assignment-"""
Download FASTA files for nucleotide sequence of your choice from NCBI database.
Convert the file of sequences to their reverse complements.
Your completed assignment should have the following lines of code.
Use parse function to load nucleotide sequences from the FASTA file.
"""Next, print reverse complements using the Sequence object’s built in reverse complement method."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Extensions in Mozilla Firefox.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Extensions or Add-ons, installing Extensions, recommended Extensions."""
Here we are using Firefox 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04.
"""By default, the yahoo home page opens."""
What are Extensions or Add-ons?
Extensions allow you to:
Add new features to the Firefox browser.
Enhance existing features.
Customize the Firefox browser to suit your preferences.
Extensions are a part of the Firefox browser
and extend the browser’s capabilities.
"""For example, you can install extensions that:"""
Block advertisements or pop-ups.
Compare prices of commodities and even
display weather updates.
Let’s install the Grab and Drag extension.
Grab and Drag let’s you scroll through web pages in various ways.
It is similar to the 'grab and drag' function in Adobe Acrobat.
"""From the Menu bar, click Tools and Add-ons."""
The Add-ons Manager tab opens.
"""Alternately, you can also press the Ctrl+Shift+A keys together to open the Add-ons Manager tab."""
The left panel in Add-ons Manager displays the available options.
"""Notice, by default the option Get Add-ons is selected."""
The right panel displays information for the option selected in the left panel.
"""So, the right panel defines Add-ons and tells you how to get started with add-ons."""

Welcome to this tutorial on Manipulating Sequences.
"""In this tutorial, we will use Biopython tools: To generate a random DNA sequence"""
Slice a DNA sequence at specified locations
Join two sequences together to form a new sequence that is to concatenate
Find the length of the sequence
Count the number of individual bases or part of the string
Find a particular base or part of the string.
Convert a sequence object to a mutable sequence object.
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics"""
and basic Python programming.
"""If not, refer to the Python tutorials at the given link."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: * Ubuntu OS version 14.10"""
Python version 2.7.8
Ipython interpreter version 2.3.0
Biopython version 1.64.
Let me open the terminal and start ipython interpreter.
"""Press Ctrl, Alt and t keys simultaneously."""
"""At the prompt, type: """"ipython"""" and press Enter."""
Ipython prompt appears on the screen.
"""Using Biopython, we can generate a sequence object for a random DNA sequence of any specified length."""
Let us now generate a sequence object for a DNA sequence of 20 bases.
"""At the prompt, type: """"import random"""", press Enter."""
"""Next, import Seq module from Bio package."""
Often Seq is pronounced as seek.
"""At the prompt, type: From Bio dot Seq import Seq. Press Enter."""
We will use Bio.Alphabet module to specify the alphabets in the DNA sequence.
Type: from Bio dot Alphabet import generic underscore dna. Press Enter.
Type the following command to create a sequence object for the random DNA sequence.
Store the sequence in a variable dna1.
"""Please note: in this command, use two single quotes instead of a double quote. Press Enter."""
"""For the output, type: dna1. Press Enter."""
The output shows the sequence object for the random DNA sequence.
"""If you want a new sequence, press up-arrow key to get the same command as above. Press Enter."""
"""For the output, type the variable name dna1. Press Enter."""
The output shows a new DNA sequence which is different from the first one.
About Sequence Objects:
The sequence objects usually act like normal Python strings.
"""So, follow the normal conventions as you do for Python strings."""
"""In Python, we count the characters in the string starting from 0, instead of 1."""
The first character in the sequence is position zero.
Back to the terminal.
Often you may need to work with only a part of the sequence.
"""Now, let's see how to extract parts of the string and store them as sequence objects."""
"""For example, we will slice the DNA sequence at two positions."""
"""First, between bases 6 and 7."""
This will extract a fragment from the beginning of the sequence to the 6th base in the sequence.
The second slice will be between bases 11 and 12.
The second fragment will be from the 12th base to the end of the sequence.
"""Type the following command, at the prompt, to extract the first fragment."""
String1 equal to dna1 within brackets 0 colon 6.
string1 is the variable to store the first fragment.
The rest of the command follows as in normal Python.
Enclosed in these brackets are the start and the stop positions separated by a colon.
The positions are inclusive of the start but exclusive of the stop position. Press Enter.
"""To view the output, type: """"string1"""", press Enter."""
The output shows the first fragment as the sequence object.
"""To extract the second string from the sequence, press up-arrow key and edit the command as follows:"""
Change the name of the variable to string2 and positions to 11 and 20.
"""For the output, type: """"string2"""". Press Enter."""
Now we have the 2nd fragment also as a sequence object.
"""Let us concatenate, that is, add the two strings together to form a new fragment."""
Store the new sequence in a variable dna2.
Type: dna2 equal to string1 plus string2. Press Enter.
Please note: we cannot add sequences with incompatible alphabets.
"""That is, we cannot concatenate a DNA sequence and a protein sequence to form a new sequence."""
The two sequences must have the same alphabet attribute.
"""To view the output, type: """"dna2"""". Press Enter."""
The output shows a new sequence which is a combination of string1 and string2.
"""To find the length of the new sequence, we will use len function."""
"""Type: """"len"""" within parenthesis """"dna2"""". Press Enter."""
Output shows the sequence as 15 bases long.
We can also count the number of individual bases present in the sequence.
"""To do so, we will use count() function."""
"""For example- to count the number of alanines present in the sequence, type the following command: dna2 dot count within parenthesis within double quotes alphabet A."""
The output shows the number of alanines present in the sequence dna2.
"""To find a particular base or part of the string, we will use find() function."""
"""Type: dna2 dot find within parenthesis within double quotes """"GC"""". Press Enter."""
The output indicates the position of the first instance of the appearance of GC in the string.
Normally a sequence object cannot be edited.
"""To edit a sequence, we have to convert it to the mutable sequence object."""
"""To do so, type: dna3 equal to dna2 dot to mutable open and close parenthesis. Press Enter."""
"""For the output, type: dna3. Press Enter."""
Now the sequence object can be edited.
Let us replace a base from the sequence.
"""For example- to replace a base present at 5th position to alanine, type: dna3 within brackets 5 equal to within double quotes alphabet A.  Press Enter."""
Observe the output. The cytosine at position 5 is replaced with alanine.
"""To replace a part of the string, type the following command."""
Dna3 within brackets 6 colon 10 equal to within double quotes ATGC. Press Enter.
The output shows the 4 bases from the position  6 to 9 are replaced with new bases ATGC.
"""Once you have edited your sequence object, convert it back to the “read only” form."""
Type the following dna4 equal to dna3 dot to seq open and close parenthesis. Press Enter.
"""For the output, type: dna4. Press Enter."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt to: *  Generate a random DNA sequence"""
Slice a DNA sequence at specified locations
"""Join two sequences together to form a new sequence, that is, to concatenate."""
"""We have also learnt how to: * use len, count and find functions"""
convert a sequence object to a mutable sequence object and replace a base or part of the string.
"""For the assignment, generate a random DNA sequence of 30 bases."""
"""Using Biopython tools, calculate the GC percentage and molecular weight of the sequence."""
Your completed assignment will be as follows.
The output shows the GC content as percentage.
The output shows the molecular weight of the DNA sequence.

"""So, I will leave it as it is."""
"""If it is not so, on your machine, then select A4 size."""
Let us now change some settings.
Go to File. Click on Document properties.
A dialog box opens up where we can find various tabs and options.
Let us learn about them one by one.
"""In the first tab Page, click on the Default units drop-down list."""
"""As I click one-by-one, observe that the unit of the ruler changes."""
Let me keep the unit as pixels.
Background option helps to change the transparency and color of the background.
"""When we click on it, a new dialog box appears."""
Move the RGB sliders to the left and right.
"""To make the background colour visible on the canvas, move the alpha slider towards the right."""
Now the transparency changes to the selected 'RGB' values.
"""Observe that the color on the background option, in the Document properties window, changes as I move."""
Bring the Alpha slider back to the extreme left and close the dialog box.
"""Under Page size, we find many options."""
We can change the size of the canvas using these options too.
"""As I click, observe the change in the canvas size."""
Let us keep the page size as A4.
Orientation can be changed to either Portrait or Landscape.
Click on both the options and observe the change on the canvas.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Question bank in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:  Question bank in Moodle"""
Categories of questions and How to add questions to the question bank.
This tutorial is recorded using:  Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04
Moodle 3.3   And Firefox web browser You may use any web browser of your choice.
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
This tutorial assumes that your site administrator has registered you as a teacher And assigned at least one course to you.
It also assumes that You have uploaded some course material for your course.
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and login to your Moodle site as a teacher.
"""I have provided a text file with all the text that is used in this tutorial, in the Code files link. Please download the file named “Mytextfile.txt” and open it on your machine."""
Click on the Calculus course in the left navigation menu.
We will begin by learning about Question banks.
"""A Question bank is a collection of questions, mostly organized by topics"""
Questions in the Question bank can be reused in multiple quizzes.
This helps to create different quizzes for each academic year or for different batches.
Switch back to the browser.
Click on the gear icon at the top right and then click on the More… link at the end.
We are brought to the Course Administration page.
Scroll down and locate the section named Question bank.
Click on the Categories link in this section.

Detailed description about the question type is seen on the right side.
I will select Multiple choice.
Click on Add button at the bottom of the pop-up.
"""Now, select the category for which you want to add the question. I will choose Evolutes."""
"""In the Question name field, type MCQ with single correct answer."""
Type the following question in the Question text area. You can copy-paste the text from the Mytextfile.txt file.
The Default Mark is set to 1 and I will let it be as 1.
Next option is General feedback. The text here is shown to the student after he/she has submitted the quiz.
"""This can be used to show the detailed solution of the question, also. Type or copy-paste the text as I have done here."""
"""Now, click on the One or multiple answers dropdown."""
Here we see 2 options- Multiple answers allowed One answer only
I’ll show you how both options work.
Let me first choose One answer only.
"""The Shuffle the choices checkbox is checked, by default. This ensures that the answer choices within the question, are shuffled for each quiz attempt."""
Scroll down to see the Answers section.
Notice that every option here is associated with a grade and feedback.
Type Choice 1 as shown here.
"""Now for this question, Choice 1 is the correct answer."""
Therefore I will select 100% in the Grade.
"""In the Grade dropdown, we can also allot partial marks or negative marks to every choice."""
You can explore these later when you are more proficient with Moodle.
"""Feedback for students who choose this answer, can be written in the Feedback text area. I will type “Correct”."""
"""Fill the rest of the choices and grades, as I have done here."""
Now scroll down and click on Multiple Tries section to expand it.
"""Notice here - the Penalty for each incorrect try field is set by default, to 33.33%"""
This means a student will be penalised for every wrong answer.
You can leave it as it is or change it to any of the other percentage options shown here.
"""I will select 0%, as I don’t wish to penalise my students for wrong answers."""
Then scroll down and click on Save changes button at the bottom of the page.
We can see that our question has been added to the Question Bank.
Notice that there are 4 icons next to the question title of the question.
"""These are to edit, duplicate, preview and delete the question."""
Click on Preview icon to see how the question will appear in the quiz.
The selected question and its options opens in a pop-up window.
"""Click on Fill in correct responses button. This helps you to verify the questions, the choices and the correct answer."""
Click on Submit and finish button.
"""This will show the feedback that the student will see, after answering the question."""
"""Whenever you add a new question, always preview it to cross check."""
Click on Close preview button to close this pop-up window.
Let us now create an MCQ which has more than one correct answer.
"""Following the previous steps, I have created another MCQ. Please do so likewise."""
"""In One or multiple answers dropdown, this time I will select Multiple answers allowed."""
Enter the choices 1 and 2 and their respective grades as shown. Here I have selected 50% grade for both.
A student who marks only 1 correct answer gets 0.5 marks.
And the student who marks both correct answers gets 1 mark.
Enter the choices 3 and 4 and their respective grades as shown.
And I will keep Penalty for each incorrect try field as 0%.
Then scroll down and click on Save changes button.
"""Next, let’s add a Short answer question."""
"""The student will be expected to type in a word or phrase, in response to the question."""
Click on Create a new question button and double-click on Short answer option.
Create the question as shown.
"""In Case sensitivity dropdown, select No, case is unimportant."""
The correct answer to this question is “same logarithmic spiral”
I am willing to give full marks to a student if whose answer is either: “same spiral” or  “same logarithmic spiral”
"""However, if the student writes “logarithmic spiral” as the answer, I will give half mark."""
Scroll down to the answers section.
Fill in Answer 1 and 2 and their respective grades as shown.
Notice the asterix in Answer 1 text. Asterix can be used as a wildcard to match any character.
So for eg: A student writes The evolute of a logarithmic spiral is the same logarithmic spiral. This answer will be awarded full marks.
Fill in Answer 3 and its respective grade as shown.
Notice there is no asterix before the answer text.
So for example: A student writes The evolute of a logarithmic spiral is not the same logarithmic spiral. This answer will be not be awarded any marks.
Fill in Answer 4 and its respective grade as shown.
Notice that I have awarded only 50% marks to this answer.
"""In the feedback textarea, type “You need to specify that it’s the same spiral and not any spiral.”"""
This explanation will be shown to the student as feedback.
"""Once again, I will keep Penalty for each incorrect try field as 0%."""
Then scroll down and click on Save changes button.
Let us now add a Numerical question.
Click on Create a new question button and double click on Numerical option.
"""The answer to this question is 5mm. However, I am okay with the student answering anywhere between 4.5mm and 5.5mm."""
The error margin here is 0.5.
Scroll down to the Answers section.
"""Enter the Answers, Error and grades as shown."""
Expand the Unit handling section. There are 3 options in the Unit handling dropdown.
"""I will select the option - The unit must be given, and will be graded."""
"""The Unit penalty field, by default, shows 0.1 I will make it 0.5."""
So the student will get half of the marks if they write the answer without mentioning the unit.
"""In the Units are input using dropdown, I will select the text input element option."""
This means the student has to type the unit along with the answer.
Expand the Units section.
Write Unit as mm and multiplier is 1. This means the answer choices are in mm.
"""Once again, I will keep Penalty for each incorrect try field as 0%."""
And then scroll down and click on Save changes button.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: Question bank in Moodle"""
Categories of questions and How to add questions to the question bank.
Here is a small assignment for you: Add more questions in the question bank.
Refer to the Assignment link of this tutorial for details.
Pause this tutorial and resume when done.
We should now have 10 questions in this question bank. 6 of them are in Evolutes and 4 in Involutes subcategory.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Method overloading in java.
In this tutorial we will learn:
What is method overloading.
And 	to overload method.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10  OS Java Development kit 1.6 And Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create methods and
to overload constructor in java using eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
What is method overloading?
Define two or more methods with same name within a class.
They must differ in number or types of parameters.
These methods are called overloaded methods.
The process is called method overloading.
Let us now see how to overload a method.
"""In eclipse, I have a class Addition."""
"""Inside the class,  we will  declare two integer variables."""
"""So, type: int a  equal to 10 and int b  equal to 5."""
Let us create a method to add these two integers.
"""So, type:  void add parentheses."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: System dot out dot println();."""
Inside  parentheses a+b.
"""So, this method will give us the sum of two integer variables."""
Let us create another method which takes two parameters.
"""So, type: void addTwoNumbers()."""
Within parentheses int num1 comma int num2.
"""Then, within curly brackets System dot out dot println num1 plus num2."""
"""So, this method will give us the sum of two  values that are passed as arguments to this method."""
Let us create an object of the class and call the methods.
"""So, in  the  main method  type: Addition i.e the class name  obj  equal to new Addition parentheses semicolon."""
Then Obj.add();
And Obj.addTwonumbers();  within parentheses
we  will pass  two arguments.
Suppose if we pass floating point values.
"""So, type 2.5 comma and an  integer 3."""
We get an error. It states that:  The method addTwoNumbers  int comma int  of the  class addition is not applicable for the arguments double comma int.
"""So, what we do is, in the method instead of int we will give double."""
So replace int by double . Save the file.
We also  know that Java automatically i.e. implicitly coverts int into double.
"""So, here we can pass integer arguments as well."""
"""In the output, we see the sum of two integer variables"""
and the sum of two numeric arguments that we passed.
"""Now, we see that both the methods perform same operation."""
The difference is that the first method  has no parameters while the second method has  parameters.
"""So, in such cases java provides us with method overloading."""
"""So, what we do is, give same name to both the methods."""
"""So, replace addTwoNumbers() with add(), also change here."""
We will define one more method with same operation.
"""So, type: void add()."""
Within parentheses int n1 comma int n2 comma int n3.
"""So, we have given three parameters."""
"""Then, within curly brackets System dot out dot println()."""
Within parentheses n1 plus n2 plus n3.
"""So, this method will give sum of three numbers."""
Let us call this method.
"""So, type: obj dot add() 1 comma 5 comma 4."""
Save and Run.
"""In the output, we see the sum of three number i.e 10."""
"""So,Java compiler overloads the proper method depending on the parameters."""
It checks the number and type of parameters passed.
"""So, as a programmer we don't have to worry about the method name."""
Nor even the type or number of arguments we  passed.
We can create one more method which appends strings.
So we will create one more overload  method.
Type: void add String s1 comma String s2.
Within curly brackets System dot out dot println().
Within parentheses s1 plus s2.
Then we will call  this method.
"""So, type: obj dot add."""
Within parentheses in double quotes Hello comma in double quotes space World.
"""So, in the output we see Hello space World."""
"""So, the add method with two string arguments, appends the string."""
Suppose now we declare add method with return type.
"""So, type: int add parentheses  no  parameter and curly brackets."""
"""We get an error.  It states that """"Duplicate method add() in type Addition""""."""
This is because we have already declared a   method add() with no parameters.
"""So, remember that to overload a  method, the parameters must differ."""
Having different return types will not overload the method.
"""So, remove this method  and Save the file."""
This is how method overloading is done in java.
"""So, in this tutorial we learnt:"""
About method overloading.
To overload method.
And advantage of method overloading.
"""For self assessment: Create a method subtract that subtracts number,"""
Overload it.
More information on this mission is available at [1].
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Non-static block in java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
About non-static block
When   a non-static block is executed?
Simple example of non-static block
And Why we need constructors?
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 Java Development Environment jdk 1.6 And  Eclipse IDE 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create a constructor in Java using Eclipse.
"""Now we will see, what a non-static block is."""
Any code written between two curly brackets is a non-static block.
We can see the syntax here.
When is a  non-static block  executed ?
A  non-static block is executed for each object that is created.
It executes before the constructor's execution.
It can initialize instance member variables of the class.
Any other execution like calculation could also be given in the block.
"""Now, let us switch to Eclipse and try to use a non-static block."""
I have already opened a class named NonStaticTest in Eclipse.
I also have a created a class named A .
"""Now inside class A, I will first create a variable of type int."""
"""So, type: int a semicolon, then press Enter."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes Non static block of an instance of Class A semicolon."""
"""Then, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The value of a is plus a semicolon."""
Now we will declare a constructor.
"""So, type: public A opening and closing brackets open the curly brackets press Enter."""
Then type:  System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes Constructing object of type A semicolon.
Then type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The value of a is plus a  semicolon.
Now save this file.
Inside   class NonStaticTest in Eclipse let us create an object of the class A.
"""So, type: A space a1 equal to  new space A opening and closing brackets semicolon."""
"""Next line, we will create one more object of class A."""
"""So, type: A  space a2 equal to new  space A opening and closing brackets semicolon."""
"""Now,  Save and run the file. So, press Ctrl & S and Ctrl & F11 keys."""
We get the output as follows:
"""As we can see when the first object is created, the non-static block is executed."""
Non-static block   of an instance  of class A  and the instance variable 'a' is initialized to 0.
Only after that the constructor is executed. Constructing object of type A.
"""And here, the instance variable is again initialized to 0."""
"""Then again when the second object is created, the non-static block is executed."""
This process is repeated.
We can have multiple non-static blocks in a class.
In this case they execute in the sequence in which they appear in the class.
We can try that now.
Include one more block after the first one in class A.
"""So, again type inside curly brackets:"""
System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes Second Non static block of an instance of Class A semicolon.
Then type: System  dot  out  dot println within brackets and double quotes The value of a is  plus  a  semicolon .
"""Now, save this file , press Ctrl & S key  simultaneously then press  Ctrl & F11   to run the program."""
We get the output as follows.
"""We see that after the first block is executed, the second is executed."""
Only then the constructor is executed.
Now  you might feel why do we need constructors.
The answer is we don't need the default constructor.
But the non-static block cannot be parameterized.
You cannot have objects taking values from out side.
So non-static block is not a substitute for constructor.
"""So, let us summarize."""
In this tutorial we have learnt
about non-static block and how to use this block.
For self assessment: Create a class named B.
Create a non-static block and a constructor as shown in the tutorial.
Create an object of class B in the class NonStaticTest already created.
Check the output.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on First C program.
"""In this tutorial, we  will learn"""
How to write a simple C program
How to compile it
How to execute it We will also explain some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using"""
Ubuntu operating system version 11.10 and gcc Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
"""To practice this tutorial,"""
You should be familiar with Ubuntu Operating System and an Editor.
Some editors are vim and gedit.
I will use 'gedit' in this tutorial.
For relevant tutorials please visit our website which is as shown. http://spoken-tutorial.org
Let me tell you how to write a C program through an example.
"""Open the terminal window  by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""Now let's open the text editor. So, at the prompt, type"""
“gedit” space “talk” dot “c” space “&” sign.
We use ampersand (&) to free up the prompt.
Please note that all the C files will  have  extension  “.c”(dot C).
"""Now Press Enter,"""
the text editor has opened.
Let us start to write a program.
Type double slash “//” space
“My first C program”.
"""Here, double slash is used to comment the line."""
Comments are used to understand the flow of program.
It is useful for documentation.
It gives us information about the program.
The double slash is called as single line comment.
"""Type (hash) “#include” space opening bracket , closing bracket."""
"""It is always a good practice to complete the brackets first, and then start writing inside it."""
"""Now  Inside the bracket, type“stdio” “(dot).” “h” ."""
stdio.h is a header file.
A program must contain this header file when it uses standard input/output  functions.
"""type “int” space “main” opening bracket, closing bracket."""
main is a special function.
It denotes that the execution of the program begins from this line.
The opening bracket and closing bracket is called as parenthesis.
Parenthesis followed by main is to tell the user that main is a function.
Here the int main function takes no arguments.
It returns a value of type integer.
We will learn about data types in another tutorial.
Now  Let us switch to the slides to know more about  main function. Let us go to the next slide.
Every program should have one main() function.
There should NOT be more than one main function.
Otherwise the compiler cannot locate the beginning of the program.
The empty pair of parentheses indicates that main has no arguments.
The concept of arguments will be discussed in detail in the upcoming tutorials.
Now let us come back to our program.
Type opening curly bracket “{”.
The opening curly bracket marks the beginning of the function main.
Then  Type  closing curly  bracket “}”.
The closing curly bracket indicates the end of the function main.
"""Now Inside the bracket   press Enter twice,"""
move the cursor one line up.
Indentation makes the code easier to read.
It also helps to locate errors faster.
So let us give three space here
And  Type “printf”  opening bracket closing bracket “()” .
printf is a standard C function to print the output on the terminal.
"""Here, inside the brackets, within the double quotes."""
"""Anything within the double quotes, in the printf statement, will be printed on the terminal."""
Type“Talk To a Teacher backslash n”.
Backslash n “” signifies newline.
"""As a result, after execution of the printf function, the cursor moves to the new line."""
Every C statement must end with a semicolon “;”.
"""Hence, type it at the end of this line."""
Semicolon acts as a statement terminator.
Now press Enter give three space here.
And type “return” space “0” and a semicolon.
This statement returns the integer zero.
An integer has to be returned for this function because the function type is int.
The return statement marks the end of executable statements.
We will learn more about the returned values in another tutorial.
"""Now click on""""Save"""" button to save the file."""
It is a good habit to save files frequently.
This will protect you from sudden power failures.
It will also be useful in case the applications were to crash.
"""Let  us now compile the program, come back to a  terminal."""
"""Type “gcc” space “talk.c” space hyphen “-o” space “myoutput”,"""
"""gcc is the compiler,"""
talk.c is our filename .
-o myoutput says that the executable should go to the file myoutput.
Now Press Enter.
We see that the program is compiled.
"""By typing ls space (hypen) -lrt, we can see that myoutput is the last file to be created."""
"""To execute the program, type (dot slash)“./myoutput” , press Enter."""
Here the output is displayed as “Talk To a Teacher”.
"""As I said before, return is the last statement to be executed."""
"""Thus, after the return statement nothing will be executed. Let us try it out."""
come back to our program.
"""After the return statement, let us include one more printf statement,"""
"""give space here, type printf opening bracket, closing bracket."""
"""Inside the bracket within the double quotes type Welcome backslash n ,  at the end type a semicolon."""
Now click on   save.
Let us compile  and execute come back to our terminal.
you can recall the previously entered commands by using up arrowkey.
That is what I did now.
We see that the second  statement  welcome is  not executed.
Let us write the 'Welcome' statement above the return statement.
Click on  Save.
Let us compile and execute.
We see that the second printf statement welcome has also been executed.
Now let us see the common errors which we can come across.  Come back to our program.
"""Suppose here I  will miss the dot in “stdio.h”, click on Save."""
Let us  compile and execute .
We see that there is a fatal error  at line no.2 in our talk.c file.
"""The compiler cannot find a header file with the name “stdioh”. Hence it is giving an error """"no such file or directory""""."""
And the compilation is terminated.
"""Let us  now fix the error come back to a  program. Reinsert the dot “.”, click on Save."""
"""Let us compile and  execute. Yes, it is working."""
I will show you another common error.
Let us switch back to the program.
"""Now, suppose here I will miss the semicolon  at the end of the line."""
Click on  Save. Let us compile and execute.
"""We see that there is  an error at line no.6 in our talk.c file. that """"expected ';' (semicolon) before 'printf'""""."""
"""As I said before, semicolon acts as a statement terminator."""
So it will search for it at the end of the line.5 and at the beginning of the  line.6.
This is line 6.
This is the last place where you can put the semicolon.
Recall that the compiler also gives the error message on line 6.
Let us try what happens if we put the semicolon here.
Let us Compile and execute.
Now come back to our program. Let us type the semicolon here at the end of this line
as it is a conventional practice to type  the semicolon at the end of the line.
Let us Compile and execute. Yes it is working.
Now let us go back to our slides.
As an Assignment
"""Write a program to print """"Welcome to the World of C"""""""
See what happens if  “” is not included in the printf statement.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Getting ready for Moodle installation.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the prerequisites for installing Moodle."""
We will also learn to check for packages on localhost and database setup.
"""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30  and Firefox web browser."""
You can use any web browser of your choice.
"""To install Moodle 3.3 in your system, you should have a machine that supports:"""
"""Apache 2.x (or higher version), MariaDB 5.5.30 (or any higher version) and PHP 5.4.4 +(or any higher version)."""
"""If you have older versions of the above, ideally uninstall these before proceeding ahead."""
MariaDB is the fastest growing open source database.
It is an alternative for MySQL database.
"""Web server distributions give you  Apache, MariaDB and PHP bundled in one."""
"""You can either install these separately or using a web server distribution like XAMPP, WAMPP or LAMPP."""
I have already installed XAMPP in my machine.
"""First of all, we should check if XAMPP is running on our machine."""
"""In the web browser, type: http colon double slash 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1  and press Enter."""
It shows a message Unable to connect.
"""This means, XAMPP service is not running."""
"""So, we have to start the XAMPP service."""
Let’s open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T keys together.
Start XAMPP by typing sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash lampp space start.
Enter the administrative password when prompted and press Enter.
If you get a message that says- Starting XAMPP for Linux …. XAMPP: Starting Apache...ok. XAMPP: Starting MySQL...ok. XAMPP: Starting ProFTPD...ok.
It means that XAMPP is installed in your system and you have started the service.
Please note XAMPP 5.6.30 uses MariaDB instead of MySQL.
The commands and tools are the same for both.
Let us go back to the browser and refresh the page.
We can now see the XAMPP screen.
You may get a message saying Command not found in the terminal.
This means XAMPP is not installed in your machine.
"""If so, refer to the XAMPP Installation tutorial in the PHP and MySQL  series on this website."""
Follow the instructions specified in the above tutorial and install the latest version of XAMPP.
Let’s switch back to the terminal.
Now follow the steps shown above to start XAMPP service.
Let us check the version of PHP on our system now.
On the terminal type: sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash bin slash php space hyphen v and press Enter.
"""Enter the administrative password, if prompted, and press Enter."""
My version of PHP is 5.6.30.
This message indicates that PHP  is installed successfully.
"""If you get a version lesser than 5.4.4, you should install the latest version of XAMPP."""
"""Next, let us check the version of MariaDB on our system."""
"""On the terminal, type: sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash bin slash mysql space hyphen v and press Enter."""
"""Enter the administrative password, if prompted, and press Enter."""
My version of MariaDB is 10.1.21
"""If you get a version lesser than 5.5.30, you should install the latest version of XAMPP."""
Please note. You should have XAMPP running to check the versions of PHP and database.
Also note that the command prompt has now changed.
Type backslash q and press Enter  to exit MariaDB.
You may also get other errors as shown here.
You may get a message that says “An apache daemon is already running”.
It means the startup script did not start XAMPP-Apache.
This indicates that there is another Apache instance already running.
"""To start XAMPP properly, you will have to first stop this daemon."""
The command to stop Apache is: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 space stop
You may get a message that says MySQL daemon failed to start.
This means the startup script did not start MySQL.
This indicates that there is another database instance already running.
"""To start XAMPP properly, first you have to stop this daemon."""
This command will stop MySQL: sudo space /etc/init.d/mysql space stop
Resolve all the errors and get XAMPP running successfully.
Then switch to your web browser and refresh the page.
"""If prompted for language selection, select English."""
We will now need to add a user and create a database for Moodle.
We will do this in phpmyadmin which is the graphical user interface for MariaDB.
It comes along with the XAMPP installation.
Let us go back to the browser.
"""On the XAMPP page, in the menu at the top, click on phpMyadmin."""
Click on User Accounts in the top menu and then click on Add User Account.
"""In the new window that opens, enter a username of your choice."""
I will type: moodle hyphen st as my username.
"""From the Host drop-down list, select Local."""
Enter a password of your choice in the Password text-box.
I will type: moodle hyphen st as my password.
Type the same password in the Re-type textbox.
Keep the Authentication Plugin option as it is.
Please do not click on Generate Password prompt for now.
"""Under Database for user account, we can see the option-"""
Create database with same name and grant all privileges.
We will check that option and click the Go button at the bottom right of this page.
We can see a message “You have added a new user” at the top of the window.
It means a new database with the name moodle-st and with a user moodle-st has been created.
"""Make a note of the username, password and database names."""
These will be required later to complete the Moodle installation.
Please note: Database name and username need not be the same.
"""To have different names, create the database first and then create a user for that database."""
"""Also, as per naming convention, username should not have any spaces in between."""
We now have XAMPP running and our database is ready.
We are now ready to install Moodle.
We will continue with the installation of Moodle in the next tutorial.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt:"""
"""about the prerequisites for installing Moodle,"""
"""how to check for the prerequisites, how to setup the database and how to add a user."""
"""The video at the following link, summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project."""

"""Spoken Tutorial project is funded by  MHRD, Government of India."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Array Operations in java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to:"""
import the class Arrays  and
perform basic operations on arrays.
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of arrays in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. [1]"""
The methods for array operations are available in a class called Arrays.
"""To access them, we need to import that class."""
It is done by the statement import java.util.Arrays semicolon.
We can access a method from the class.
We do it by adding a 'dot' and the method name.
"""So, Arrays dot toString means toString method from the  Arrays class."""
Now switch to eclipse.
We have already created a class ArraysDemo.
Let us now import the class Arrays.
The import statement is written before the class definition.
"""So, before public class, type:"""
import java.util.Arrays semicolon
This statement says that java contains a package called util which contains the class Arrays and it has to be imported.
"""Now, let us add an array."""
"""Inside the main function, type:"""
"""int marks open and close square brackets equal to within curly brackets 2, 7, 5, 4, 8"""
Now we shall use a method available in the Arrays class to get a string representation of the array and print it.
"""So, type: String mStr equal to  Arrays dot toString  parentheses  inside parentheses  will give the array name i.e. marks."""
"""Now, this toString method will give the string representation of the array."""
We shall print the marks.
"""So, type System  dot out dot  println inside parentheses type mStr;"""
"""Now, let us look at the output. So save and run the program."""
"""As we can see in the output, the toString method has given a string representation of the array."""
"""Now, let us look at sorting the elements of the array."""
"""So, before the line Arrays dot toString type: Arrays dot  sort within parentheses the Array name i.e marks."""
"""So, the sort method in the Arrays class sorts the elements of the array passed to it."""
Now we are sorting the elements of the array marks and then printing the string form of it.
Let us look at the output. So save and run.
"""As we can see in the output, the sort method has sorted the array in the ascending order."""
Note that the sort method has changed the array itself.
This type of sorting is called inplace sorting.
It means that the array which contains the elements is changed as a result of sorting.
The next method we are going to look at is fill.
The fill method takes two arguments.
Remove the sorting line and
type: Arrays dot fill within brackets the name of the array i.e marks;
"""This is our first argument and second is the value that should be filled in the array, we will give it 6 and semicolon. Save and Run."""
"""As we can see, as the name goes, the fill method fills the array with the given argument i.e 6."""
The next method we are going to look at is copyOf.
We are going to copy all the elements of the array marks into the array marksCopy.
"""So, remove 'arrays dot fill'."""
And type: int marksCopy[];
"""Next line, type: marksCopy = Arrays.copyOf(marks, 5);"""
This method takes two arguments.
The first argument is the name of the  array from which you want to copy the elements.i.e marks.
"""The second is the no.of elements to copy, over here we will copy 5."""
"""Then, in arrays dot toString, change marks to marksCopy."""
Now save and run the program.
We see that the elements of the array marks have been copied to the array marksCopy.
Let us see what happens if we change the no.of elements to be copied.
Let's Change 5 to 3.
Save and Run.
"""As we can see, only the first three elements have been copied."""
Let us see what happens if the no.of elements to be copied is greater than the total no.of elements in the array.
"""So, change 3 to 8."""
Save and Run the program.
"""As we can see, the extra elements have been set to the default value  which is 0."""
"""Next, we'll see how to copy a range of values."""
"""So, change copyOf to copyOfRange and 8 to 1, 4."""
This method copies all the elements starting from  the index 1 and stopping at index 3.
Save and Run.
"""As we can see, the elements from index 1 to  3 have been copied."""
"""Note that we have given 1, 4  as our arguments."""
"""But, even then the element at index 4 has not been copied."""
Only the elements till index 3 have been copied. It stops one index before the given range.
"""So, this behavior ensures that continuity of ranges is maintained."""
"""(0, 4) implies from index 0 to 3."""
"""(4, 6) will imply index from 4 to 5."""
"""So it behaves as if (0, 4) + (4, 6) = (0, 5)."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
How to import the class Arrays.
"""Perform array operations like  toStrings, sort, copy, fill."""
For assignment:
Read about the Arrays.equals method and find out what it does.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Introduction to Tux Typing.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn about  Tux Typing and the Tux typing interface."""
"You will learn how to type accurately, quickly and efficiently on a computer keyboard that has English alphabet keys."""
You will also learn to type without having to look down at the keyboard every time you type.
What is Tux Typing?
Tux Typing is a typing tutor.
It teaches you how to type using interactive games and gradually introduces you to typing different characters.
You can learn typing at your own pace
and gradually increase your typing speed and along with it your accuracy.
Tux typing also enables you to  enter new words for practice and set the language for typing.
"""Here, we are using Tux Typing 1.8.0 on Ubuntu Linux 11.10."""
You can install Tux Typing using the Ubuntu Software Centre.
"""For more information on Ubuntu Software Centre, please refer to the Ubuntu Linux Tutorials on this website."""
Let’s open Tux Typing.
"""First, click Dash Home which is the round button, on the top left corner of your computer desktop."""
"""The Search box appears. In the Search box, next to Dash Home, type """"Tux Typing""""."""
The Tux Typing icon appears beneath the Search box.
Click the 'Tux Typing' icon.
The Tux Typing window appears.
The Tux Typing comprises the following menus:
Fish Cascade – a gaming zone Comet Zap – another gaming zone
Lessons – comprises different lessons that will teach us to learn characters.
"""Options – Comprises menus that help us to edit words, learn to type phrases, get information on the tux typing project and set up the language."""
Quit – click to quit the game.
Let us practice to type using the Lessons.
"""In the Main menu, click Lessons."""
The window comprising the lesson appears.
Let us start by learning the first lesson.
"""Click """"basic_lesson_01.xml""""."""
The window comprising the instructions appears. Read the instructions.
"""To start the lesson, let us press the space-bar."""
"""The window displaying the keyboard, appears."""
We will now start learning to type the letter 'a'.
Press 'p' to start practicing.
"""A window that displays the characters to type, appears."""
What does this line displaying ‘aaa aaa…..’ mean?
You are required to type these letters.
"""Let us name this line as """"Teacher’s line""""."""
We now see the English keyboard which is the standard keyboard used by most of us.
Do you see the red square around 'A'? It indicates that it is the character that you have to type now.
"""The first line of the keyboard displays numerals, special characters and the backspace key."""
You press the backspace key to delete typed characters.
"""The keyboard also has three rows of alphabets, numerals and other characters."""
"""The second line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, few special characters and the Enter key."""
You can press the Enter key to go to the next line.
"""The third line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, colon/semicolon and Caps Lock key."""
Use  the Caps Lock key to type capital letters.
"""The fourth line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, special characters and shift keys."""
Press the shift key together with any other alphabet key to type capital letters.
Press the Shift key with any other key to type a character given at the top of the key.
"""For example, the key with the numeral 1 has the exclamation mark on top."""
"""To type the exclamation mark, press the Shift key together with 1."""
"""The fifth line of the keyboard comprises the Ctrl, Alt and Function keys. It also contains the space bar."""
"""Now, let us see if there are differences between the Tux Typing keyboard, laptop keyboard and desktop keyboard."""
Notice that the Tux Typing keyboard and the keyboards used in desktops and laptops are similar.
"""Now, let’s see the correct placement of our fingers on the keyboard."""
Look at this slide.
"""It displays the fingers and their names. Fingers, from left to right, are named:"""
"Little finger,Ring finger Middle finger,Index finger and Thumb."
On your keyboard place your left hand on the left side of the keyboard.
"""Ensure that the Little finger is on the alphabet 'A',"""
"""Ring finger is on the alphabet 'S',"""
"""Middle finger on the alphabet 'D',"""
Index finger on the alphabet 'F'.
"""Now, place your right hand on the right side of the keyboard."""
"""Ensure that the Little finger is on the colon/semi-colon keystroke,"""
Ring finger on the alphabet 'L'
"""Middle finger on the alphabet 'K',"""
Index finger on the alphabet 'J'.
Use your right thumb to press the space-bar.
The two hand images will guide you to use the right finger to type the character.
Wondering what the red circle of the left-hand little finger is?
Your guess is right. You need to use that finger to type 'a'.
Place your fingers on the keyboard as indicated earlier in the lesson.
"""Now, let us start typing."""
"""As we type, the characters are displayed in the line below the Teacher’s line."""
Let us name this the Student’s line.
"""Now, let’s type a character that is not displayed in the teacher’s line."""
Do you see that mistyped character displayed in the student’s line? It is not displayed.
"""Instead, an 'X' mark briefly appears on the mistyped character on the keyboard."""
Let’s type a few more letters.
"""Now, let us collect the metrics of our typing."""
"""By now, you would have guessed what the fields on the left hand side indicate."""
Time – specifies the speed of your typing.
Chars – indicates the number of characters typed by you.
CPM - indicates the characters per minutes typed by you.
WPM – specifies the number of words typed by you.
Errors – indicates the number of errors typed by you.
Accuracy – indicates the accuracy of your typing.
Press the Escape key twice to go back to the main menu.
We have learnt our first typing lesson!
It is a good practice to first learn to type accurately at lower speeds.
"""Once we learn to type accurately, without mistakes, we can increase the typing speed."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Tux Typing.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about the Tux Typing interface and completed our first typing lesson."""
"""Switch to """"basic_lesson_02.xml""""."""
Practice with this level.
Complete typing all the characters in this level and press the Enter key.
"""Similarly, you can practice different lessons."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create and edit shapes using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will familiarize ourselves with Inkscape."""
We will learn about Inkscape interface and how to: Create basic shapes
Fill color and  Modify shapes using handles.
"""For this tutorial, I am using:  Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.48.4"
Go to Dash home and type: Inkscape.
You can open Inkscape by double-clicking on the logo.
"""On the top of the interface, you will find the menu bar and Tool controls bar."""
This is followed by the rulers at the top and at the side.
"""On the right side of the interface, you will find the Command bar and Snap controls bar."""
The Tool box is located on the left side of the interface.
"""In the centre, is the canvas. This is where you will draw your graphics."""
"""At the bottom of the interface, we can see the color palette and the status bar."""
"""Now, let us learn to create and edit some basic shapes in Inkscape."""
"""First of all, we will learn about Select and Transform tool. It is commonly called as Selector tool."""
It's a very important tool. You will find it on the left hand side of the Tool box.
"""With this tool, you can select objects, transform and move them around on the canvas."""
"""To open a new Inkscape document, click on File and then choose New and click on Default."""
"""To open an existing Inkscape document, click on File and then choose Open."""
Let's open the drawing_1.svg file that we created earlier.
I had saved it in Documents folder. Click on Open button at the bottom right.
We created a rectangle earlier.
"""Now, click on the rectangle."""
"""By default, the color of the rectangle is green."""
"""To change the color to red, we will use the color palette at the bottom."""
"""So, I will move the cursor to the bottom and click on red color."""
Observe the color change in the rectangle.
"""Let us now move the rectangle.To do so, you should click anywhere on the rectangle."""
"""Now, without releasing the mouse button, drag it wherever you want on the canvas."""
Then release the mouse-button.
"""Let us zoom in for a better view. To do so, press Ctrl key and use the scroll button on the mouse."""
Notice arrows around the rectangle. These are called handles which we can use for scaling and rotating.
"""When the cursor is kept on any of the handles, the color of the handle changes."""
This indicates that particular handle is selected and ready for resizing.
"""To scale or resize the rectangle, click and drag on any one of the corner handles."""
"""If you want to keep the aspect ratio same, hold the Ctrl key while resizing."""
"""To change the length or the width of the rectangle, use one of the handles on the sides of the rectangle."""
"""Click and drag the handle, either to the left or to the right."""
Observe the change in the width of the rectangle.
"""Now, let's change the height of the rectangle."""
"""So, we will click and drag on either the top or the bottom handle."""
Observe the change in the height of the rectangle.
We can also change the width and height of the rectangle manually by changing the Width and Height parameters on the Tool controls bar.
I will change the Width to 400 and Height to 200.
Notice the change in the size of the rectangle.
"""In a similar way, you can also move the object by changing the X and Y axes positions."""
"""Now, let's learn how to rotate the rectangle."""
"""To do so, click on the rectangle once again."""
Notice that now the shape of the corner handles has changed to indicate that it is ready for rotation.
I will click on the top right corner handle and rotate the rectangle.
You can also skew the rectangle by clicking and dragging any of the side handles.
I am clicking the left middle handle and dragging it up and down to skew the rectangle.
Observe the changes as I do so.
We will learn some more details on using these handles in another tutorial.
Let us unselect this shape now.
"""To do so, click anywhere in the canvas area or outside the canvas boundary."""
Let me move the mouse back to the Tool box and over the same rectangle tool.
The tool tip says that we can draw rectangles and squares using this tool.
"""So, first let me click on this tool."""
"""To draw a square, simply hold the Ctrl key and drag on the Canvas."""
Let me change its color to pink.
An assignment for you.
Select the Create circles and ellipses tool from the Tool box.
"""Use the Ctrl key, draw a circle on the canvas."""
Color it blue.
This is my circle.
Now let us learn how to modify this circle.
You can change the Start and the End parameters to alter the shape of the circle to an arc or a segment.
There are 3 options here on the Tool controls bar which help to switch between the shapes.
Let me change the Start parameter to 100 and End parameter to  -50.
We see that the circle shape has now changed to a segment shape.
Now I will click on Arc icon and we see the change in the shape.
We can change back to circle shape again by clicking on the Circle icon.
"""Now, let's take a closer look at the circle shape on our canvas."""
"""Notice 2 resize handles and 2 circular handles called arc handles, on the shape."""
The 2 resize handles can be used to alter the shape of the circle to an ellipse shape.
Just drag these handles in the up-down or left-right directions.
Observe the changes in the shape.
The 2 arc handles overlap each other. Click on the arc handle and move it anti-clockwise.
We can now see both the arc handles.
We can modify the circle shape into arc or segment shape using these arc handles.
Just by moving them in clockwise or anti-clockwise directions and observe the change in the shape.
"""Now, we will click on the rectangle tool in the Tool box and then click on the square."""
Notice 2 resize handles and 2 arc handles on the top right corner of the shape.
"""As before, the 2 arc handles overlap each other."""
Click on one of the arc handle and move it clockwise.
"""Now, we can see both the arc handles."""
We can give rounded edges to the square using these handles.
Move them in clockwise or anti-clockwise directions and observe the change in the shape.
"""Now, let us create a polygon by clicking on the Stars and polygons tool from the Tool box."""
"""This is right below the circle tool. So, click on it."""
We will draw a polygon in a similar way and change the color to green.
"""By default, a 5-sided polygon i.e. a pentagon is drawn."""
"""Look at the Tool controls bar. Here, it says the number of corners of the polygon is 5."""
You can create a square by decreasing the number to 4 and a triangle by decreasing it to 3.
"""By increasing it, we can create a pentagon, hexagon and so on."""
Notice a resize handle on the polygon.
We can use it to resize or rotate the polygon.
"""Convert this shape into a star shape by clicking on the star icon next to the polygon icon, in the Tool controls bar."""
Notice 2 handles on the star shape – one at the tip and one at the joint.
Click and drag the handle at the tip of the star to resize or rotate it.
We can resize and skew the shape of the star using the other handle.
Click on it and move in clockwise or anti-clockwise directions and observe the change in the shape and size.
We have come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about Inkscape interface."""
"""We also learnt to-  Create basic shapes like rectangle, square, circle, ellipse, polygon and star."""
Fill color into the shapes and  modify the shapes using handles.
Here is an assignment for you.
"Create  a rectangle shape filled with blue color, a circle shape with red color, a star with 7 sides in green color."
Your completed assignment should look like this.

We have come to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installation of FrontAccounting on Linux Operating System.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to - Install XAMPP"""
Download FrontAccounting software
Do the database setup and Install FrontAccounting in Linux OS
"""To record this tutorial, I‘m using: Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04"""
"""Apache, MySQL and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.5.19"""
FrontAccounting 2.4.7
Firefox web browser and  A working Internet connection.
You can use any web browser of your choice.
FrontAccounting is a server based Accounting System.
So we will be using XAMPP to setup the web server on our machine.
"""Open a web browser. In the address bar, type this URL and press Enter."""
This will take us to the XAMPP download page.
Here XAMPP is available to download for all operating systems.
The latest version of XAMPP can be downloaded by clicking this green button.
"""However, depending upon your software requirement, you may need a different version of XAMPP."""
In my case I need XAMPP version 5.5.19
Scroll down and select XAMPP Linux.
The redirected page will display all the XAMPP versions till date.
"""For this installation, I will select the XAMPP version 5.5.19"""
"""My system is a 64bit Operating System. So I will download, xampp-linux-x64-5.5.19-0-installer.run"""
"""Now, click on the Save file button and then click on the OK button."""
"""In my machine, it has been saved in the Downloads folder."""
Let’s open a terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T keys together.
"""On the terminal, type the command cd space Downloads and press Enter."""
This will change the current working directory to Downloads.
Then type the command as shown and press Enter.
"""Now to run the installer file, type the command as shown and press Enter. Enter the admin password if prompted."""
Now the Setup wizard dialog box opens.
Click on the Next button whenever prompted and follow the installation steps as shown.
Uncheck Learn more about Bitnami for XAMPP check box. Then continue by clicking on the Next button.
"""Once the installation done, uncheck Launch XAMPP check box."""
"""Lastly, click on Finish button."""
Now we should check whether XAMPP is successfully installed on our machine or not.
"""In the terminal, start XAMPP service by typing sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash lampp space start"""
Type the admin password when prompted and press Enter.
You may get a message as shown here. This indicates that XAMPP is installed on your system and you have started the service.
"""In case you get a message saying, Command not found, then XAMPP is not installed on your machine."""
You may get some error messages like: “Apache shutdown unexpectedly”  or
“Port 80 in use for Apache Server” or
“Unable to connect to any of the specified MySQL hosts for MySQL database.”
This is because the default ports allotted to Apache and MySQL is taken by another software.
Default port number for Apache is 80 and for MySQL is 3306.
"""To change these ports, refer to the Additional Reading Material of this tutorial."""
And allot the proper port numbers before proceeding further. For eg: 8080
"""Now, open Firefox web browser. In the address bar, type localhost and press Enter."""
We should be able to see the XAMPP screen.
"""If prompted for language selection, select English."""
We are now in the XAMPP homepage.
"""In the menu at the left of the screen, click on PHPinfo."""
Now press Ctrl + F keys and search for DOCUMENT underscore ROOT.
It will be found in the table Apache Environment.
The value of DOCUMENT underscore ROOT will be either slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs or  slash var slash www
"""In my machine, it is slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs."""
Please make a note of this path. We are going to install FrontAccounting here.
Let's start downloading Front Accounting.
Open another tab in the web browser and go to this URL.
Click on frontaccounting-2.4.7.tar.gz
"""Immediately, the download begins. Click on the Save File button and then click on the OK button."""
Switch back to the terminal.
"""Next, we have to extract the contents of the tar.gz file that we downloaded."""
"""So, type sudo space tar space hyphen zxvf space frontaccounting hyphen 2.4.7.tar.gz"""
Type the admin password if prompted and press Enter.
"""Once extracted, I will rename the extracted FrontAccounting folder as account."""
Type the command- mv space frontaccounting space account and press Enter.
"""Renaming of the folder name is optional, however, It helps to identify multiple instances of FrontAccounting installed on a single machine."""
Switch Back to the terminal.
Now we have to move the folder account into apache home directory.
"""To move account folder to apache home directory, type sudo space mv space account space /opt/lampp/htdocs/  and press Enter."""
"""Now, let’s go to the apache home directory."""
"""To do that, type cd space /opt/lampp/htdocs/  and press Enter."""
"""To change account folder permission, type sudo space chmod space -R space 777 space account slash  and press Enter."""
We have successfully installed the XAMPP server.
Make sure that the FrontAccounting installer is in the web server’s root directory.
Next we need to create a database for FrontAccounting to proceed further.
"""We will do this in phpmyadmin, which is the graphical user interface for MySQL It comes along with the XAMPP installation"""
"""Let us go back to the XAMPP Page in the browser. On the XAMPP page, in the menu at the left, click on phpMyadmin."""
Click on Users in the top menu and then click on Add User.
In the new window that opens enter a username of your choice. I will type frontacc as my username.
"""From the Host drop-down list, select Local."""
Enter a password of your choice in the Password text-box.
I will type admin123 as my password.
Type the same password in the Re-type textbox.
Do not click on Generate Password prompt for now.
"""Under Database for user, we can see the option Create database with the same name and grant all privileges."""
We will check that option and scroll down.
Then click the Go button at the bottom right of the page.
We see a message “You have added a new user”. It means a new database with the name frontacc and with a user frontacc has been created.
This username and password is only for Database login purpose.
"""Make a note of the username, password and database names."""
These will be required later to complete the FrontAccounting installation.
Please note:  Database name and username need not be the same.
"""To have different names, create the database first and then create a user for that database."""
"""Also, as per naming convention, username should not have any spaces in between."""
We now have XAMPP running and our database is ready.
We are now ready to proceed installing Front Accounting.
In the web browser open a new tab. In the address bar type localhost/account and press Enter.
We can see the FrontAccounting webpage showing Step 1: System Diagnostics
Make sure that Select install wizard language is English.
Scroll down and click on Continue button at the bottom of the page.
The title of the next web page is Step 2: Database Server Settings.
"""Here, I’ll keep the server port as empty."""
"""If you have changed the MySQL default port number other than 3306, then enter that port number here."""
Enter the following details which we have created earlier- database Name as frontacc database user as frontacc
database password as admin123
Ignore the rest of options and click on Continue button at the bottom.
"""Next, you will need to put the details of your own company. I will demonstrate how to do so."""
"""In Company Name field, I will type ST Company Pvt Ltd."""
I will keep the Admin Login as admin.
Then I will type the Admin password as spoken. You can give any password of your choice.
Re-enter the same password. Remember this is the login password.
Next we see two options for the Charts of Accounts.
I will select Standard new company American COA.
Select the Default Language as English.
Click on the Install button.
"""We can see the final message on our screen, FrontAccounting ERP has been installed successfully. Which confirms that our installation is successful."""
"""Click on the link, Click here to start to log-in to the FrontAccounting interface."""
"""In the log-in screen, enter the following details: User name as admin Password as spoken"""
Company as ST Company Pvt. Ltd. And click on the Login button.
We are brought to the Front Accounting Administration page. We can see various tabs on this page.
We will learn how to use many of these later in this series.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to -   Download and install XAMPP"""
Download and install FrontAccounting software
And Do the database setup in Linux OS

Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Simple Filters with Linux.
"""Here we will be learning about head, Tail, sort, cut and paste."""
All these are command line text manipulation tools.
"""If you see a hash (#) symbol on the Terminal, you need to become root to execute those commands."""
"""sudo su or su root. If you see a dollar symbol on the Terminal, you can be an ordinary user to execute those commands."""
I assume that you did a default installation and did not modify any path where the files are getting saved.
I am using Linux for this tutorial.
"""Prerequisites for this module are- the ability to use the mouse, keyboard, maximize and minimize buttons on a window."""
"""We use the Head command followed by an ascii file name to display the first 10 lines of a file, by default."""
Let us create a file.
Go to Applications > Accessories > Text Editor.
I already have these numbers in another file for the sake of time constraint.
Let me copy and paste.
"""Hit on File, Save."""
Name the file as numbers dot txt and hit on Save.
Close this file.
"""Now, go to Applications > Accessories > Terminal."""
Let us try to see if we can see the file we created.
Type ls and hit on Enter.
What we did here is to list all the folders and files on our home directory.
Now we can use the cat command to read the contents of the file we created.
Cat n-u-m. Hit on tab to auto-fill the file name. Hit on Enter.
Let us do the same with the head command.
head numbers dot txt Enter.
Now the first 10 lines are displayed.
"""If we want to see the first 5 lines, use the option  hyphen n5 in between the head command and the file name."""
"""Hit on Up-arrow,  hyphen n5 and Enter."""
"""Now, the first 5 lines alone are displayed."""
Let us switch back to the presentation.
"""The tail command works exactly opposite to the head command, it displays the last 10 lines of a file, by default."""
I am hitting on ALT and Tab to switch to the terminal.
tail numbers dot txt
"""If we want to see just the last 5 lines, use the option hyphen n5 in between the tail command and the file name."""
"""hyphen n5, Enter."""
Switch to slides.
A log file contains events which took place in a system.
Auth dot log file maintains log's for who logged in & who logged out.
The most useful option of the tail command is to use hyphen f option to follow the tail of a log file.
"""If a new line is appended to the log file, the tail command will take that as the last line and display 10 lines, by default, above it."""
Go to the terminal.
tail hyphen f forward slash var slash log slash auth dot log.
Let me resize this terminal.
"""Let us open another Terminal, Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal."""
Let me resize this terminal
so that I can show you in a single screen how tail follows the last line in a log file.
"""Try to su as yourself, hit on Enter."""
Give in some wrong password and hit on Enter.
You will see that the terminal on which tail is running is appended with a new log.
The date & time specify when the authentication failure took place.
"""Type: date, hit on Enter to verify the system date and time."""
Type Exit to close this terminal.
Hit CTRL C to close the running tail command & maximize the screen.
We have seen only auth dot log file in the previous example.
These are the commonly used log files in Linux.
A Linux system administrator will look into these log files for more information to troubleshoot his machine if there is a problem.
"""""""Sort"""" command, as the name suggests, will sort a file for us in both ascending and descending order."""
sort numbers dot txt. This would sort our numbers dot txt file in ascending order.
"""Notice something is strange in there, sort just looks at the first character to sort, so 10, 11 & 12 appear before the number 2."""
"""To avoid this, add the option of -n hyphen n and  Enter."""
"""Now, sort looks at the entire number to sort them."""
"""To sort numbers dot txt in reverse order, add an option of hyphen r."""
"""We have numbers that repeat in this file. To pull out just the unique numbers, add another option of hyphen u."""
Go to Terminal.
Up-Arrow.
"""U,  Enter."""
"""Previously, two 2's were displayed. Now only one 2 is displayed."""
"""Now, we will see how we can sort a file based on certain column."""
Let us create a file and key in these as shown below.
Go to Applications > Accessories > Text Editor.
"""I already have the data in another file for the sake of time constraint. Let me copy & Paste the value, CTRL+C; CTRL+V."""
"""File, Save it as marks dot txt, Hit on Save."""
Don't mind the special characters on this file. I don't want someone to sue me for giving them low marks.
Close this file.
Let us sort based on the second column of marks dot txt file.
sort space marks dot txt space hyphen t space open inverted commas space close inverted commas space.
"""Here, hyphen t stands for the delimiter & the space in between the quotes represents it."""
hyphen k2 for the second column on which sort should be performed.
Hit on Enter.
Cat marks dot txt.
"""This is the original file, if you see Avir is moved above and Bala came below when we sorted based on the second column alone."""
Cut command is used to cut just certain information from a file.
Let us pull out the names from marks dot txt.
Let us go to the terminal ALT Tab.
cut space marks dot txt space hyphen d space open inverted commas  space close inverted commas space.
"""Here in cut command, 'd' is the delimiter & the space in between the quotes represents the delimiter."""
hyphen f2 for the second column. Hit on Enter.
Paste command will merge corresponding subsequent lines of the files.
"""Let us use both,  numbers dot txt and marks dot txt files now."""
"""paste numbers dot txt  marks dot txt, Enter."""
"""Now, the first line of marks dot txt was appended to the first line of numbers dot txt."""
We can use the redirect key to redirect this output to some other file called concatefile dot txt.
Hit on Up-arrow. Hit on the redirect key which is the Greater-than symbol. concatfile dot txt. Hit on Enter.
Cat concatfile dot txt.
Let us go to the slide.
"""If we want paste to print out the numbers serially, delimited with tab, we can use the hyphen s option."""
paste  hyphen s
numbers dot txt

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on conversion of Excel data to Marc 21 format.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to convert Excel data to Marc 21 format on a 64-bit Windows machine."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Windows 10 Pro and Firefox web browser."""
"""To follow this tutorial, learners should be familiar with Library Science."""
"""Before moving ahead, please ensure that you have the following on your machine- Windows 10, 8 or 7,"""
"""Any web browser. For eg: Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome."""
"""Earlier in the same series, we had installed MarcEdit 7 on the Desktop."""
Open the same MarcEdit 7 by double-clicking on the icon.
A window named MarcEdit 7.0.250 By Terry Reese opens.
Locate and click on the tab Export Tab Delimited Text.
"""Under the Source File field, locate the icon for a folder."""
The source file is an Excel file which we are converting into .mrk format.
Click on this icon for the Folder and browse for the Excel file in the field for File name.
Click on the drop-down adjacent to File name.
If you have Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP/2003 (.xls) then choose the format Excel File(*.xls).
"""And if you have, Microsoft Excel 2007/2010/2013 XML(.xlsx) then choose the format Excel File(*.xlsx)."""
"""As I have the .(dot)xlsx  file, I will select Excel XML File(*.xlsx)."""
"""Next, go to the left-side folders and select the folder where your Excel file is saved."""
I have selected Downloads because that’s where I saved my Excel file.
"""So, from the Downloads folder, I have selected TestData.xlsx."""
"""When the file TestData.xlsx is selected, it appears in the File name field."""
"""Now, click on the Open button at the bottom of the window."""
The same window re-opens with the Source File as  C:\Users\spoken\Downloads\TestData.xlsx.
"""Now, click on the folder icon adjacent to the Output File."""
"""On doing so, Save File window opens prompting us to fill in the File name."""
"""On the same window, I will click on the Downloads folder located at the left hand side. And, type the File name: as TestData."""
Now click on Save button at the bottom of the page.
The same window appears again. The Output file field shows: C:\Users\spoken\Downloads\TestData.mrk.
"""Note that Excel Sheet Name: Sheet1 gets selected automatically by MarcEdit 7. However, this sheet name is editable."""
"""Under the Section Options, the check-box UTF-8 Encoded is selected by MarcEdit 7, by default."""
Click on the Next button at the right side of the same window.
"""Again a new window, MarcEdit Delimited Text Translator opens. The heading says Data Snapshot."""
This window will have all the field details as per entries made in the Excel file.
We will see the Fields ranging from 0 to 8 and above with their corresponding values.
"""For example, Field 0 has a value of 978-3-319-47238-6 (ISBN) on my machine."""
You may see a different value as per your Excel sheet.
"""Under the section DataSnapshot, locate the section Settings."""
Go to the tab Select and from the drop-down select Field 0.
With this we will be doing the mapping of Excel data with Koha MARC Tags.
"""Remember, you can customize Map To: and Indicators."""
"""However, it is important that the Fields and Subfield Codes are as per the Koha MARC Tag."""
"""For more information on MARC Tags, visit the link of official Library of Congress site."""
"""On the browser, type this URL and click on search."""
Recall that Map To: values entered in the field are referred from an earlier tutorial in this series.
I will enter 020$a in the Map To: field.
This sequence will change as per your Excel data.
I will leave Indicators: and Term. Punctuation: as they are.
"""However, you may fill these fields as directed by the Koha MARC Tags."""
Next is the check-box for Constant Data.
"""Click this if you wish to map the same information  into the data field for each entry, in the delimited text document."""
Click Repeatable subfield if you want to repeat the same subfield.
"""Next, click on the button Add Argument."""
"""On doing so, the value 0 020$a 0 appears in the field under the section Arguments."""
"""Similarly, let’s map all the other fields."""
"""Under the section Settings, go to Select. From the drop- down, select Field 1."""
"""In the field for Map To, type:  080$a."""
"""Now, click on the button Add Argument."""
"""On doing so, the value 1 080$a 0 appears in the field under the section Arguments."""
"""Under the tab Select, from the drop-down, select Field 2."""
"""In the field for Map To, type: 100$a."""
"""In the field for Indicators, type 1."""
Note that 1 is the first indicator of tag 100 and it represents the Surname for the subfield ‘a’.
"""Likewise, complete the mapping of all the fields up to Field 13 as being shown in the drop-down under Select."""
Notice the up and down arrows adjacent to each field.
You may use these to change the sequence of the values that appear.
"""Under the section Arguments, the Tags that are common with different sub-fields need to be joined."""
"""For that, do the following- Select common tags for example 245$a and 245$c."""
Then right-click on common tags and from drop-down select Join Items.
This will create a grouping of the fields that are with the same type.
Note that the * (asterisk symbol) will appear before the selected Tags.
The * asterisk symbol indicates that the common tags are now joined.
"""Alternately, you can do the mapping of fields by clicking on the tab Auto Generate to import the values of respective fields from 0 to 13, in the fields provided for Arguments."""
"""However, I have done mapping manually. So, I will not click Auto Generate option."""
Next we see four options.
First one is Save Template.
Use this if you want to save the same mapping for future use.
The saved template will be used if in case you face any problem with data conversion.
"""If we choose the option Save Template, then we will be prompted to give it a name and  specify the directory for saving it."""
It will get saved as .mrd file
Access this template in the future by clicking “Load Template” at the right side of the window.
Second option is Sort Fields.
Third option is Calculate common nonfiling data.
Fourth option is Ignore Header Row.
"""Click here, if you have a header in the Excel sheet and if you need to ignore the headings."""
"""Among these, Sort Fields and Calculate common nonfiling data are auto-selected by MarcEdit 7."""
I will leave them as they are.
"""Now, I will check the check-box for Save Template and Ignore Header Row."""
"""Next, locate and click on the tab Finish on the top right corner of the page."""
"""On doing so, Save File window opens, prompting us to fill in the File name."""
"""On the same window, I will click on the Downloads folder, located at the left hand side."""
"""And, in the field for File name, I will type TestData."""
"""Now, click on Save button at the bottom of the page."""
A pop-up window with the message: Process has been finished. Records saved to: C:\Users\Spoken\Download\TestData.mrk opens.
Click on the Ok button at the bottom of this dialog-box.
"""With this, .mrk file has been successfully saved in the directed location which is the Downloads folder."""
"""A new page MarcEdit 7.0.250 By Terry Reese, opens. Locate and click on the icon MarcEditor."""
"""A new page MarcEditor opens. On the main Menu, click on File and from the drop- down select Open."""
A window Open File opens showing TestData.mrk file.
Click and select the TestData.mrk file.
It will show in the field for File name.
Now click on Open at the bottom of the window.
Another window MarcEditor: TestData.mrk opens with all the details.
"""On the same window, from the main menu, click on the File."""
"""Now, from the drop-down select Compile File into MARC."""
Another new window Save File opens.
"""Here, locate File Name: and type the appropriate name in the field."""
I will type TestData.
"""Koha, by default, selects MARC Files (*.mrc) in the field Save as type:."""
"""Now, click on the Save button located at the bottom of the window."""
"""Upon doing so, on the same window at the bottom, you will see 5 records processed in 0.166228 seconds."""
This is because I imported only 5 records. You will see a different number of records and processed time as per your data.
"""With this, we have converted Excel data of our library into Marc 21 format successfully."""
Marc 21 format is the standard format used in Koha for cataloging and importing data into Koha.
"""Now, close this window. To do so, go to the top right corner and click on the Close button."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to- convert Excel data to Marc 21 format on a 64-bit Windows machine."""
Assignment: Prepare a list of 10 records in Excel and convert those records into MARC by using MarcEdit 7.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on How to create a Library in Koha.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to: create a library and create a Group."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux Operating System 16.04"""
and  Koha version 16.05.
"""To follow this tutorial, learners should have knowledge of Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have Koha installed on your system."""
"""And, you should also have Admin access in Koha."""
"""For more details, please refer to the Koha Spoken Tutorial series on this website."""
Let us begin. I have already installed Koha on my system.
Let me switch to the Koha interface.
Log into Koha using the username and password given at the time of installation.
"""On my system, I had given Username as koha underscore library."""
"""Now, type the Password that was noted down from the conf.xml file."""
The Koha main page opens.
"""Note that while setting up Koha-,  We should add the details of every Branch library that we will create in Koha."""
This data is used in several areas of Koha later.
"""Now, let’s add a new library."""
Switch back to Koha interface.
Go to Home and click on Koha Administration.
Locate the section Basic parameters.
Click on Libraries and groups.
"""To add a new library, click on the tab '+ New Library'."""
"""We will skip the groups section, for now."""
"""In this page, note that all the fields marked in red are mandatory."""
"""Fill in the fields Library code and Name for your library, as I have done here."""
Some important things to note are-  there should be no space in the Library code
"""And, it should be less than 10 characters long."""
This code will be used as a unique identifier in the database.
"""The next section is where we have to fill our library’s contact details like- Address, phone number etc."""
I have filled the details as shown here.
"""If you don’t have information for any field listed here, then just leave it blank."""
"""Likewise, fill in your library’s details on this page."""
The address and phone details can be used to make custom notices for your library later.
These details can also be used by members when they want to contact the library.
"""The Email id field is not mandatory, as you can see."""
"""However, it is extremely important to have an email id for the library you create."""
This is the email id from where the notices to the members go to and come from.
Gmail id is preferable as it can be easily configured for sending mail and/or receiving mail.
"""Below the Email id field, we have the Reply-To and Return-Path fields."""
"""Reply-To- if you would like to specify another default email address for all replies to notices, you can do that here."""
I will add Reply-To email id as stlibreoffice@gmail.com.
"""If this is left blank, then all replies will go to the Email id given above."""
Coming to Return-Path-  this is the email address that all bounced messages will go to.
"""If this is left blank, then all bounced messages will go to the Email id given above."""
"""So, basically three different email ids can be used for"""
"""Email id ,"""
Reply-To and
Return-Path.
"""However, if only one email id is provided then by default, Koha will use it for all the three fields."""
"""Next, mention the URL of your library in the field, like I have done here."""
"""On filling the URL field, the particular library name will be linked in the holdings table on the OPAC."""
"""After this, we have to fill in the OPAC info."""
This is where you have to put information about your library.
I have entered some information about my library here.
"""This info will appear in the OPAC, when we move the cursor over the library name in the holdings table."""
If the URL for a particular branch library is put in this field  then OPAC will tell us the branch library where the book is available.
"""To get the hyper-link address information, hover the mouse on the link."""
This will give the address of the particular branch library where the book can be issued from.
Let’s switch back to the Koha interface.
Next we have the IP address.
If you want to restrict Koha admin access to a particular IP address then you can specify the IP here.
"""Else, you can leave it blank."""
I will leave it blank.
"""Lastly, we have the Notes field."""
This is where you can fill in any notes for future reference.
These will not be displayed in OPAC.
"""After entering all the details, click on the Submit button."""
The name of the newly added library appears on the Libraries page.
"""In our case, Spoken Tutorial Library."""
Let us now see when to use the Group Library option.
"""If you want to add a new group, click on the tab '+ New Group'."""
"""Suppose you have a few branch libraries for e.g.-  Chemistry Library, Physics Library and  Biology Library and you want to group them."""
In such a scenario use the Group Library option.
Name this group as Science library which falls under the main library.
Grouping can be done on the basis of similarities and/or similar characteristics etc.
Logout from your current session as a Database administrative user.
"""To do so, go to the top right corner and click on No Library Set."""
"""From the drop-down, click on Logout."""
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to- create a library and   create a new Group."""
As an assignment-  create a new library and  create a new group .

Importing records into Koha is done in two steps: Stage MARC records for import and  Manage staged records.
"""To begin, let’s login to Koha with our Superlibrarian access."""
"""On the Home page, click on Tools."""
"""A new page opens. Under the section Catalog, click on Stage MARC records for import."""
A new page opens with the title Stage MARC records for import.
Go to the section Stage records into the reservoir.
"""Here, click on Browse... adjacent to Select the file to stage."""
A window File Upload opens. Then go to the Downloads folder.
"""Here, locate the file named TestData.mrc."""
"""Recall, we had created TestData.mrc file in one of the earlier tutorial."""
"""Select the TestData.mrc file, if not already selected. And, click on the button Open at the bottom of the page."""
"""On the same page, you will see TestData.mrc as name of the file, adjacent to the tab Browse."""
"""Now, click on Upload file button at the bottom of the page."""
You will see the Upload progress bar in brown color.
"""After the upload is complete up to 100%, we are prompted to fill in some details."""
"""First, fill the field for Comments about this file."""
This is useful for identifying the uploaded file in KOHA.
I will enter Book Data.
"""Next is Record type.  Here, Koha by default, selects Bibliographic."""
"""Similarly, for Character encoding, Koha by default selects UTF-8 (Default)."""
"""Next, come to the section Look for existing records in catalog?"""
"""Under this section, go to Record matching rule:  Koha by default, selects Do not look for matching records."""
"""If you want to match existing records, select another option from the drop down i.e. ISBN/ISSN number."""
Now we come to Action if matching record found.
"""Koha by default, selects Replace existing record with incoming record."""
"""Then comes Action if no match is found. Koha by default, selects Add incoming record."""
"""Next, we come to the section Check for embedded item record data? There are two options here,  Yes and  No."""
"""Koha by default, selects Yes."""
"""For How to process items, Koha by default, selects Always add items."""
"""There are other options, as well. You may choose any of these options as per your preference."""
Click on the Stage for import button at the bottom of the page. You will see “Job progress” in a blue colored bar.
"""When the progress is complete up to 100%, a new page opens with the heading Stage MARC records for import."""
Note that now we have successfully imported the data which we had in our Excel sheet.
It has the following details.
Note that you will see a different value on your Koha interface as per your .mrc data.
"""On this same page, above the title, you will see two options: Stage MARC records and Manage staged records."""
Note that I will not click on Stage MARC records as I have already imported the Excel file i.e. TestData.
If you need to import any other file then click on Stage MARC records and follow the steps as mentioned earlier.
"""Next, we have to manage the imported records in KOHA Catalog. So, click on Manage staged records."""
A new window Manage staged MARC records › Batch 6 opens.
"""On this page, Koha fills the following fields with the values shown here."""
"""And for the following fields, Koha by default, selects these entries from the drop down."""
"""But, you can change these entries from their respective drop-downs as per your requirement."""
Next is the button named Apply different matching rules.
You may click on this button to avoid the duplication of the records in the database. I will skip this button and move ahead.
"""Now, locate Add new bibliographic records into this framework. And from the drop down, I will select BOOKS."""
"""Again, you may select as per your requirement."""
"""Now, I will click on the tab Import this batch into the catalog ."""
"""However, before clicking we will go through the section Citation."""
Please note the particular numbers. Note that you will see a different number with the details that we have imported from Excel.
"""Now, we will click on the button named Import this batch into the catalog."""
"""When we do so, the Job progress bar appears."""
"""When the progress is complete up to 100%, a new page opens"""
with the heading Manage staged MARC records › Batch 6 and the following details which were entered earlier.
"""It is possible to undo your import. In case, you found a mistake in the imported data, to correct it do the following."""
Click on the tab Undo import into catalog at the bottom of the section.
I will not click here.
Next is Completed import of records.
"""Here, you will see the details of the records added, updated and so on."""
Then you will see the section Citation with the details that have been imported.
"""Once the import is complete, a link to the new Record will appear."""
This is visible to the right side of each Citation that was imported.
"""Now, we will confirm whether the titles are added in the Catalog or not."""
"""To do so, at the top of the same page, locate the field for Search the catalog."""
I will now do a small test to confirm the imports of records into Koha.
"""So, I will type one of the titles from the imported record in the Citation section."""
"""Then, click on the Submit button at the right side of the field."""
"""A new page opens- Inorganic chemistry Housecroft, Catherine E."""
"""Koha shows the searched Title result, which proves that records are imported properly."""
"""With this, we have completed importing MARC into Koha."""
"""Let us Summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt to import a MARC file into KOHA and  search imported data in OPAC."""
For assignment- Use the 10 records of MARC that were converted in an earlier tutorial and import them into KOHA.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Basics of Bezier tool using Inkscape.
Draw straight lines and closed shapes
Draw curved lines
"""Add, edit and delete nodes."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:"""
I will be recording this tutorial in maximum resolution mode.
This is to accommodate all the tools that will be demonstrated.
Let us open Inkscape.
First let us draw a straight line using Bezier tool.
The Bezier tool is right below the Pencil tool.
Let's click on it.
Observe the 4 options in the Tool controls bar at the top left.
There are 4 modes of drawing Bezier curve.
"""By default, the Create regular Bezier path option is enabled."""
Click once on the canvas and move the cursor to the other end.
Click once again. Notice that the line drawn is highlighted in green color.
"""Now, right-click to complete the line."""
The two end points of the line are called nodes. We will learn more about them a little later.
"""Next, let us draw a triangle."""
"""First, draw a slanted line. Click once and draw another line at an angle."""
Now click once more to draw a third line and join it with the starting node to complete the triangle.
"""Next, we will draw a curved line using Bezier tool."""
"""Click on the canvas to draw a straight line. Click again, hold and drag to form a curve."""
Right-click to complete the curve.
"""In a similar way, draw some more curve shapes on the canvas."""
Remember these steps- 1. Click and draw a straight line.
"""2. Click again, hold and drag to form a curve."""
3.  Then right-click to complete the curve.
Press Ctrl + A and clear the canvas before proceeding further.
"""Next, let us learn how to draw a closed curved path."""
First draw a curved line on the canvas.
Then we release the mouse and move the cursor away from the end node of the curved line.
We see a curved path in red color.
"""If you click once and move the cursor, we see a straight path in red color. To make it as a curve, click and drag."""
"""Again at the end node, the line curves as we move."""
"""Again click once; we see a straight path in red color. To make the straight line curved, click and drag."""
"""Again at the end node, the line curves as we move. Move the cursor and go back to the starting node and close the path."""
Go to Tool controls bar. Click on the second icon of the mode. This helps to create spiral paths and irregular shapes.
Draw some irregular curves and close the path.
Observe that it transforms into the closest spiral shape. Let me clear the canvas now.
The third icon creates only straight lines. Click on it and draw lines on the canvas.
"""Note, we cannot draw curved lines in this mode."""
We can draw triangles or polygons which have straight sides.
Click on the last icon and draw on the canvas.
"""In this mode, we can draw only parallel and perpendicular lines i.e. either vertical or horizontal lines."""
"""So, we can draw squares and rectangles in this mode."""
Let me delete all the shapes drawn.
Shape option helps to draw lines or curves in a particular shape.
Click on the drop-down button.
"""There are 5 options here- None, Triangle in, Triangle out, Ellipse, From clipboard."""
"""The first option that is None does not give any effect. So, we will move on to Triangle in."""
Click on it and draw a line on the canvas.
The line is transformed to a triangle shape inwards.
"""Next, click on Triangle out and draw a line on the canvas."""
Now a triangle shape is formed outwards.
Click on the Ellipse and draw a line.
Observe that the line is in ellipse shape.
We will learn about the last option that is From clipboard in later tutorial.
"""Now, let us learn how to add, edit and delete nodes."""
This can be done using the Node tool.
Delete the lines on the canvas.
Go to Tool controls bar. Change the Mode to regular path and Shape to None.
Come back to the canvas and draw a rough human palm.
"""Now, click on the Node tool."""
Notice all the nodes in this figure are visible.
Turn your attention to the Tool Controls bar.
"""The first 6 icons here, help to add and delete nodes and paths."""
Refer to the tool tip to understand better.
Click on any segment. Notice both the nodes turn blue.
Then click on the Add node option.
Observe that a new node has been added exactly in-between the nodes of the selected segment.
"""Now, select a smaller segment and repeat the above steps."""
You will see that a new node is added at the mid-point of the smaller segment.
"""Now, select the newly added node."""
Click on the Delete node option. The node is now deleted.
Click on any one of the nodes on the palm.
"""To make the Bezier handle visible, click on the last but one icon on the Tool controls bar."""
"""Now, the Bezier handles for the selected segment is visible."""
"""If not, then just click on the segment and without releasing the mouse, move it a little."""
The segment will curve and the Bezier handles will be visible now.
Click on the handles to resize and rotate the selected node.
"""In a similar way, modify the other nodes too."""
The next icon helps to join nodes.
"""Observe, there is an extra node on the index finger."""
Select the extra middle node and the top node by using the Shift key.
"""Now, click on Join node icon. Observe that the nodes are now joined together."""
The next icon helps to break path at selected nodes.
Let me now break the connection between the thumb and the index finger.
"""So, select the joining node in between and click on Break path icon."""
Un-select the node. Then select it again and move it a little.
You will notice that the path is broken and the nodes are separated into 2 distinct nodes.
"""To join them, select the same 2 nodes and click on the Join selected end-nodes icon on the Tool controls bar."""
"""Notice, a new path is created between these 2 nodes."""
Click on the next icon i.e. Delete segment icon to remove the path or segment. Now the path is removed.
Press Ctrl + Z to undo this action.
Let me keep this hand aside. Click on the Node tool once again.
Let us learn how to use next 4 icons on the Tool controls bar.
These icons help to edit the selected nodes.
"""Using the Bezier tool ,draw an inverted U shape. Click on the Node tool. Observe there are 3 nodes."""
Select the top node and click on Make selected nodes corner icon on the Tool controls bar.
This makes it as the corner node.
Click on the Bezier handles and move them up and down to see the change.
Click on the next icon to make the node smooth. Observe the change in the shape.
Click on the next icon which makes the node symmetric.
Click on the next icon which makes the node auto smooth.
"""The next 2 icons work only on segments. So, select the left segment of the U shape and click on the first icon."""
"""As the tool tip says, the segment is now made into a straight line."""
Click on the Bezier handle and try to move. You will see that we cannot make it curved.
Click on the next icon to make it a curved line again.
"""Now, move the Bezier handles and  now we can make it into a curve shape."""
Click on the next icon to convert selected object to path.
Click on the next icon to convert the stroke to path.
Click and drag the nodes to make the strokes visible.
The next 2 icons help to move the selected nodes in X and Y directions respectively.
Click on the up and down arrows and observe the change.
The next 2 icons work only if the path has clipping and masking effects.
You can explore these options on your own.
"""Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt to:"""
Draw straight lines and closed shapes
Draw curved lines
"""Add, edit and delete nodes."""
Here is an assignment for you-
"""Draw a flower with 5 petals, 1 stem and 2 leaves using Bezier tool."""
Color the petals with pink color.
Color the stem and leaves with green color.
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Introduction to Mozilla Firefox.
"""In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:"""
What is Mozilla Firefox?
Why Firefox?
"""Versions, System Requirements, Download and Install Firefox, Visit a website."""
"""""""Mozilla Firefox"""" or simply """"Firefox"""" is a free, open source web browser."""
"""It is the default web browser for Ubuntu Linux, serving as a window to the Internet."""
It allows you to view the Internet web-pages and navigate through the web pages.
"""It also searches for web pages using search engines such as Google, Yahoo Search or Bing."""
"""Firefox has been developed by volunteer programmers at the Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization."""
Visit 'mozilla.org' for detailed information on Mozilla.
"""Firefox works on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux Operating Systems."""
"""Some examples of other popular web browsers for Ubuntu are 'Konqueror', 'Google Chrome' and 'Opera'."""
"""In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 for Ubuntu 10.04."""
"""Firefox makes browsing better by bringing together speed, privacy and latest technologies."""
"""It has a variety of features such as tabbed windows, built-in spell checking, pop-up blocker, integrated web search, Phishing protection."""
"""Firefox provides faster web browsing with rapid rendering of graphics, improved page loading."""
"""It also offers a variety of security and privacy options against fraudulent websites, spyware and viruses, trojans or other malware."""
And it offers customization by way of add-ons and thousands of easy-to-install themes created by users.
"""Here are the System Requirements to run Firefox on Linux OS such as -Fedora, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Debian and SUSE."""
You will need the following libraries or packages to run Firefox on Ubuntu 10.04.
GTK+ 2.10 or higher

libstdc++ 4.3 or higher
Pango 1.14 or higher
X.Org 1.7 or higher.
And the recommended hardware are Pentium 4 or above with 512MB of RAM and 200MB of hard drive space.
"""For complete information on System requirements, visit the Firefox website shown on the screen."""
Let us now download and install Mozilla Firefox by visiting the official website at 'mozilla.com' as shown on the screen.
"""Here, we can always find the latest version of Firefox."""
"""Or we can click on the all Systems and Languages link, below the green area, for more options."""
Notice that Mozilla offers Firefox in over 70 languages.
"""Here, we can download various localized versions such as Hindi or Bengali."""
"""We can also choose the operating system: Windows, Mac or Linux by clicking on the various icons."""
"""In Ubuntu Linux, first select the location to save the file. By default, the Downloads directory in your 'Home page' folder is selected."""
"""Now you can select the Save File option and click on the OK button, appearing in the pop-up window."""
"""This will save Firefox archive to the Downloads directory, under the Home directory."""
Open a 'Terminal' Window and go to your Downloads directory by typing the following command: cd ~/Downloads.
"""Now, press the Enter key."""
Extract the contents of the downloaded file by typing the following command: tar xjf firefox-7.0.1.tar.bz2
Now press the Enter key.
This will start extracting the files required to run Firefox 7.0.
"""In the Terminal Window, go to the Firefox directory by typing the following command: cd firefox"""
This will take you to the Firefox directory.
"""To launch the Firefox browser, type the following command: ./firefox and press the Enter key."""
"""Alternately, you can launch Firefox by using the following command when your current directory is not the home directory."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the awk command.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn 'awk' command."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Linux  Operating system GNU BASH 4.2.24"""
"""Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
Let us start with an introduction to awk.
The awk command is a very powerful text manipulation tool.
"""It is named after its authors, Aho, Weinberger and Kernighan."""
It can perform several functions.
It operates at the field level of a record.
"""So, it can easily access and edit the individual fields of the record."""
Let us see some examples.
"""For demonstration purpose, we use the awkdemo.txt file."""
Let us see the contents of awkdemo.txt file.
"""Now, open the terminal window."""
Let us see how to print using 'awk' command.
Type: awk space within single quote front-slash Pass  front- slash opening curly bracket print closing curly bracket (after the  quotes) space awkdemo.txt
press Enter.
"""Here, Pass is the selection criteria."""
All the lines of the awkdemo where Pass occurs are printed.
The action here is print.
We can also use regular expressions in awk.
"""Say, we want to print records of students with name Mira."""
We would type: awk space within single quotes front-slash capital M (/M) opening square-bracket  ei closing square-bracket asterisk-sign ra asterisk-sign front-slash space opening curly-bracket  print closing
(asterisk)  will give one or more occurrences of previous character.
"""Thus, entries with more than one occurrence for i, e and a will be listed."""
For example- Mira (with 'M'  'I'  'R'  'A')
Meera(with 'M'  'E'  'E'  'R'  'A')
Meeraa(with M E E R A A )
awk supports the extended regular expressions (ERE)
which means we can match multiple patterns separated by a PIPE.
Let me clear the prompt.
) electrical front slash space opening curly bracket print closing curly bracket after the quotes space awkdemo.txt
"""Press Enter."
"Now, entries for both civil and electrical are given."""
Let us go back to our slides.
Parameters: awk has some special parameters to identify individual fields of a line.
$1 (Dollar 1) would indicate the first field.
"""Similarly, we can have $2, $3 and so on for respective fields."""
$0 represents the entire line.
come back to our terminal.
Note that each word is separated by PIPE in the file awkdemo.txt.
"""In this case, PIPE is called a delimiter."""
A delimiter separates words from each other.
A delimiter can also be a single white space.
"""To specify a delimiter, we have to give '-F' (capital F) flag followed by a delimiter. Let us see."""
Type: awk space minus (capital) F space within double quotes  PIPE space within single quote front slash civil PIPE electrical front slash  opening curly bracket print space dollar0 closing curly bracket  aft
This prints the entire line since we have used $0.
Notice that names and stream of students are the second and third fields.
"""Say, we only want to print two fields."""
We will replace $0 with $2 and $3 in the above command.
Press Enter .
Only two fields are shown.
"""Though it gives the right result, the display is all jagged and un-formatted."""
We can provide formatted output by using the C style printf statement.
We can also provide a serial number by using a builtin variable NR.
We will see more about builtin variables later.
"""Now, type: awk space minus (capital) F within double quotes Pipe  after the double quotes space 'front slash Pass front slash opening curly-bracket printf  within double quotes  percentage-  sign 4d space pe"
We see the difference.
"""Here,  NR stands for number of records."""
"""Records are integers, hence we have written %d."""
Name and Stream are strings. So we have used %s.
"""Here, 25s will reserve 25 spaces for Name field."""
15s will reserve 15 spaces for Stream field.
The minus sign is used to left justify the output.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Let us move back to our slides.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt:  To print using awk"""
Regular expression in awk to list the entries for a particular stream
To list only the second and the third fields
"""To display a formatted output. As an assignment,"""
"""Display roll no., stream and marks of Ankti Saraf"""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Type Conversion in Java.
"""In this tutorial, we learn:"""
How to convert data from one data type to another.
"""The two types of conversion, namely implicit and explicit conversion and"""
How to convert strings to numbers.
"""For this tutorial we are using: Ubuntu v 11.10, JDK 1.6  and Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have  knowledge of data types in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown."""
Type conversion means converting data from one data type to another.
Let us see how it it done.
Switch to Eclipse.
Here we have the 'Eclipse IDE' and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
I have created a class TypeConversion and added the main method to it.
Now let us create a few variables.
int a  equal to 5; float b; b equal to a;
I have created two variables. a which is an integer and b which is a float.
I’m storing the integer value in a float variable.
Let us see what the float variable now contains.
System dot out dot  println(b);
Save the file and run it.
We can see that the integer 5 has been converted to float 5.0
This type of conversion is called implicit conversion.
"""As the name goes,  the value is automatically converted to suit the data type."""
"""Now let us convert float to an int, using the same method."""
"""Remove the 5,  float b equal to 2.5f  and let us store 'b' in 'a' and print the value of 'a'."""
we see that there is an error.
The error message  reads- Type mismatch: cannot convert from float to int.
It means Implicit conversion is possible only from an int to a float but not the the other way.
To convert a float to an  int we have to use explicit conversion.
Let us see how to do so.
"""We do that by using an int in parentheses, before the variable."""
This statement says the data in the variable 'b' has to be converted to int data type and stored in 'a'.
save and run the file.
"""As we can see, the float value has been converted to int."""
"""But to suit the data type, the data has been changed accordingly."""
Explicit conversion can also be used to convert data from int to float.
Let us try the previous example.
int a =5; float b; b = (float) a;
System.out.println(b);
We are using Explicit conversion to convert integer to a  float.
Save  the file and Run it.
we see that the int value has been converted to a float value.
Let us  see what happens when we convert a character to an integer.
int a; char c  equal to in single quotes m;
a equal to  (int) c;
System dot out dot println(a);
We are converting the character 'm' to an integer and printing the value.
Let us save and run it.
"""As we can see, the output is 109 which is the ascii value of 'm'."""
"""It means when a char is converted to int, its ascii value is stored."""
Let us try this with a digit.
char c = digit 5;
Save it and run it.
"""As we can see, the output is 53 which is the ascii value of the character ‘5’."""
It is not the number 5.
"""To get the number, we have to use a string and convert it to an integer."""
Now let us see how to do so.
Clean up the main function.
Type:
String sHeight meaning string form of Height equal to in double quotes 6
int h equal to explicit conversion  int of sHeight  and
System dot out dot  println(h) Save the file.
I’ve created a string variable with value 6 and I am trying to convert it to an integer but we see that there is an error
and the error message reads: Cannot cast from String to int.
"""This means, for converting strings, we cannot use implicit or explicit conversion."""
It must be done by other methods. let us use them.
Remove  int sHeight  and type  Integer dot parseInt sHeight;
we see that the value has been successfully converted to an integer.
"""To do this, we use the parseInt  method of the integer module."""
"""Now let us see what happens if there are more than one digits like """"6543"""""""
We see that again the string containing  the number has been successfully converted to an integer.
"""Now, let us see what happens if the string is a floating point number."""
"""Change """"6543"""" to """"65.43"""". So, we have a floating point number in a string and we are converting it to an integer."""
"""Save the file, run it."""
We see that there is an error. This happens because we cannot convert a   string  which contains floating point number into an integer.
We have to convert it to  a float. Let us see how to do so.
"""First, data type should be float,"""
second we will use Float. parseFloat.
We are using the parseFloat method of the float class to convert the string containing a floating point number into an actual floating point number.
"""Save the file, run it. We can  see that the string containing a floating point number  has been successfully converted  to a floating point number."""
And this is how we do implicit and explicit conversion and how we convert strings to numbers.
This brings us to  the end of the tutorial.
In this tutorial we have learnt: How to convert data from one type to another.
What is meant by implicit and  explicit conversion.
and How to convert strings to numbers.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial, read about the Integer.toString and Float.toString methods"""

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on built-in functions in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about different types of built-in functions like- Arithmetic functions,"""
"""String functions,"""
Input/Output functions and Time-stamp functions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:  Ubuntu Linux 16.04 operating system and gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the earlier awk tutorials on this website."""
You should have some knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
Built-in functions are always available for awk to call.
First we will learn about the arithmetic functions. square root function (sqrt (x)) returns positive square root of a number x.
int() function truncates x to an integer value.
exponential  function gives the exponential of x.
log function returns natural logarithm value of x.
sin and cos give sine(x) and cosine(x) respectively.
Please note that argument x should be mentioned in radians.
Let’s look at an example to understand these functions.
I have already written the code in a file arithmetic underscore function dot awk. The same is available in the Code Files link.
"""Here, we are printing the square root of a positive and negative number respectively."""
"""Next, we are printing the integer value for a positive and negative number respectively."""
Then we are printing exponential of a small number and a very large number.
"""After that, natural logarithm of positive and negative numbers are printed."""
"""We are also printing sine and cosine values of 0.52 radian, that is actually 30 degree. Let us execute the file in the terminal."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T Keys."""
"""Next, go to the folder where you have downloaded and extracted the file using cd command."""
"""Now, type: awk space -f space arithmetic_function.awk  and press Enter to see the output."""
Couple of things are clear from this output.
sqrt() function gives square root of a positive number.
It returns nan or not a number if the number is negative.
int() function gives the truncated integer of any positive or negative number.
"""exp() function gives exponential of a number. If the number is very large, the function will return inf."""
natural logarithm of positive number is given by log() function.
"""If the number is negative, the function returns nan."""
Sine and cosine functions return corresponding values. You can verify the values using your calculator.
"""Now, let us look at random functions."""
rand() function returns any random number between 0 and 1. But never returns 0 or 1.
Generated numbers will be random within one awk execution.
"""But, predictable across different executions of the awk program."""
srand(x) function is used to provide seed value x for random function.
"""In absence of x, date and time of day is used as the seed value. Let us understand these with an example."""
I have written a code for the random function and saved it as random.awk.
"""Here, inside the for loop, rand() function will generate a random number between 0 and 1."""
Then the generated number will be multiplied by 50 and get printed.
"""So, this code will generate 5 random numbers within 50."""
Switch to the terminal and execute the file. Let me clear the terminal.
Type: awk space hyphen f space random dot awk and press Enter.
"""See, it is giving 5 random numbers."""
What happens if I execute the code again?
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
"""We are getting the same output. Which means, awk is generating the same set of random numbers for every execution of the script."""
Then how can we get a new set of random numbers in every execution? Switch to the code once again.
"""Before the for loop, type srand() function."""
Press Ctrl and S keys to save the file.
"""Now, switch to the terminal."""
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
It is giving a different set of random numbers.
"""So, we can generate a new set of random numbers using srand function when it’s used without an argument."""
Next we will see some string functions. length() function gives the length of a particular string s.
index() function determines the position of string s2 within the larger string s1.
"""For example- index within parentheses within double quotes linux comma within double quotes n, returns 3. Let us see an example."""
Open the file awkdemo.txt
We know that each student in the awkdemo.txt file has a 4 digit roll number.
"""Due to typing error, the roll numbers may have wrong number of digits. We can easily detect these using awk commands."""
Switch to the terminal . Let me clear the terminal.
"""Now, type the command as shown here. Here we are checking the length of the 1st field is equal to 4 or not."""
"""If not, then that particular record will get printed. Press Enter."""
"""See, there is one roll-number S02 that has been typed incorrectly."""
"""It has three digits, whereas all others have four digits."""
"""The substr(s,a,b) function extracts a substring from a larger string s."""
Let me explain the parameters.
Here s is the string.
a denotes the position in s from which the extraction would start.
b denotes the number of characters that would be extracted. Let us see one example.
Switch to the awkdemo.txt file.
"""Here, the first letter of the roll numbers represents the Hostel code where the particular student resides."""
"""Say, we want to find the list of students who are staying in Hostel A."""
"""To get that, let’s switch to the terminal."""
Type the command as shown here.
"""Here, we take the string denoted by $1."""
"""As we know, $1 represents the first field that is roll number in our case."""
"""Next, we extract a substring that starts at position one with the character length one."""
"""Then, if it is equal to capital A then that line from the file will get printed. Press Enter to see the output."""
We got the list of students who are in Hostel A.
"""We have seen the function split() earlier. So, I am not explaining the details here."""
Please refer to the earlier awk tutorials if you have any doubt.
There are some other functions which are related to Input/Output. system() function helps us to run any unix command within awk.
"""Now, we will run the unix command date through awk command."""
"""In the terminal, type the command as shown here. And press Enter."""
Today’s date and time is displayed on the terminal as an output.
"""Now, why do we need this? We have kept only the BEGIN section of the awk command."""
"""In real world scenarios, we may want to print the system date, before displaying the required output."""
"""In that case, we would need to execute system commands from awk command."""
"""There are some functions dealing with time stamps like - systime(),  strftime()  etc."""
Browse through the Internet to know about these functions.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about different types of built-in functions like- Arithmetic functions,   String functions,   Input/Output functions and   Time stamps functions."""
As an assignment- Write an awk program to print the last field of every record
where name of the student has small u as the third letter using the awkdemo.txt file.

Hello everyone. Welcome to the tutorial on Building GUIs using Netbeans.
"""In this tutorial, we will see one of the most attractive features of Netbeans which is its GUI Builder."""
What does Netbeans provide for building GUI?
It gives you a What You See Is What You Get designer to create your GUI.
"""Also, it gives you an easy interface to drag-and-drop components to create your layout."""
It comes with a component Palette with  pre installed AWT and Swing components.
We will be making use of this powerful visual editor to build a complete GUI application in just a few minutes.
"""For this demonstration, I'm using a system that has the Linux Operating system Ubuntu version 11.04 and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1."
"""For more details on the installation and requirements, please refer to the previous tutorial."""
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to use the Form Editor, Source Editor The Palette, Inspector and Properties features, add event handlers and also Compile and run our application."
Let's get started and build a simple Account balance application in this tutorial.
"""For this application, we want to be able to-"""
Input the amount credited to the account.
The amount debited from the account.
And compute the final balance.
We will also add a picture to make our application look more attractive.
Let's also have a menu bar on top for easy and quick navigation.
Let's now move to netbeans and start by creating a new project.
"""From the File menu, choose New Project > and choose a Java Application. Say Next"""
and give your project a name.
"""I will name my project as """"Account balance""""."""
Don't create a Main Class but set it as the Main Project.
Say Finish.  That should create a new project in your IDE.
"""Now, go back to File in the File menu and select  New File ."""
"""Choose Swing GUI Forms, under Categories"""
"""and  Jframe Form, under File Type."""
Say Next.
"""I'm going to call this """"AccountBalance"""" as well."""
But you can give it any other name you wish to.
"""Once you say Finish, it takes you to the main Design area."""
Let's get familiar with the GUI builder.
"""On the right, here is the Palette."""
This contains the pre-installed Swing and AWT components.
"""Down here, below the palette,  is the Properties window."""
This shows you the properties of the components as you choose them.
"""On the left,  here is the Navigator or the inspector"""
which  shows you the components that have been added to the frame
"""here, on the workspace, in the Design mode."""
"""On the top, here is the Source button."""
"""When you click on it, it takes you to the source code."""
"""As you add components to the design,"""
it takes the corresponding source code and adds it to the source here.
Let's go back to Design mode and see what components we'll use today.
We will be using some of the components from  the palette
"""such as Buttons, Labels, Panels,  Tabbed pane etc. to create our applications."""
"""Now, from  the  Palette, let us choose a Tabbed Pane under swing Containers."""
Select Tabbed Pane and click on the form.
This should give you a Tabbed frame. You can re-size it using your mouse.
"""Now, go back to the Palette and choose a Panel."""
And click again on your frame.
That should give you a tab.
Go back and choose another Panel. And click on the form again.
That gives you 2 tabs totally.
"""Now, you can rename the tab by either double-clicking on the tab or right-clicking on the tab and selecting the Edit Text option."""
"""I will call the first tab as """"Image"""" and rename the second tab to """"Balance""""."""
"""Now, let's go back to the Palette and add labels from  Swing Controls menu."""
Choose Label from the Swing Controls and add it to your form here.
We are going to need 6 labels for our application.
I have now added  six labels to my form.
You can position and align them as you click them.
"""And, also use the mouse to re-position or re-align them."""
"""Now, to change the text on a label-"""
You can either double-click on it or right-click on it
and  choose the option Edit Text.
Let us rename the labels now.
"""I'm going to call the first one as """"Initial Amount"""","""
"""the second label as """"Credit Amount"""","""
"""the third one as """"Debit Amount"""""""
"""and the fourth one as """"Balance""""."""
"""Initially, we'll set the Initial Amount to be Rs 5000."""
"""Once we compute the balance, we can put it into this label."""
"""But for now, we will just make it as stars."""
"""Now, go back to the Palette and choose a Text Field  and we will add two text fields, one each next to the Credit Amount and to the Debit Amount."""
We should also leave the Text field places blank.
Let me edit the text and remove the existing text here.
Let us resize it using the mouse.
"""Once you have done that, you can now go back to palette and choose a Button."""
Add the button below your frame and
you can change the label by right-clicking on it.
"""Choose the Edit Text option and name it as """"Get Balance""""."""
"""Now, this is our GUI!"""
Let's now go to the Image tab (tab1) and add an image.
"""To do that, let's go back to the Palette"""
and choose another Label and drop it on the panel.
"""Now, from the Properties  window below the palette, search for the icon property and click on the 3 dots here, on the right."""
The icon properties window opens.
"""Here, choose the option External Image, click on the (...) 3 dots again here, on the right."""
"""And, look for the image you want to include in your application."""
I have selected the image here. Click on OK.
Let us re-position it using the mouse.
You can remove the text here on the label by double-clicking on it and removing the text.
Now we have added in image.
Let us next add a menu to our GUI.
"""Go to the palette and select the Menu bar option, under swing menus."""
Choose Menu Bar and click here on top of the panel.
"""By default, it already has 2 menu labels: File and Edit."""
Double-click on the Edit Text and  rename it to Help.
You can also add a sub-menu  under File.
"""Now, in the Inspector or the Navigator on the left side, right-click on  JMenu1."""
Choose Add From Palette  option  and select Menu Item.
That should add a Menu Item.
You can also rename that to say Exit.
"""Now, we have added a sub-menu under the File menu and renamed that menu item as well."""
"""Now, our GUI is more or less complete."""
Let's now look at a preview.
Click on the 'Preview Design' button on the top.
That shows a preview of what you have done so far.
"""Here, the buttons don't work yet."""
"""But once you add in the code, you can have everything working."""
Let us close the preview.
"""Now, before adding the code, let's give proper variable names to the input text fields."""
"""Go to the Balance tab, let us give proper variable names to these text fields here."""
Right-click on JTextfield1 in the inspector.
Select Change Variable Name.
"""Let us change the variable name to  """"creditAmount""""."""
Click on OK.
"""You can also right-click on the text field here, in the Design mode."""
Select Change Variable Name
"""and change variable name into  """"debitAmount""""."""
"""I'm also going to call this final label i.e. the stars text field's label as """"resultBalance""""."""
"""Select the Change Variable Name  option again and change the variable to """"resultBalance""""."""
Click on OK.
"""Let's now see the code, to get the application working."""
"""Now, this is my sample code."""
"""What I want here is, to getText() from the """"creditAmount"""";"""
"""getText() from the """"debitAmount"""","""
"""compute the balance and place the amount in the final """"resultBalance""""."""
Let us  copy the code here and let us go back to the IDE.
"""Now, right-click on the Get Balance button."""
Choose the option Events >>  Action and Action Performed.
This will take you to the section of the code
where you will have to write or paste the code for the action to be performed on the button press.
Let me paste the copied code here.
Let's save this code and go back to the Design mode.
"""Now, let's add in the code to exit the application."""
Right-click on the Menu Item >> Exit and choose  Events >> Action and Action Performed.
It switches to the Source mode and now we have to write the code to exit successfully from the application.
That is going to be System.exit(1).
Now save the code and go back to Design mode.
Let us also add a shortcut to the Exit menu item.
"""Double-click on the shortcut option here, in the window that opens."""
Give the key stroke as Q and Ctrl and click on OK.
"""So, now we have set Ctrl Q as the keyboard shortcut to quit from the application."""
That's it. Our application is now complete..
Let's now run the application by pressing F6 on your keyboard.
It has already selected the main class that has to run.
"""And, here it is! This is our GUI."""
"""Now, let's run a check."""
"""Go to the Balance tab, enter the Credit Amount with Rs. 300/-"""
"""and  the Debit Amount as Rs. 200. And, say 'Get Balance'."""
That gives us the correct amount in the Balance.
Let us now exit from the application.
I'll go to File menu and I'll click on Exit.
We could have also quit the application by pressing Ctrl Q on the keyboard.
"""Now, with the application complete, it's time for the assignment."""
The task is to create a Temperature convertor application.
"""It should have two tabs like the previous one,"""
1 to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and another for Fahrenheit to Celsius.
It should also take an input  temperature
and display the converted temperature.
It should also have a menu bar on top that shows File and Help options.
"""And, under the File menu, have an Exit item with a keyboard shortcut to exit from the application."""
I have already solved the assignment.
Let us see how it should look.
I'm going to run my assignment and this is my GUI.
"""Now, let us enter the input temperature as -40 Celcius and let me click on Get Fahrenheit."""
The application should give the correct converted output temperature.
"""Now, let us  try the short-cut key to Exit i.e.  Ctrl X  to exit from  the application."""
"""So, we have successfully exited from the application upon the keyboard shortcut."""
"""If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch the videos."""

This tutorial has been contributed by IT for Change.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Pointers in C and C++ .
In this tutorial we will learn:
Pointers
To create Pointers
And operations on Pointers.
We will do this with the help of an example.
"To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10, gcc and g++ compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu."
Let us start with an introduction to pointers.
Pointers point to the locations in memory.
Pointers store the memory address.
It also gives value stored at that address.
"""Now, let us see an example on pointers."""
Note that our file name is pointers_demo.c.
Let us go through the code now.
This is our header file as stdio.h.
This is our main() function.
"""Here we have long integer num, assigned value 10."""
Then we have declared a pointer ptr.
Asterisk sign is used to declare a pointer.
This pointer can point to type long  int.
"""In the 'printf' statement, ampersand is used for retrieving memory address of the variable."""
"""So, ampersand num (&num) will give the memory address of num."""
This statement will print the address of the variable num.
"""Over here, ptr stores the address of num."""
This statement will print the address of ptr.
sizeof() function will give the size of ptr.
This is will give the value of ptr.
That is the memory address of num.
And here asterisk ptr will give the value at the address.
"""So, using asterisk will not give the memory address."""
Instead it will give the value.
%ld is a format specifier for the long int.
"""Now, let us execute the program."""
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space  pointers underscore demo dot c space hyphen o space point and press Enter."
Type dot slash point. Press Enter.
The output is displayed.
We see that the num address and ptr value is same
where as memory address of num and ptr are different.
Then the size of pointer is 8 bytes. Also the value pointed by ptr is 10 which was assigned to num.
Now let us see the same program in  C++.
Note that our file name is pointer underscore demo.cpp.
Here we have a few changes like the header file as iostream.
Then we are using the std namespace.
And here we have the cout function in place of printf() function.
Rest all the things are similar.
Let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space pointers_demo.cpp space hyphen o space point1, press Enter."""
"""Type dot slash point1, press Enter."""
We can see that the output is similar to our C program.
Come back to our slide.
"""Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt:"""
About the pointer.
To create a pointer.
And operation on pointer.
"""As an assignment, write a C and C++ program to declare a variable and pointer. Store the address of variable in the pointer and print the value of the pointer."
Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Installing Software in Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to install software in Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System via: Terminal,"""
Synaptic Package Manager and  Ubuntu Software Center.
"""To record this tutorial, I’m using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System."""
"""To proceed with this tutorial, you must be connected to the internet."""
You need to be a System Administrator or have Administrator rights to install software.
Synaptic Package Manager is a graphical program for a p t.
It is a GUI for the apt-get command line utility.
"""By default, Synaptic Package Manager will not be pre-installed in Ubuntu Linux 16.04."""
"""So, let us learn how to install it via terminal."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys together on your keyboard."""
"""Now, in the terminal, type: sudo space a p t hyphen get space install space s y n a p and press the Tab key."""
This will display list of software that starts with s y n a p.
Now complete the word as synaptic and press Enter.
You will be prompted to enter your administrator password.
Enter your admin password.
"""While typing password in the terminal, it will not be visible to us. So, type it carefully."""
Now the terminal  displays the list of packages to be installed.
"""And, information about the size of the files to be downloaded and disk space after installation."""
Press Y to confirm this.
"""The installation begins now. Depending upon your internet speed, this may take some time to finish."""
Now we have successfully installed Synaptic Package Manager.
Let us close the terminal.
"""To confirm the installation, go to Dash home. In the search bar, type synaptic."""
We can see the Synaptic Package Manager icon in the search result.
Now let us learn how to install software using Synaptic Package Manager.
Click on the Synaptic Package Manager icon.
An authentication dialog-box appears asking for the password.
Let us type the admin password and press Enter.
"""When we use the Synaptic Package Manager for the first time, an introduction dialog-box appears."""
This dialog-box has information on how to use Synaptic Package Manager.
Click on the Close button to close this dialog-box.
Let us configure Proxy and Repository in Synaptic Package Manager.
We have to do this before installing an application or package.
Go to Settings and click on Preferences.
There are several tabs on the Preferences window which appears on the screen.
Click on Network to configure the Proxy settings.
There are two options under the Proxy Server – Direct Connection and Manual Proxy.
I will be using Direct Connection. You may select your preferred option.
Click on the OK button at the bottom to close the window.
"""Now, again go to Setting and click on Repositories."""
Software & Updates window appears on the screen.
There are several sources to download Ubuntu software.
Click on Download From drop-down menu and hold the mouse button to see the list of repositories.
Other shows a list of servers across the globe.
"""To close this window, click on the Cancel button at the bottom."""
I am using Server for India as shown here.
Click on the Close button to close the Software Sources window.
"""If you are using Synaptic Package Manager for the first time, you need to reload the packages."""
"""To do this, click on Reload button on the toolbar."""
This may take a few seconds.
Look here. We see that the packages are being transferred through the Internet and are getting updated.
I will now install the VLC player as an example.
Let us go to the Search field which is present on the toolbar.
"""In the Search dialog-box, type vlc and then click on the Search button."""
Here we can see all the VLC packages that are listed.
"""To select the VLC package, right click on the check box. And, select the option Mark for installation from the menu that appears."""
A dialog box appears showing all the list of repository packages.
Click on Mark button to mark all the dependencies packages automatically.
Go to the toolbar and click on the Apply button.
A Summary window appears showing the details of the packages to be installed
Click on the Apply button at the bottom to start the installation.
The process of installation will take some time.
This depends on the number and the size of the packages to be installed.
"""Applying Changes window will be closed, as soon as the installation gets completed."""
Close the Synaptic Package Manager window.
"""Now, let us verify whether the VLC player has been successfully installed."""
Go to the Dash home.
"""In the search bar, type vlc."""
We can see the VLC icon in the displayed list. Click on it to open it.
"""Likewise, we can install other applications using Synaptic Package Manager."""
Next we will learn how to install software via Ubuntu Software Center.
Ubuntu Software Centre is an application that allows us to manage software on Ubuntu Linux OS.
"""You can use it to search, download, install, update or uninstall a software."""
It also gives you information about the software even before you use it.
"""To open Ubuntu Software Center, go to the launcher."""
Click on the icon Ubuntu Software.
The Ubuntu Software Centre window appears.
"""At the top, we can see 3 tabs - All, Installed and Updates."""
Click on All tab.
We can see a search bar at the top.
This will help us to search the available software.
"""Now, let us install the software Inkscape."""
"""In the search bar, type inkscape."""
A short information about Inkscape is displayed.
"""Now, click on the Install button at the right corner."""
The Authentication dialog box appears.
Enter your admin password and then click on Authenticate button.
The progress bar indicates that Inkscape is being installed.
Installation may take a while depending on the number and size of the packages being installed.
The progress is also indicated in the Installed tab at the top. Click on it.
You can access other applications while any installation is being done.
Click on the word Inkscape.
This will display the information about Inkscape.
"""Once Inkscape is installed, we can see two buttons Remove and Launch next to it."""
"""If you want to uninstall the software, simply click on the Remove button."""
"""To launch the application, click on the Launch button. Let me click on it."""
This will launch the Inkscape application.
"""Go back to Ubuntu Software Center. Click on the back arrow button at the top left, and come back to the main screen."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Layers and Boolean operations using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Layers"""
Filters Boolean operations.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.48.4"
Let us open Inkscape. Go to Dash homeand type Inkscape.
Click on the Inkscape logo.
Let's open the Assignment_2.svg file that we created earlier.
I had saved it in Documents folder.
"""First, we will learn about Layers in Inkscape."""
Go to Layer menu and click on Layers option.
"""Now, the Layer palette is opened on the right side of the interface."""
"""By default, a layer is there. You can see, that is named as Layer 1."""
"""To add or create a new layer, click on the plus icon on the Layer palette."""
A dialog box named Add layer opens up.
"""In the Layer name text box, we can assign a name to the layer."""
I will name this layer as eye.
"""Now, we can decide the position of the layer by clicking on the Position drop-down list."""
There are 3 options here.
Above current will keep this layer on top of the current layer.
Below current will place this layer below the current layer.
As sublayer of current indicates that it will be a part of the current layer.
I will position it as Above current and click on the Add button.
Notice a new layer named eye is now visible in the Layer palette.
"""In a similar way, create another layer named bow."""
Now we have 3 layers in the Layer palette.
"""Next, let us learn to rename a layer."""
"""First, double click on Layer 1. And then rename it as circle and press Enter."""
Coming back to our canvas... there are 2 eyes and a bow.
Let us move these shapes to the 2 different layers that we created.
Select both the eyes by dragging the mouse.
Now press Ctrl + X on your keyboard. The eyes have now disappeared.
Now click on the eye layer in the Layer Palette.
Come back to the canvas and press Ctrl + Alt + V.
Repeat the same action for the bow shape.
Click on any empty space on the canvas to deselect all the objects.
The eye and lock icons help to hide and lock layers.
"""When you hide a layer, you are able to see the objects on the subsequent lower layers clearly."""
"""When you lock a layer, you are able to prevent accidental edits to that particular layer."""
These are particularly useful when we have to work on large and complex graphic assignments.
"""Notice 2 icons namely- an eye and a lock, on the left of each layer."""
We will now learn how to use these.
"""To lock or unlock layers, click on the lock icon. I have now locked the bow layer."""
"""Note that if a layer is locked, we cannot make any changes to that layer."""
Let's try to select the bow on the canvas. You will notice that it is not possible to do so.
"""Now, I will unlock the bow layer."""
"""Now, I am able to select the bow object and change its properties as well."""
"""To make a layer visible or invisible on the canvas, click on the eye icon to the left of the layer."""
I am clicking on the eye icon for the bow layer.
Observe what happens on the canvas.
"""Now, let me duplicate the bow layer."""
Go to Layer menu and click on Duplicate Current Layer option.
Notice a new layer named bow copy is created in the Layer Palette window.
"""But, we cannot see the new bow on the canvas. That is because the bow object is overlapped on the previous layer."""
Select the bow on the top layer and move it to one side to see both the bows.
Select the circle layer.
Draw an ellipse on the canvas encircling the eyes and the bows. Color it orange.
The ellipse is seen in the background with the other objects visible above it.
The four icons next to the plus icon in the Layers Palette help to position the selected layer.
The first icon raises the selected layer to be the topmost layer.
The circle layer is currently selected.
"""Observe that on clicking, the circle layer now becomes the topmost layer."""
The last icon lowers the selected layer to be the bottom-most layer.
Click on this icon. Observe that the circle layer is now the bottom-most layer.
"""The second icon raises the selected layer, one layer above."""
Click on this icon. The circle layer has moved above the eye layer. So the eyes are not visible.
"""The third icon lowers the selected layer, one layer below."""
Click on this icon. Now the circle layer has moved below the eye layer.
"""So, that is how these four icons can be used."""
The minus icon at the end will delete the selected layer. Select the bow copy layer and click on it.
Observe that the bow copy layer is no longer seen.
Blend mode is a shortcut to apply the Blend filter to an entire layer.
"""This means that if objects overlap on the selected layers, Inkscape will do a pixel-by-pixel blend of the two objects."""
"""So, keep the circle layer on the top to make the filters visible."""
Click on the drop-down list of the Blend mode. Notice there are 5 options.
"""The first option, that is Normal, does not add any filter to the layer."""
"""Let me click on it. Observe, no filter is added to the layer."""
"""Next, click on Multiply."""
Notice that objects on the topmost layer filters the light so that the objects on the bottom layers are visible.
"""At the same time, it also blends or mixes the colors to form darker colors in the overlap regions."""
Next option is Screen.
Observe the top objects; they add lightness to the bottom objects.
"""So, it blends or mixes the colours to form lighter colours in the overlap regions."""
"""Select Darken. The objects on the top layer, darken the objects on the bottom layers."""
"""Now, let us select the last option that is Lighten. Here the top objects lighten the bottom objects."""
"""If at any time you return the Blend mode back to Normal, the blend filters applied so far disappear."""
We can see many more filters in the Filters menu.
"""To apply any particular filter, first select the object and then click on the desired filter."""
Move the circle layer to the bottom again.
Let me select an eye. Go to Filters menu. Select Blur and Fancy blur.
Observe the changes on the eye.
Let me select the other eye. Go to Filters menu. Select Bevel and Smart jelly.
Once again observe the changes applied to the eye.
"""Now, select the bow. Go to Filters menu. Select Scatter and Air spray."""
The bow appears as if it has been air-sprayed.
"""The Opacity option, right below the Blend mode, helps to reduce the opacity of the selected layer."""
Adjust the Opacity level and observe the change in the ellipse.
"""Next, we will learn about Boolean operations."""
Go to Path menu. These are the available Boolean operations.
Keep the available shapes aside.
Draw a square of green color and a circle of red color. Keep the circle above the square towards the side.
Select both. Go to Path menu and click on Union. Observe the 2 shapes are now joined together.
Now press Ctrl + Z on your keyboard to undo this action.
Again select both.
Go to Path menu. Click on Difference and observe what happens.
Press Ctrl + Z again to undo this action.
Again select both the objects. Go to Path menu and click on Intersection and observe the change in the shape.
Press Ctrl + Z again to undo this action.
Again select both the objects. Go to Path menu and click on Exclusion and observe the change in the shape.
Again press Ctrl + Z.
Once again select both objects. Go to Path menu and click on Division.
Click on the divided circle and move that part aside to see the result.
"""Now, press Ctrl + Z twice to undo these actions."""
Select both objects again. Go to Path menu and click on Cut Path.
Observe the change in the shape.
Cut Path option works only if the object has stroke. Un-select the shapes first.
"""Now, select any one of the strokes and move it aside to make the cut path visible."""
"In this tutorial, we learnt about:"""
Layers Filters and Boolean Operations.
Here are 4 assignments for you:
Create a rectangle with pink color and a triangle with green color.
Keep the triangle on the top of the rectangle.
Select both. Use Union. It should look like a home icon.
Name the layer as home.
Draw  2 circles.
Keep one on top of the other.
Select both and use Difference.
It should look like a crescent.
Draw an ellipse.
Create a star with 10 corners.
Keep it in the centre of the ellipse.
Select both and apply Exclusion.
Create 2 layers named crescent and star respectively.
Cut the crescent shape and paste in crescent layer.
"""In a similar way, do for the star shape."""
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create patterns in Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, We will learn to create patterns using: Cloning Pattern along path Spray tool and  Path effect editor."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS  Inkscape version 0.48.4"""
Click on the Star tool and draw a star in the canvas.
Now click on the Selector tool.
"""On the Tools controls bar, change the Width and Height parameters to 40."""
Zoom in and click on the star once.
Observe that the pivot point is visible now. It's the plus shape in the centre of the star object.
"""Click and move the pivot point far away from the star, as demonstrated here."""
"""Now, go to Edit menu, click on Clone and then on Create Tiled clones."""
A new dialog box opens up. You can find many tabs and many options under each tab.
"""Under Symmetry tab, we can see a drop-down menu with various methods. For this 'demo', we will keep the option simple translation."""
Change the rows and columns parameters to 1 and 40 respectively.
"""Next, go to Shift tab. Change the percentage of Shift X parameter under Per column to -100, as shown here."""
"""Next, let us go to Rotation tab. Change the Angle under Per column to 10."""
"""Now, click on Create button. Observe, a circle pattern is formed with the star."""
"""Likewise, you can use the other options under Create Tiled clones  to make many beautiful patterns."""
Let us move this star circle aside.
"""Next, we will learn how to create a pattern along a path."""
Select Rectangle tool and draw a rounded rectangle. Color it green. Then click on the Selector tool.
"""On the Tool controls bar, change the Width to 540 and Height to 250."""
"""Next, draw a star pattern using the Star tool."""
"""Click on the Selector tool. On the Tool controls bar, change the Width and Height to 50."""
Place it on the top left border of the rectangle.
Select both the shapes. Go to Extensions menu.
Click on Generate from path and then on Pattern along Path.
Change the Copies of the patterns option to Repeated and the Deformation type option to Ribbon.
"""Click on Apply button and Close button. Observe, a beautiful pattern is formed around border of the rectangle."""
Let us now create another pattern using Path effects.
Select Bezier tool and draw a wavy path.
Go to Path menu. Click on Path Effects Editor. A dialog box opens up.

"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
Let's start the tutorial with an e-mail which I got.
I got an email by David Vansalan and he asked me how to draw simple figures with geometries with GIMP.
"""So, let's first start with the most easy way i.e with the straight line."""
"""A straight line can be difficult to draw but if you make a point here and press the shift key and make another point, you can easily draw a straight line."""
"""So, these are straight lines."""
Press Ctrl + Z to Undo.
A square is a bit more complicated.
Just go to toolbox and select the Rectangle tool.
And keep the Aspect ratio as 3 by 3.
"""So, it should be a square."""
"""Now, I have a square selection. So, go to Edit >> Stroke Selection."""
I can do some changes here.
I can fix the Line width or I can use the paint tool and I select Paintbrush in paint tool and click on Stroke.
And here you have your square.
"""If I want to fill this square, it's easy, just go here to my colour pallet and drag the black colour into the square."""
The same can be done with the ellipse selection.
I just can select Ellipse and go to Edit and select Stroke Selection.
"""For more complicated figures, select Paths Tool."""
"""I can create a path by making points and when I click on the last point, my path is finished."""
Then I can go here to Edit and start to modify these handles the way you want to.
You can practice it and understand.
It's very easy.
The last thing I want to do is stroke the path.
"""And I get the same options here and when I click on Stroke, I have a perfect line."""
It's not a straight line but its perfect line.
And this was it for this week.
"""For more information go to http://meetthegimp.org and if you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org. Good bye."""
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on custom exceptions.
In this tutorial we will learn about:  Custom exceptions and  Usage of throw and throws keywords
"""To record this tutorial, I am using :Ubuntu Linux 16.04 OS JDK 1 .7 and Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have basic knowledge of Exceptions Handling in Java. If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
First let us learn about custom exceptions.
Custom exception is a user defined exception class.  It is usually created as checked exceptions.
It is used to customize the exception according to user need.
Now we will open eclipse and create a new project called CustomExceptionDemo.
Inside this project we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate custom exceptions.
We will create a new class InvalidMarkException.
"""To make this as a type of exception class, it should be a subclass of Java exception class."""
"""To do so, type extends Exception."""
Click on Source menu and then select Generate constructors from Superclass.
Now click on Deselect All button in the right hand side.
Then select the constructor with a single string argument and click on OK button at the bottom.
This string argument can be used to customize the message shown when this exception occurs.<<PAUSE>>
Let us add another class named StudentMarks.
Then type the following code.
This class contains only one variable named marks.
This constructor initializes the value of marks.
Let us now add a method to validate the marks.
The normal range of marks is from 0 to 100.
"""If marks less than 0 or greater than 100 is processed, InvalidMarkException will be thrown."""
"""For this, we need to use the throw keyword explicitly to throw a custom exception."""
"""If the mark is a valid one, the message “Entry OK” will be displayed."""
We can see that there is an error InvalidMarkException.
Let us check and resolve it.
So click on the error and double click “Add throws declaration”.
We can see that the error disappears once the “throws InvalidMarkException” is added to the method signature.
Here we can see that the throws keyword is used along with methods.
It indicates that the method will raise the specified exception.
We have to provide the exception handling code when such a method is called.
"""Next, let us perform a file access operation which will raise a FileNotFoundException."""
So type the following code to create an instance of a FileReader class.
Eclipse will show some errors as we have not imported the corresponding Java packages.
"""To rectify the same, click on the error and then double click import 'FileReader' (java.io)."""
We will learn about package and its usage in detail in a later tutorial.
"""To allow fr to access a file called Marks which is located in the home folder, type the following code."""
The path shown here is to be replaced with that of your system's home folder.
An error shows that this line of code can raise a FileNotFoundException.
We can resolve it by adding this exception in the throws clause.
We can see that FileNotFoundException is also added to the throws clause.
We can handle multiple exceptions using throws as shown here.
We will now create the main method inside the StudentMarks class and verify the results.
Here we create an object m1 initialized with 40 as the value for marks.
In04: the next line we invoke the method validate using the object m1.
We can see that there is an error when the validate method is invoked.
It says that this method will raise the  InvalidMarkException and FileNotFoundException
"""To resolve the error, we can add throws clause to main method as we did earlier"""
But it is recommended to use try and catch block.
"""So, double click Surround with try/catch."""
Now the necessary try-catch blocks are added and the exception has been handled.
Now let us run this program.
It displays “Entry OK” and “rest of the code”.
This happens because the value of marks 40 is a valid entry.
Let us now change the value to -10 which is an invalid entry.
We will run the program again.
Now we can see that the InvalidMarkException is thrown as -10 is an invalid entry.
"""Since we have handled the exception, we can see the message “rest of the code”"""
"""Instead if we use “throws” clause, this message “rest of the code” will not be printed."""
Also the program will be terminated.
So it is better to use a try catch block when a method is called inside the main method.
With this we come to the end of this tutorial.
In this tutorial we have learned about :What is a Custom Exception Usage of throw and throws keywords How to create and use custom exceptions.
As an assignment :Create a custom exception class called InvalidAgeException
Create another class Age and create a constructor to initialize the value of age
Also create a method validate to throw an exception if the age is less than 18
Create objects inside the main method and invoke the validate() method
Provide exception handling using try-catch blocks wherever required.
Verify the custom exception class.

"""Remember, before adding any target Z39.50 server please ensure the Host Connection Reliability."""
I will click on the Title : Library of Congress.
"""A new page with the heading Library of Congress, opens."""
"""Keep this page open, as we will need the details on this page a little later."""
"""Now, let us go back to the New Z39.50 server page that we had left open earlier in this tutorial."""
and start filling in the necessary details on this page.
The details are in the Library of Congress page which we have kept open.
So let’s start.
"""On the New Z39.50 server page, for Server name, type Library of Congress."""
"""This detail is from the section Name, in the Library of Congress page."""
I have filled in a few other details on the New Z39.50 server page which I had noted from the Library of Congress page.

Please note that the fields marked in red are mandatory.
"""Next, we see the check-box Preselected (searched by default)."""
"""Click this if you want the database of this particular library to be searched always, by default. I will leave it unchecked."""
"""Now we come to the field for Rank (display order). If you want this library to be listed at the top of the list of Libraries, then enter 1 here."""
Note that if you want to add multiple z39.50 targets you can arrange them as per the rank.
"""For Syntax, from the drop down, I will select MARC21/USMARC. You may choose any Syntax as per your requirement."""
"""For Encoding, Koha by default, selects utf8. I will leave it as it is."""
But you may select any other value as per your requirement.
Next is Time out (0 its like not set).
"""Here, type the number of seconds that you wish to wait for the results to appear. I will enter 240."""
"""For Record type, Koha by default, auto selects Bibliographic. On doing so, each record will have a Bibliographic detail."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Configuring Settings in KTouch.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to:"""
Change the level of training Adjust the speed of typing.
Configure shortcut keys.Configure the toolbars.View typing metrics.
"""Here, we are using KTouch 1.7.1 on Ubuntu Linux 11.10."""
Let’s open KTouch.
We are at Level 1. Let us move on to the second level that is 2.
"""To increase the level of the training to 2, click on the top triangle symbol, next to the Level field."""
Notice what happens when we change the level to 2.
The characters in the Teacher’s Line change!
Look at the characters displayed under the New Characters in This Level field. They’ve changed too!
These are the characters that are to be practiced for the selected level.
"""Now, let’s start typing."""
Now let us type a character that is not displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
The Student's Line changes to red.
What else do you see?
The percentage displayed in the Correctness field decreases.
Let’s press backspace and delete the mistake.
Let us learn to set Training Options.
What are Training Options?
We use 'Training Options' to change the parameters for typing speed and correctness (percentage of typing accuracy).
We can also customize the number of lines that can be typed in a particular level.
"""From the main menu, select Settings and click Configure KTouch."""
The Configure – KTouch dialog box appears.
"""From the left panel of the Configure – KTouch dialog box, click Training Options."""
The right panel now displays the various 'Training Options'.
"""Let’s set the upper limit for the Typing speed, Correctness and Workload."""
"""Under Limits to increase a level, let us:"""
"""set the Typing Speed to 120 characters per minute, Correctness to 85%."""
Finally let’s set Workload to 1.
This means that we need to complete only one line in each level.
We then will automatically move to the next level.
"""If you want to complete the training for a level before you proceed to the next level, check the """"Complete whole training level before proceeding"""" box."""
Let’s set the lower limit for the Typing speed and Correctness.
"""Under Limits to decrease a level, let us:"""
set the Typing Speed to 60 characters per minute and Correctness to 60.
Let’s check the box Remember level for next program start.
Click Apply. Click OK.
Changes we made are applied only when we start a new session again.
Click Start New Session and select Keep Current Level.
Let’s start typing again.
Notice that initially the speed is 0. It increases or decreases as we type.
Click Pause Session. When we pause the typing speed remains at the same count.
Let us resume typing.
"""As the speed drops below 60, notice that the red circle next to Speed is glowing."""
"""This indicates that speed has fallen below the lower limit, that is 60, set for the speed."""
"""Now, type the number 4 that is not displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'."""
The 'Student’s Line' turns red.
The percentage of the Correctness drops too.
Can you see the spaces between set of characters or character given in the 'Teacher’s Line'?
"""Now, I shall not press the Space bar after this word."""
The 'Student’s Line' has turned red again!
This means the spaces too must be typed in correctly.
Let us complete typing an entire line in the student’s line and then press Enter.
The Level has changed to 3!
Why does the level change to 3? This is because we have set the Workload to 1.
"""Therefore, when we complete one line for Level 2 and press Enter, we move to the next level."""
Notice that the new characters are displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
Do you want to know the scores of our typing session?
Click Lecture Statistics. The Training statistics dialog box appears.
"""Let’s click on the """"tabs"""" and see what each of them indicate."""
Click on Current Training Session.
"""This displays the general statistics details, rate of typing, accuracy of typing and details of the characters that you need to concentrate on."""
The Current Level Statistics tab displays details similar to the one displayed in the Current Training Session tab.
The Monitor Progress tab displays a graphical representation of the progress of your typing.
Let us close this dialog box.
"""You can also create your own """"shortcut keys""""."""
What are shortcut keys?
"""Shortcut keys are combinations of two or more keys which can be pressed from the keyboard, instead of using the menu options."""
Let us configure a shortcut key to view Lecture Statistics.
"""From the main menu, click Settings > Configure Shortcuts."""
The Configure Shortcuts – KTouch dialog box appears.
In the Search box enter Lecture Statistics.
Click Lecture Statistics. Select Custom and click None. The icon changes to Input.
"""Now, from the keyboard, press the Shift and A keys together."""
"""Notice that the icon now displays the letters """"Shift+A"""". Click OK."""
"""Now, press the Shift and A keys together. The Training Statistics dialog box appears."""
Click Close to exit.

"Thus, We have come to the end of this tutorial."
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Trace bitmap in Inkscape” using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial we will learn the Difference between raster and vector image, Various raster and vector formats, Convert raster image to vector"""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS , Inkscape version 0.91"""
"""The images used as examples in this tutorial, have been provided in the Code Files link."""
Pause the tutorial here and download the images on your machine.
Here are the 2 images on my desktop.
Linux.png is the raster image and Linux.pdf is the vector image.
Let me open them.
Both the images may look similar. We will know the difference only by zooming into the image. Let's do so.
"""Now, the first image looks pixelated because a raster image is made of up pixels."""
But the second image does not pixelate because a vector image is made up of paths.
"""Some of the raster image formats are JPEG, PNG,TIFF,GIF, BMP etc"""
"""Some of the vector image formats are SVG,AI, CGM etc"""
"""The formats that can be both vector and raster are PDF, EPS, SWF"""
Let us now learn how to convert this raster image to vector.
"""Open Inkscape. Now, we will import the raster image."""
Go to File and click on Import.
"""Now, go to Path menu and click on Trace Bitmap."""
A dialog box opens up. Under the Mode tab we can see various options.
"""Make sure the image is selected.  By default, Brightness cutoff option is selected."""
"""Under Preview, check the Live Preview option to observe the changes."""
"""As you can see in the Preview window, Brightness cutoff finds the difference in brightness."""
"""Now click on the second option, that is Edge detection."""
"""As the name indicates, it finds only the edges."""
Color quantization traces along the boundaries of reduced colors.
Invert image will invert the colors of the bitmap if you think it looks better inverted.
I will uncheck the Invert image.
Multiple scans is good for multiple colors.
Brightness steps finds the difference in brightness.
Colors finds an amount of colors specified.
"""Grays is similar to Colors, but finds only grayscale colors. Uncheck the Smooth option, since it creates more smooth lines in the edges."""
Now we have seen all the tracing options. You can choose from any of these according to your requirement.
I will choose Colors options by clicking on it.
Now click on OK and close the dialog box.
The traced image in created on the top of the original image.
Click and move the image to one side in order to see both the images.
The image is now converted into vector. Zoom in to the images.
"""As mentioned earlier the first image gets pixelated, while the second one does not gets pixelated."""
And we can also see the paths very clearly.
"""Now, delete the original image."""
Select the image. Go to Path. Click on Break Apart.
Now double click on the image. Stack of images are created on the top of the other.
Click and drag them aside to make it visible.
Next let us learn how to edit the vector image. I will edit the black image.
So delete the other images.
Make sure the image is selected.
Go to Path. Click on Break Apart.
"""Under Fill and Stroke, reduce the opacity to 50. Now you can see the parts clearly."""
Let us change the colors of the image.
You can change the colors according to your imagination.
Now select all the parts and increase the opacity to 100.
Press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
"""Now let us add some hair-style. To do so, select the image and click on the Nodes tool."""
Add nodes to the head area. Now move the nodes a little up as demonstrated.
Save the image in both raster and vector formats.
"""First save it as raster, that is, in PNG format. Go to File and then click on Save As."""
Change the name as Image-raster. Click on Save.
"""Next let us save the image as vector, that is, in PDF format."""
"""Once again, go to File and click on Save As."""
Change the extension to PDF . Change the name as Image-vector. Click on Save.
Now let us go to the desktop and check both the images.
You can clearly identify the difference between the two images.
That's all for this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt the Difference between raster and vector image Various raster and vector formats, Convert raster image to vector"""
"""As an assignment, select the train image which is given in your code files link and convert it to a vector in Grays."""
Your completed assignment should like this.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on FrontAccounting installation on Windows OS.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to Install XAMPP"""
Do the database setup and Install FrontAccounting in Windows OS
"""To record this tutorial, I‘m using: Windows OS version 10"""
"""Apache, MySQL and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.5.19"""
FrontAccounting version 2.4.7
Firefox web browser and  A working Internet connection.
FrontAccounting is a server based Accounting System. So we will be using XAMPP to setup the web server on our machine.
"""Open a web browser. In the address bar, type this URL and press Enter."""
This will take us to the XAMPP download page.
Here XAMPP is available to download for all operating systems.
The latest version of XAMPP can be downloaded by clicking this green button.

"""Lastly, click on Finish button."""
Now we should check whether XAMPP is successfully installed on our machine or not.
Click on the Windows search bar at the bottom left of the screen and type xampp.
We can see the XAMPP Control Panel in the search list.
Right-click on the XAMPP Control Panel and select Run as administrator.
"""In the XAMPP Control Panel, make sure that Apache and MySQL services are running."""
"""If not, then start these services by clicking on the START button of the respective services."""
You may get some error messages like: “Apache shutdown unexpectedly”
“Port 80 in use for Apache Server'”
This is because the default port allotted to Apache and MySQL are taken by another software.
Default port number for Apache is 80 and for MySQL is 3306.
"""To change these ports, refer to the Additional Reading Material of this tutorial."""
And allot the proper port numbers before proceeding further. For eg: 8080
"""Now, open Firefox web browser."""
"""In the address bar, type localhost and press Enter. We should be able to see the XAMPP screen."""
"""If prompted for language selection, select English. We are now in the XAMPP homepage."""
Let's start downloading FrontAccounting.

"""Once the download completes, open the folder where you have downloaded the file."""
Here is the file which I have downloaded.
Right-click on the file and select Extract Here.
"""Once extracted, I will rename the extracted FrontAccounting folder as account."""
"""Renaming of the folder name is optional. However, it helps to identify multiple instances of FrontAccounting installed on a single machine."""
Now we have to move the folder account into the web server's root directory.
The path for the root directory is “c:\xampp\htdocs”
Right-click on the folder account and select Copy.
"""In the left pane, click on “This PC” which is also called as “My Computer”."""
Then double click on “Local Disk (C:)” that is C drive And go to xampp and htdocs.
"""Inside htdocs, right-click on an empty space and select Paste."""
We have successfully installed the XAMPP server.
Make sure that the FrontAccounting installer is in the web server’s root directory.
Next we need to create a database for FrontAccounting to proceed further.
"""We will do this in phpmyadmin, which is the graphical user interface for MySQL. It comes along with the XAMPP installation."""
Let us go back to the XAMPP Page in the web browser.
"""On the XAMPP page, in the menu at the left, click on phpMyadmin."""
Click on Users in the top menu and then click on Add User.
In the new window that opens enter a User name of your choice. I will type frontacc as my User name.
"""From the Host drop-down list, select Local."""
Enter a password of your choice in the Password text-box.
I will type admin123 as my password.
Type the same password in the Re-type textbox.
Do not click on Generate Password prompt for now.
"""Under Database for user account, we can see the option- Create database with the same name and grant all privileges."""
We will check that option and scroll down.
Then click the Go button at the bottom right of the page.

It means a new database with the name frontacc and with user frontacc has been created.
This user name and password is only for Database login purpose.
"""Make a note of the user name, password and database names."""
These will be required later to complete the FrontAccounting installation.
"""Database name and username need not be the same. To have different names, create the database first and then create a user for that database."""
"""Also, as per naming convention, username should not have any spaces in between."""
We now have XAMPP running and our database is ready.
We are now ready to proceed installing Front Accounting.
In the web browser open a new tab. In the address bar type localhost/account and press Enter.
We can see the FrontAccounting webpage showing Step 1: System Diagnostics
Make sure that Select install wizard language is English.
Scroll down and click on Continue button at the bottom of the page.
The title of the next web page is Step 2: Database Server Settings.
Here I will keep the Server Host as localhost I’ll keep the Server Port as empty.
"""If you have changed the MySQL default port number other than 3306, then enter that port number here."""
Enter the following details which we have created earlier- database Name as frontacc
database user as frontacc
and database password as admin123
Ignore the rest of options and click on Continue button at the bottom.
"""Next, you will need to put the details of your own company. I will demonstrate how to do so."""
"""In Company Name field, I will type ST Company Pvt Ltd."""

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial- More on single dimensional array in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about- Using awk array with file,"""
"""scan the elements of an array,"""
"""Delete statement,"""
ARGV array and ENVIRON array.
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and  gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through previous awk tutorial on array in our website."""
You should have some basic knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
Previously we covered some aspects of awk arrays.
Now let us see how we can use awk array with a file.
We will use the same file awkdemo.txt that we have used earlier.
"""Here, the first field is roll number and sixth field is stipend of the student."""
Let us first calculate the HRA for all students.
"""Here, HRA is 30% of their stipend amount."""
I have already written the code and saved it as calculate_hra.awk. Let us look into that file now.
"""Inside the BEGIN section, the field separator is initialized with the Pipe symbol."""
"""Then, in the action section we are initializing the array elements."""
This section will get executed once for each line of an input file.
"""I have declared """"hra"""" as an array variable and dollar one as index."""
"""Here dollar 1 indicates the 1st field, that is roll number. And, the value is dollar 6 multiplied by zero point 3 wherein dollar six is the stipend value."""
"""So, array hra at index roll number will contain the corresponding HRA amount as a value."""
How can we scan all the elements of this array?
You should use this variation of for loop.
This loop executes statements once for each index in the array.
The variable var will be set to the index values one by one.
The code is written inside END section.
This section will be executed after awk has processed all the lines of the input file.
Variable i will be initialized to every index value or roll number one by one.
"""In each iteration of the for loop, the HRA for a particular roll number will be printed."""
"""Switch to the terminal and execute the file. Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using 'cd' command.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space calculate_hra.awk space awkdemo.txt . Press Enter."""
The output shows the roll number and HRA for all the students.
"""Now say, I want to delete the record for the student with roll S02."""
"""So, we have to delete the array element at index S02."""
Let me do this using the calculate_hra.awk code.
"""Before the for loop, press Enter and type the following code: delete space hra within square brackets within double quotes S02."""
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command. Press Enter.
The record for the student with roll number S02 is not printed in the output.
"""So, any array element can be deleted using the delete command."""
You have to mention the array name with the index.
What if I want to delete an entire array? It can be done by specifying only the array name in the delete statement.
Let us switch to the code to try this.
Delete the index S02 along with the quotes and square brackets from the delete statement.
Clear the terminal. Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command. Now press Enter.
"""See, we are not getting any output. The entire array has been deleted."""
"""Remember, in an earlier tutorial on awk built-in variables, we had said- ARGC implies the number of command line arguments."""
ARGV is an array that stores the command line arguments. How can we show their values? Let us see.
I have already written the code in argc_argv.awk. Let us check the contents.
The code is written within awk BEGIN section.
"""First we are printing the number of arguments, that is the value of ARGC."""
"""Next, using the for loop, we are looping for the value of i from 0 to ARGC-1."""
"""And, we are printing ARGV at index i. Switch to the terminal and execute the file."""
"""Now, type on the terminal- awk space hyphen small f space argc underscore argv dot awk space one space two space three."""
"""Here, one two three are the command line arguments. Press Enter to execute the command."""
We get the number of arguments as 4. But recall that we have supplied only 3 arguments.
"""Let us have a look at the individual arguments. First argument or argv at index 0 is actually awk, the command name."""
"""Next, we have three arguments that we supplied in the command line."""
That is why the value of ARGC is always the number of command line arguments supplied plus one.
Let us take one more example. Built-in variable ENVIRON is an associative array of environment variables.
The array element indices are the environment variable names. The array element values are the values of the particular environment variables.
Let us see how we can see the values of different environment variables.
"""First, let us print our username."""
We need to print the value of environment variable USER.
"""At the command prompt, type the following."""
The output will show the name of the user who logged in.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about- Using awk array with file,"""
"""Scan the elements of an array,"""
"""Delete statement, ARGV array and ENVIRON array."""
As an assignment- Calculate certain allowances for the students who have passed.
"""Paper presentation allowance which is 80% of the stipend,"""
Performance incentive which is 20% of the stipend.
Store the allowances in two different arrays.
Print the total amount required for each allowance and the average.
Print the value of environment variable PATH from awk program.

Hello everyone.Welcome to the tutorial on Introduction to Netbeans IDE.
"""In this tutorial, I will introduce you to the basics of getting started with Netbeans."""
"""Netbeans is a free and open-source Integrated Developement Environment, available at www.netbeans.org."""
It allows for integration of various components.
Supports various scripting languages and advanced text editors.
It also provides a 'GUI' to create and design projects and also supports databases.
"""To finish this tutorial, basic knowledge in the Java programming language is necessary."""
Standard programming terminologies have been used in this tutorial.
To get started with Netbeans-
"""I am using the Linux operating system Ubuntu, version 11.04"""
and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
"""In this tutorial, we will: * look at the installation of Netbeans"""
get familiarized with the interface of Netbeans and
create a sample Java project.
Let us first look at installing the IDE.
Netbeans can be downloaded from netbeans.org.
It is official main site.
"""Click on the """"Download"""" link on the main page of the site."""
"""On the next page which loads,"""
click on the 'Download' link in the last column which includes the download of all the supported technologies that is required by the IDE including the Glassfish Server.
The installation of Netbeans also requires the installation of the Java Development Kit (JDK) which can be downloaded from java.sun.com.
Click on the Get Java link here and select the link to download both the Netbeans and 'JDK' Bundle.
"""In the next page which loads,"""
select the setup file which is compatible with your operating system.
"""On Ubuntu, the setup-file is downloaded as a  '.sh' (dot sh) file"""
i.e as a shell script file.
Run this file by going to the Terminal.
"""Navigate to the window or directory which contains the downloaded setup file and at the prompt,"""
"""type """"sh"""" followed by the name of the downloaded file and press Enter."""
This will start the installer which will take a few moments.
The installer appears on the screen.
You can follow the onscreen instructions to install the IDE on your system.
I will exit the installer now.
Let us now look at the Netbeans window.
To open or launch Netbeans on your Ubuntu Operating System-
Go to the menu item Applications >> Programming and click on the Netbeans IDE icon.
"""When you first launch the IDE, it opens the Netbeans start page."""
The IDE window contains
"""menus in the menu bar,"""
toolbars  and
"""workspaces like the file system window,"""
the run time window and the output window.
"""The  main menu provides most of the commands you need to use Netbeans with, including-"""
"""creating, editing, compiling, running and debugging your projects."""
The tool bar which is present below the menu bar  provides buttons for several frequently used commands on the menu bar.
Workspace is a collection of windows that are used for performing certain types of operations
"""such as editing in the workspace window , execution, output or debugging- which is present below the workspace."""
Let us next create a Sample Java Project.
"""To create a java project, go to the File menu, click on New Project."""
"""In the 'New project' Wizard box, under Categories ,"""
"""select Java. Under Projects, select Java Applications and click Next."""
"""In the Name and Location page  of the wizard,"""
"""give your Project Name as """"KeyboardReader""""."""
Set the Set as Main Project check-box selected and
click Finish.
The project is created and opened in the IDE.
"""Once the project is created, you should be able to  see the Projects window on the left  side of the IDE windows"""
"""which contains a tree view of the components of the project including the source files, Libraries that your code depends on."""
The Source Editor  is on the right with a file called  as  KeyboardReader.java  opened.
"""Now, in the main class, let us enter a sample java code."""
This code reads input from the keyboard and gives an output indicating if the input is a whole number or a floating point number.
I am now copying this code onto my clipboard and pasting it over the existing code in the IDE workspace.
The next step is to run our project.
"""To run any project on the Netbeans IDE, there are 3 methods."""
The first method is- you can click on the project node in the Projects window and choose Run from the contextual menu.
"""Or, you can go to the toolbar and click on the Run Project button."""
"""Or, you can also  press the F6 key on your keyboard to run the project."""
Let me right-click on the Project node and select the Run option.
"""When you run a Java application, the IDE builds and compiles the  application code and runs the program in the output window which appears below the Workspace."""
"""The IDE has now prompted me to """"Enter any Number""""."""
Let me enter a random number and press Enter.
It says if the input is a whole number or a floating point number.
"""Now, to the assignment-"""
"""As an extension to the """"KeyboardInputReader"""" project,"""
"""convert another project i.e. a temperatures converter application which takes an input temperature,"""
converts into Fahrenheit from Celsius and vice-versa.
"""And, displays the converted temperature in the output window."""
I have already constructed the assignment.
Let us run the assignment.
The program has prompted me to enter the input temperature in the output window.
"""Let me enter a sample temperature, -40, in Fahrenheit and it shows me the converted temperature in Celsius."""

Welcome to Meet The GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""I got an e-mail from Jeson in New York and he just stopped the show about Triptychs, to find a different way of doing it, before I started doing triptychs."""
And he found a different way with using layer mask.
And I think I should show you that in this tutorial.
"""I can't show you the image which Jeson used for doing Triptychs because he used images which are not freely available, so I can't use them."""
Using layer mask for doing Triptychs is very easy and I have modified his concept a bit about using a layer mask.
I wonder why I didn't have that idea.
And I want to do a triptych with these three shots here.
"""I want to have this image on the left side, this 2nd one in the middle and this one on the right side."""
I want to change these square frames to something which suits this image.
We will see how this works out.
Now I can start making the Triptychs with these images here and I press tab to bring my toolbox window into the foreground.
Click on File and select New to create a new image and we get the default value of width as 3400 and 1200 for height.
So I have three images of 1000 by 1000 and 100 pixels border between them.
Let's see how that works out.
"""For getting this image into the new image, I drag the 'Background' layer of this image from toolbox to my new image here and you get here 'Background copy'."""
"""This was my left most image, so I rename it as """"left"""" and I press return/Enter after typing."""
So this image should be on the left side.
"""And the next image should be on right side, so I pull the image in the same way and name it accordingly """"right""""."""
"""And this is the third image and this will become my central window, so I pull this image over to the new image and rename this layer as """"center""""."""
"""I make the """"right"""" and """"central"""" layers invisible and now I want to scale the """"left"""" layer a bit down and when I zoom down a bit to say 10%, you can see the borders of this layer and now the full frame"
And now I select the Move tool so that I can move this image and adjust a bit.
The image is not moving because I have selected the center layer.
"""So, I select the left layer and move it and position the bottle."""
"""I want to scale down this layer a bit, so I select the Scale tool from the toolbox and go to the tool info. and click on aspect ratio and in Preview I choose the Image option."""
"""And now, I click into the layer, and pull the info window aside and reduce it from the corner."""
I think more or bit less.
I can grab this image and I can position it where I want to and I think I should have put some guidelines on here.
"""So, I zoom into the image by 100% and go to the top left corner."""
Now I pull the rulers down here for guidelines.
I wondered why I couldn’t move a ruler and here is an option Move the active layer. By selecting it I can move the active layer.
It's a nice option to protect the layers and I select the size of the frame as 100 on the right side and I go down and I set it 1100 and on right side I set it as 1100.
This is the frame for my image.
Shift + Ctrl + E gives me the whole image and now I select the active layer option.
"""And in Zoom Ratio, I select 10%."""
"""I think, I should select 13% and that's enough."""
I click on Scale tool and keep the aspect ratio and pull this Scale window out of the frame.
Now I scale this image.
Now I have the frame to look where I want to place this image.
"""And I think I should make it a bit smaller because I want to have the shades of glass here, in the image."""
Now I click on Scale and I get my scaled image.
"""For getting the frame around the image, I just add a layer mask."""
And I make my layer mask Black i.e full transparency.
And just click on Add.
"""So, now I select a rectangle inside the borders here and fill the rectangle with white."""
"""I pull the white colour over here and you can see that the bottle becomes visible and for completing the frame here, I just zoom into it."""
And I will paint with white with irregular strokes on the layer mask.
"""To do that, I select the Brush tool, go to the dialog here and I select here a soft brush for painting."""
"""Before painting, I have to de-select my selection by pressing Shift + Ctrl + A and now I can start painting with white."""
White is selected.
"""Now I paint with white here around and you see while I am painting white on the layer mask, I am revealing the image below."""
And the painting is irregular but it's ok.
"""Now, I am selecting a different brush and I think this is better."""
I get a fuzzy corner.
I should zoom into the image 100% so that you can see it.
I get kind of fuzzy border here and I will make it a bit more fuzzy in a moment by painting twice above it.
And now you can see that the border is getting a little bit more irregular.
Perhaps this is not the right tool here but you can use different tools and now I want to sharpen  this image.
You can check out that I am still working in the layer mask.
You can check it here.
"""So, click on Filters, Blur, Gaussian Blur and I select high blur count here and I think that's ok."""
And now I have really fuzzy border here around.
So let's look at the  full image.  Shift + Ctrl + E.
I have the 1st part of my triptych and I do the others in the same way.
I have finished with the other images and you can see here I have over painted over the rulers and I can do that here too.
"""Now I want to remove the rulers and new way of doing that is to go to the Image, Image Guides and here I can remove all guides."""
And I found out that I can do a New Guide  here and select the position numerically.
Its wonderful to have this options.
The GIMP has so many options that you cant remember all of them.
Go to View and de-select Layer Boundary.
I want to have this bottle a bit more up into the corner.
I think there is bit more space here and little bit less here.
"""I think the """"right"""" and the """"center"""" image are here at the right corner."""
But I think this bottle should go up there.
"""So, I will go out of full screen mode,"""
"""I de-select the """"center"""" and the """"right"""" layer and concentrate on the """"left"""" layer."""
Now I need the rulers for guidance.
"""So click on Image, Guides, New Guide and type in Horizontal position 100."""
"""Again go to Image, Guides, New Guide and select vertical position as 100."""
"""And now I select my Move tool. Go to the options, select Move the active layer and I just move this up here."""
"""I think I have made a mistake, so I undo the step by pressing Ctrl + z and here you can see that the mask is selected."""
I want to move the layer.
"""So, now I select the image and I just pull it up and the mask moves with it."""
I found no way to lock the mask but I can correct that.
I select the layer mask and pull the layer mask back to my corner here.
I think this looks better now.
And now this image is finished with the help from Jeson in New York.
"""No, this image isn't finished."""
The thing I normally don't forget but I always forget when I am recording because I have to think about such lot of other things than just making my image.
I have again forgotten to save it.
"""Save it as jaegermeister.xcf, xcf contains all the layer information and i will cut out all the stuff about rescaling for the web."""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Using final keyword.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the final keyword and when to invoke it."""
"""We will also learn about -   final variables , final methods , final classes."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:   Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 , JDK 1.7 , Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have basic knowledge of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
You must have knowledge of Subclassing and Method overriding.
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit our website."""
"""First of all, we will learn what final keyword is."""
final is a keyword or reserved word in Java.
"""It can be applied to variables, methods or classes."""
"""Now, let us learn what final variable is."""
"""final variable is a variable whose value cannot be changed. That is, it will be a constant."""
I am switching to Eclipse IDE now. I had already created a project named MyProject in the previous tutorial.
"""So, we will directly go to the Employee class of the project."""
Come to the variable name.
Add final keyword before the variable name. We have made the variable name as final.
"""We will initialize the variable name with value """"sneha""""."""
We will Save and Run the program.
We get compilation error: The final field Employee.name cannot be assigned
This is because here the final variable 'name' is already declared and initialized.
We can initialize a final variable only once.
"""So, we will comment the method setName which modifies the variable name."""
Save  the class.
"""Now, come to TestEmployee class."""
"""Come to the main method and comment the line manager.setName(""""Nikkita Dinesh"""");"""
We commented this line as it was instance of method setName.
We have already commented setName method in Employee class.
Now let us Save the class and Run the program.
"""Great!!! We got the output,  Name: Sneha  ,Email: abc@gmail.com Manager of: Accounts ."""
We got this output as we already initialized variables with these values in  TestEmployee class and Employee class.
Now come to the final variable name in Employee class.
"""Remove the initialization of final variable name.  That is, remove “sneha”."""
Uncomment the method setName.
Save and Run the program.
We get the error: The final field Employee.name cannot be assigned
"""This is because, if the final variable is not initialized, then only constructor can initialize it."""
"""That is, it cannot be modified anywhere else in the program."""
"""For that, let’s create a constructor in the Employee class.  We have already learnt what a constructor is earlier."""
We know that constructor has the same name as class name.
"""So, we will type:  Employee, parentheses, open and close curly brackets and inside the curly brackets, let's initialize the variable name with value sneha semicolon."""
Comment the method setName.
Save and Run the program.
We got the desired output.
final variable is successfully initialized in a constructor.
Now we will learn about final static variables.
Come to the final variable in Employee class.
Add static keyword before final keyword.  We have made the final variable as static.
Save and Run the program.
We get error: The final field Employee.name cannot be assigned
This is because static final variables cannot be initialized in the constructor.
They must be assigned a value with their declaration. Or they must be declared in a static block.
static variables are shared among all the objects of a class.
Creating a new object would change the static variable.  This is not allowed if the static variable is final.
Switch back to Eclipse IDE.
"""So, now we will create a static block."""
"""For that, in the Employee class, come to the constructor we created."""
"""Here, instead of Employee parenthesis , we will type static.  We have created a static block."""
Now we will Save and Run the program.
We got the desired output. We have successfully initialized static final variable.
Now let’s use final variable as a parameter to the method.
Come to the method setEmail in Employee class.
Add final keyword before String newEmail. We have made the parameter as final.
Save and Run the program.
We got the desired output.
"""Now, come to the method setEmail.  Inside the method, we will type: newEmail is equal to abc@gmail.com semicolon"""
We have modified the final variable newEmail.
Once again we will Save & Run the program.
We get error: The final local variable newEmail cannot be assigned.
This is because final variable as parameter to a method cannot be modified by that method.
"""So, let's remove the variable modification."""
Now we will learn about final method.  Come to the method getDetails in employee class.
Add final keyword before method getDetails. We have made the method as final.
Save and Run the program.
We get error: class Manager overrides final method getDetails().
Come to the method getDetails() in Manager class.
"""This is because if you make any method as final, you cannot override it."""
Manager class method getDetails overrides getDetails method in Employee class.
What if final method is private?
private methods are not inherited by the child class.
"""So, we can add a method getDetails() in the child class. You can try this as an assignment."""
Switch back to Eclipse IDE.
"""In Employee class, remove final keyword before method getDetails."""
Remove static keyword before final variable name.
"""Now, we will learn whether constructor can be declared as final or not."""
"""For that, we will again create a constructor. So, instead of static we will type: Employee parentheses."""
Add final keyword before the constructor.
Save and run the program.
We get error: Illegal modifier for the constructor in type Employee.
"""This is because, constructor cannot be final since constructors cannot  be inherited."""
We will remove the final keyword before the constructor.
"""Now, we will learn about final class."""
Add final keyword before the class Employee to make it final.
We get  error: The method setEmail is undefined for the type Manager.
"""To know the actual error, let's come to TestEmployee class and comment the lines"""
"""manager.setEmail(""""abc@gmail.com""""); manager.setDepartment(""""Accounts"""");"""
Save the class and run the program.
The actual error is The type manager cannot subclass the final class Employee.
"""Here, Manager class extends Employee class."""
"""So, let's come back to Employee class and remove the final keyword. Save the class."""
"""Come to the TestEmployee class. Uncomment the lines manager.setEmail(""""abc@gmail.com""""); manager.setDepartment(""""Accounts"""");"""
Save the class and run the program.
We got the desired output.
"""Now let's summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt:  When to invoke final keyword , What are final variables, final methods and final classes."""
"""As an assignment, Repeat the steps of Using final keyword tutorial for the Bike and Vehicle class which we used in the previous tutorial."""
Write down the classes in Java that are final classes.
Watch the video available at the following link.  It summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Relational Operators in C and C++.
"""Relational operators like,"""
Less than: e.g.  a < b
Greater than: e.g. a > b
Less than or equal to: e.g.  a <= b
Greater than or equal to: e.g. a >= b
Equal to: e.g. a == b
Not equal to: e.g. a != b
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 11.10 as the operating system, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 in Ubuntu."
Let us begin with an introduction.
Relational operators are used to compare integer and floating point numbers.
Expressions using relational operators return 0 for false and 1 for true.
Now I will demonstrate the relational operators with the help of a C program.
I have already made the program.
"""So, I'll open the editor and explain the code."""
"""First, we declare two variables a and b."""
This printf statement prompts the user to enter the values of a and b.
This scanf statement takes input for the variables a and b.
Now we have the greater than (>) operator.
This operator compares the two operands on either side of the operator.
It returns True if a is greater than b.
This printf statement is executed if the above condition is true.
If the above condition is false then it is skipped.
The control then jumps to the next statement.
We now have the less than (<) operator.
This too compares the operands.
It returns true when a is less than b.
This printf statement is executed if the above condition is true.
It is skipped otherwise.
Let's execute the code till here.
First comment out the following.
Type /* (slash asterisk) */  (asterisk slash).
I have saved my file as relational.c.
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""To compile, type the following on the terminal gcc space  relational dot c space -o space rel."""
"""To execute,  type ./rel (dot slash rel). Press Enter."""
I enter a as 8 and b as 3.
The output is displayed: 8 is greater than 3.
You can try executing this code with different values of a and b.
Coming back to  the code.
Delete the comment from here and  put it here.
Now we have the less than or equal to (<=) operator.
This operator compares the two operands on either side of the operator.
It returns true if a is less than or equal to b.
This printf statement is executed if the above condition is true.
If the above condition is false then it is skipped.
The control then jumps to the next statement.
Next comes the greater than or equal to (>=) operator.
It compares a and b and  returns  true if a is greater than or equal to b.
If the condition is true then this printf statement will be executed.
Now let's execute the code till here.
Switch back to the terminal.
Compile and execute as before.
I enter a as 8 and b as 3.
The output is displayed: 8 is greater than or equal to 3
Now  Coming back to rest of the code.
Delete the multiline comments from here and here.
We now have the equal to operator.
It is denoted by double equal signs (==).
This operator returns true when both operands are equal to one another.
This printf statement executes when a is equal to b.
"""If not, the control then jumps on to the next statement."""
"""Similarly, we have the not equal to operator."""
This operator returns true when the operands are not equal to one another.
This printf statement will execute when a is not equal to b.
Coming to the end of the program. return 0;
Compile and execute as before.
Enter a as 8 and b as 3.
The output is displayed on the screen:
8 is not equal to 3
"""So, we see how the relational operators work."""
Try executing this code with different set of inputs.
"""Now, writing a similar program in C++ is quite easy."""
There are a few differences in the syntax.
I have already made the code in C++.
Here  is the code for relational operators in C++.
Notice that the header is different.
Also we have the using statement here.
The output statement in C++ is cout.
And the input statement in C++ is cin.
"""So, apart from these differences, the two codes are very similar."""
Please make sure the file is saved with the extension .cpp.
I have saved my file as relational.cpp.
Let's compile the code.
Open the terminal and type g++ relational.cpp space minus o space rel1
"""To  execute, type  ./rel1 (dot slash rel1), press Enter."""
I enter a as 8 and b as 3.
The output is displayed:
We see that the output is same as  the one in  C program.
Now let us see an error which we can come across.
Come back to the program.
Suppose here we replace the 'double equal to' sign with the 'single equal to'.
Come back to the terminal.
Compile and execute as before.
Here we see it is showing 3 is equal to 3.
Come back to our program.
This is because here we have an assignment operator.
So value of b is assigned to a.
"""Now, let us fix this error."""
Type an equal to sign.
Switch back to  the terminal.
Compile and execute as before.
The output is now correct.
Let's summarize the tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt"""
relational operators like:
Less than:  e.g. a <  b
Greater than: e.g. a>b
Less than or equal to:  e.g. a<=b
Greater than or equal to: e.g. a>=b
Equal to: e.g. a==b
Not equal to: e.g. a!=b
As an assignment: Write a program that takes the marks of three students as input. Compare the marks to see which student has scored the highest. Check also if two or more students have scored equal marks.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
"""My Name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""In the beginning, I will do something that I always forget to mention."""
I always forget to save the image before doing anything to it.
"""So I go to File, Save as and save this as"""
"""""""comic.xcf""""."""
‘xcf’ is the Gimp native file format and it keeps all the layers information in the file.
"""Never save anything in Gimp as JPEG or 'tif' or so, if you want to work further with it."""
"""You can export from there to every format you want to but for anything you want to do further work with, use 'XCF'."""
"""So, what to do? 1st thing I have to clear up this image a bit."""
"""There are two problems here. First, the guy behind me"""
"""and second is this clutter, below here."""
"""This statue here is very well placed and I think, it is one of the corner points of this image."""
"""So, let me first take away this stuff here."""
So I zoom into the image and select the Pen Tool.
This is best done by Cloning Tool and I don’t have to work very precise here because all this little stuff will vanish in the final image.
So I select the Clone tool and change the size of the Brush.
"""Now, I press Ctrl and click to get a starting point and now I simply start to paint."""
"""But, before starting that I change the Overlay mode to Normal mode, Opacity to 100 and now let’s start painting."""
"""Image gets a little bit cloudy, so I select another brush to paint."""
And now I go here to the border and paint.
"""So, the guy is gone."""
That leaves the clutter here.
I want to keep the flower pot here but this stuff here has to go.
I will take care of this border of the flower pot in a moment.
"""If I would keep this image in this way, you would see the traces of cloning but they will vanish when I switch on the comic mode."""
"""So, now let's do a bit about the flower pot here."""
"""I think, I should clone from this point."""
It doesn't look very convincing in this zoom step but I think it will work.
The comic image basically consists of three parts.
"""First, there are the black patches or dark patches with no colours which give structure to the image."""
Then there are the lines which define forms and items in the image.
And then there is colour and we will start as in the tutorial with the patches.
"""And for that,"""
I double this layer and call it ink.
I select the Threshold tool and click into the image and pull the info. window into the image.
"""You see here, the image is black and white."""
This tool divides the image into black and white.
"""If the pixel is lighter than, at the moment, 82 then the combination of average value of red, green and blue is white."""
And if the level is below 82 it becomes black.
Now we face the first problem here.
"""When I draw this slider around, the effect is very dark."""
"""This value here, 129, would be nice for the left part of my face, the shoulder and for the statue."""
This would be nice for the eyes here
and this for other eye.
Now I have to use different ink layer for this image.
"""So, let's start from the lighter side, like this one here and go back into the image to 100%."""
I double this here and select the Threshold tool and pull this slider down.
But before that I have to make the top layer invisible.
I think this value is good for this part of the face.
I make a copy of this layer and make it visible and now I am working on this layer.
I have to look for the middle terms here.
"""This part of the face, I think this works quite good; so I look around in the image."""
The statue is fine too.
This image has a good definition here and near my hand the line is invisible and that is called optical illusion.
I think this is fine and it should be in the image.
"""Now, I select the Threshold tool, make the line here visible and look at the bright parts to get little bit of definition. So I slide this up."""
This looks better.
Now I have 3 copies of my ink layer.
First is ink light .
Top layer is ink dark.
And let's name the middle layer simply ink.
Now let's look at the 3 layers and decide which one is to use mostly.
I think ink layer is a good base because this is too light and this is too dark.
"""So, I put this layer in the bottom and I add a layer mask to the dark layer and the light layer."""
I add a layer mask in black which is fully transparent.
"""So, everything here gets invisible."""
"""When I draw white on this layer mask of the light layer, the image will be revealed in it."""
"""So, I select the Brush tool here with Normal mode and Opacity 100%."""
"""I think, I shall use a hard brush and the Pressure sensitivity should be the Size. So, when I press the brush on the surface, the dot will be  larger."""
My foreground colour is white.
So let's start.
I think the left part of the face should be brightened.
I press 1 to zoom into the image.
"""I think this brush is too small,  so I scale this a bit up."""
That looks better.
But perhaps it is too bright.
This has to be either black or white.
"""So, I switch the colours with ‘X’ key and paint this over again, here."""
"""But I think, I can leave this out here and put the next layer above that."""
"""Now, we are more concerned about the areas and about the structure. So, I should forget about the lines and just look at the structure here."""
Simply leave it as it is.
I can add another layer easily and now I paint for the dark parts with the white colour.
Let's see if I can reveal here a little bit.
I think this is too much.
I want to make the face a bit darker.
And here also.
I think that is too dark.
"""Here, there is some work still to be done but I will leave it to this here and look at it after I am done with the next step with the lines and then I can adjust here."""
This has to be brightened up.
"""So, we will look at the edit there."""
"""In this step, I have to add some lines and this can be done by doubling the Background layer and putting it on top and naming it lines."""
The lines are the edges between different colours.
"""So, I go to Filters, then we have Edge-detect and here I have Difference of Gaussian Edge Detect."""
"""The relevant slider is the Radius and if you decrease the number, the lines get finer."""
"""If you increase the number, the lines get wider and you get more of the details in the image."""
I would prefer something around 10 but I can go to 30 and then decide where exactly I should stop.
"""When I go to 30, I don't get the edges but areas and 12 would give this here."""
And I think I will settle at 10.
I set the Layer mode of this layer to Multiply and for the colour rising I will later need to reduce the white in the image.
Now let's checkout if we have got this right up to now.
"""So, I will switch the lines layer on and off and you see here there is some definition when the lines layer is on."""
And now I de-select the dark ink layer and keep the light ink layer.
The structure that I wanted to have in with my dark ink layer is visible in the lines layer.
"""So, I will leave the dark ink layer switched off."""
I don't think there is a need to combine these layers here.
I will leave it as it is so that I can change something and it will be in the final image.
"""Next step, as I said, I have to reduce the White channel here and it can be done with the Levels tool and I reduce the level up to 240."""
"""When I switch off this layer, you can see that I have a gray background and little bit of colour information in here."""
"""For getting the colour in the image, I copy the Background layer and name it colour and put it on the top and set the layer mode to Colour."""
"""But it doesn't look good, so I should change the mode."""
The image has got little bit of colour in here.
"""But I want more saturation, so again I make the copy of Background layer and name it saturation."""
I set the layer mode to Saturation.
I think this Saturation mode already works and the effects are very good.
There should have been more flatness in the colour and the hand is not looking comic.
I will look where this comes from.
"""So, I can now start to play with these sliders."""
"""Going down with Saturation gets little bit flatter and looks more like water colours. So, this is a strange effect."""
Now I can start to play with the layers here.
"""So, I switch off the lines layer and you see here that this is not the effect from the lines but from colour and saturation."""
Now I can make some adjustments because I still have the layers here.
"""I want to lighten the face, so I select my ink light layer, select a brush with white foreground colour."""
I zoom into the image.
"""Reduce the size of the brush and scale it a bit and now I start to paint the eye, here."""
That's too much.
Now I paint in this part.
This is too much.
"""You can imagine, there can be lot of modifications in here you can make in the image by changing these areas here."""
This is OK.
You can do a lot of changes here and I don't know if I am on the right track.
But I like it up to now.
Let’s see what else we can do.
"""First thing is, we can use a different layer than the lines."""
"""So, I switch off the lines and I get very strange colours because now I have again a white background."""
So add another layer here and set it to white and use Multiply mode and fill it with 240 grey.
Now I have got nearly the same image as with my lines here.
Let me switch them on.
I have the lines information coming out but this comic effect is still there and I can look what’s better.
Let's try some different tricks.
I double the colour and the saturation layers and do something with them.
"""Here, I just try to get the details out of the image."""
"""So, go to Filters >> Blur and Gaussian Blur."""
"""And here, I choose a value which gives me a nice effect."""
You see that the colours have got little bit smoother.
"""So, let's do this on the saturation copy also."""
"""Go to Filters >> Repeat """"Guassian Blur"""" ."""
And now I have really flat image with flat colours.
"""So, I switch on the original colour and I get a strange effect here."""
Let's rename these layers as saturation blurred and the colour blurred.
"""If I combine the blurred saturation with the unblurred colour, I get some colours here which look quite a bit strange."""
"""I would like it if it was not especially on the nose, here."""
"""So, switching this back on and I have this effect here."""
"""You can imagine if you reduce the blurring, you get sharp details."""
This is a real play ground.
"""You have a lot of possibilities here like how to do this, what to do, what to tinker with."""
It's really fun to do this.
The author of the original tutorial has done a tremendous job.
I am not so happy with both versions of this image.
"""I like the structure here and the flower, the statue and the pot here."""
"""I don’t like all the details near the hand and in the face, this could be little bit more flat."""
"""In the blurred on, I like the details in the face and near the hand but I don’t like the flower which is completely blurred away."""
"""So, now I can combine the two images and I will start with colour blurred because I like the over all appearance of this more than of the saturation blurred."""
"""But I switch on all the layers and add layer mask to saturation blurred and colour blurred and I add a Black layer mask, fully transparent."""
"""And now I'll start working on saturation layer mask. So, I select white as my foreground colour and select the Paintbrush here."""
Now I start painting.
I just paint over the parts where I want to have little bit more flatness in the image.
This will look a bit strange because now I have the colour layer switched on.
"""So now, I select everything by pressing Shift+ctrl+A and copy it by Ctrl + C, go into the image and press Ctrl + V and click on insert this Floating Selection and with Ctrl + H or with the anchor layer I hav"
"""So, you can copy these layer masks too and I think I will leave this image here."""
I think it’s so quite nice example and in the end I play a bit with these sliders.
Lets recap this.
You first copy the image layer and make  an inked  image with threshold tool.
Look for areas which you want to have black or very dark.
Then you copy the base image again and make a line layer with the edge detect filter and then you set the layer mode to Multiply.
"""In this layer, you reduce the white to a gray about 240 with the Levels tool."""
Then you copy again the base image and make a colour layer.
Set the colour mode to Colour.
And finally you copy the base layer last time and make a saturation layer and here you set the layer mode to Saturation and now you play with the opacity of the different layers or at some layers.
Just play around. The results are well mixed but some are stunning.

Hi everybody.Welcome to the  tutorial on introduction to Developing Web Applications on the Netbeans IDE.
We assume that you have the basic working knowledge of Netbeans.
"""If not, please visit the Spoken Tutorial website for relevant tutorials on Netbeans."""
"""Having viewed the first tutorial, you would already be familiar"""
with the installation and interface of Netbeans.
The previous tutorial also teaches you how to create a new project.
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System Ubuntu version 11.04 and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1."""
This tutorial will take you through the basics of using Netbeans  to develop web applications.
We will see - Setting up a web-application project
Creating and editing web-applications source files
Creating a java package and a java source file
Generating the Getter and Setter methods
Editing the default Java Server Pages file
Creating a JavaServer pages file and
finally running our web-application project.
"""To follow this tutorial, you will need: * the Netbeans IDE"""
The Java Development Kit (JDK) version 6
The GlassFish Server Open Source Edition.
All the above can be downloaded in a single bundle from the link shown on the screen.
"""This tutorial demonstrates how to create a simple web application,"""
"""deploy it to a server,"""
and view its presentation in a browser.
"""The application employs (JSP)  Java Server Pages, to ask you, to input your name."""
It then uses JavaBeans component to persist the name during the HTTP session
and then retrieves the  output on a second JSP page.
Let us now move to Netbeans and create our web-application project.
"""From the File menu, choose New Project."""
"""Under Categories, select Java Web."""
"""Under Projects, select Web Application and click Next."""
"""Give your project a name. I will name my project as """"HelloWeb""""."""
Specify the Project Location to any directory on your computer.
Click Next.
The Server and Settings panel opens.
Select the version of Java you want to use with your application.
"""And, select the server, you want to deploy your application to."""
"""In the Frameworks panel,"""
click Finish to create the project.
The IDE creates the HelloWeb project folder.
This folder contains all of your sources and project metadata.
"""The welcome page- index.jsp, opens in the Source Editor in the main window."""
"""You can view the project's file structure in the Files window on the left, here,"""
and it's logical structure in the Projects window.
Creating and editing source files is the most important function that the IDE serves.
"""Now in the Projects window, expand the Source Packages node."""
"""Note that the Source Packages node contains only  an empty """"default package"""" node."""
Right-click on the Source Packages  and choose New > Java Class.
"""Give your class a name. I will name the class as """"NameHandler"""""""
"""and in the Package combo-box, let me type: """"org.mypackage.hello"""""""
and click Finish.
The NameHandler.java file opens in the Source editor.
"""Now, let's declare a String variable directly below the class declaration."""
I will declare a string variable 'String name' and
I will also add a constructor public NameHandler() to the class.
"""Now, let me also  add name = null; within the constructor."""
Let us next generate the Getter and Setter Methods.
"""Right-click the name field in the Source Editor, choose Refactor  and  Encapsulate Fields  from the contextual menu."""
"""Refactoring is a disciplined technique for improving the structure of the existing code, without changing the observable behavior."""
"""In short, you can change the structure of the code without changing the behavior."""
"""With Refactoring, you can easily move fields, methods or classes around, without breaking things."""
Let's move back to the IDE.
"""The Encapsulate Fields dialog-box opens, listing the name field."""
"""Notice that the Fields Visibility is  set to """"private"""""""
"""and the Accessors Visibility is set to """"public"""", by default,"""
indicating that the access modifier for the class variables will be specified as private
whereas the getter and setter methods will be generated with 'public' modifiers respectively.
Click on Refactor.
The Getter and Setter methods are generated for the name field.
"""The modifier for the class variable is set to """"private"""" whereas the  getter and setter methods are generated with """"public"""" modifier."""
Your java class should finally look like this.
Let us next edit the Default JavaServer Pages File.
"""Let us refocus the 'index.jsp' file by clicking its tab, displayed at the top of the Source editor."""
"""Now, let us open the Palette manager by going to the Tools menu > Palette and click on HTML/JSP code clips."""
The Palette manager opens.
"""In the palette manager, expand the HTML Forms option."""
Select the Form item.
"""Drag it and drop it to a point after the h1 tags, in your Source Editor."""
The Insert Form dialog-box opens.
Let us specify the values as being shown on the screen:
"""the Action as  """"response.jsp"""","""
"""the Method as """"GET""""."""
"""And, let's  give our form a name as """"Name Input Form""""."""
Click OK.
An HTML form is added to the 'index.jsp' file.
"""Now, from the Palette manager, select a Text Input item, drag it and drop it to a point just before the closing form tags."""
"""In the Insert Text Input dialog-box, specify the Name as """"name""""."""
Leave the Type at text
and click on OK.
A HTML input tag is now added between the form tags.
Let us delete the empty 'value' attribute from the input tag.
"""Now, from the palette, select the Button item."""
"""Drag it and drop it to the point, before the closing form tag."""
"""Specify the Label as """"OK"""","""
"""the Type as """"submit"""""""
and click on OK again.
An HTML button is now added to a  form tags.
"""Infront of the first input tag, let us enter the text """"Enter your name""""."""
"""And, let us  change the default text between the h1  tags."""
"""We will change the text to """"Entry form""""."""
"""Now, right-click. Let me close the palette manager, for now."""
Right-click within your Source Editor.
Select the Format option to tidy the format of your code.
Your 'index.jsp' file should now look like this.
Let us next create a JavaServer Pages file.
"""In the Projects window, right-click on the HelloWeb project node, choose New > JSP."""
The New JSP file wizard opens.
"""Name the file as """"response"""" and click on Finish."""
"""Notice that a 'response.jsp' file node displays in the Projects window, beneath the index.jsp file"""
and the new file opens in the Source Editor.
Open the Palette manager again.
"""Now, expand the JSP option."""
"""Select a Use Bean item, drag it and drop it to a point just below the body tag."""
The Insert Use Bean dialog opens.
Specify the values as-
"""the ID as mybean,"""
"""the Class as """"org.mypackage.hello.NameHandler""""."""
Set the Scope as session
and click on OK.
Notice that a jsp:useBean tag is added beneath the body tag.
JavaBeans are reusable software components for Java.
They are used to encapsulate many objects into a single object
so that they can be passed around as a single bean object instead of multiple individual objects.
"""Now, from the Palette manager, select a Set Bean property item, drag it and drop it  to a point just before the h1 tags"""
"""Here, in the jsp:setProperty tag that appears, delete the empty """"value"""" attribute"""
"""and set the name attribute to """"mybean"""" and the Property to """"name""""."""
"""Now, in between the h1 tags, let us change the text to Hello comma space and an exclamation mark."""
"""Now, from the Palette manager, select a Get Bean property  item. Drag it and drop it after the """"Hello"""" text  in between the h1 tags."""
"""In the Get Bean Property item,"""
"""set the Bean Name to """"mybean"""""""
"""and the Property Name to """"name""""."""
Click on OK.
Notice that jsp:getProperty tag is now added between the h1 tags.
"""Right-click within the Source Editor again. Click on  Format to tidy the format of your code, if required."""
The next step is to run our Web Application Project.
Let me close the Palette manager.
"""In the Projects window, right-click the """"HelloWeb"""" project node and choose the Run option."""
You can also click the Run option from the toolbar or press F6 key on your keyboard to run your Project.
I will select the button on the toolbar to run my Project.
"""When you run a Web application, the IDE builds and compiles the application code,"""
launches the server and deploys the application to the server
and finally displays the application in a browser window.
"""To view these processes, you can open the output window from the Window menu and select the Output option."""
You can see that your application has been  built successfully.
The 'index.jsp' page opens in your default browser.
Let me run the project again.
Here it is! It opens in your default browser.
Note that the browser window may sometimes open before the IDE displays the server output.
"""Now, let us enter the name in the text-box, in the browser."""
For e.g. Ubuntu and click on OK.
"""The 'response.jsp' page displays, providing you with a simple greeting."""
"""Now, to the assignment part-"""
"""As an extension to the web-application project, insert two more text fields, that is, totally three input text fields in your application."""
Use the JavaBeans component to set the bean property and
view its presentation in the browser.
"""And finally, retrieve the output on the second JSP page."""
I have already constructed my assignment.
Let me open my assignment and run it in the  IDE.
I am presented with 3 input text fields.
Let me enter the details and click on OK.
I should be presented with an output like this.
"""If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch the videos."""

Welcome to this tutorial on Edit molecules.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to-  add and delete atoms,"""
"""add and delete bonds,"""
"""rotate bonds,"""
"""change length of the bond,"""
"""change hydrogen to methyl group,"""
"""copy, paste and join structures."""
"""Here I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS version. 14.04, Avogadro version 1.1.1."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with:  Avogadro  interface."""
Here I will show how to open Avogadro  using the Terminal.
"""To open the terminal, press CTRL, ALT and T keys simultaneously."""
Type avogadro at the prompt and press Enter.
Avogadro application window opens.
"""For demonstration, I will display a molecule of n-butane from the Fragment library."""
Click on Build menu. Navigate to Insert->Fragment
Insert fragment dialog box appears.
"""From the list of fragments, double click on alkanes folder to open."""
Select butane.cml from the drop down that appears.
Click on Insert button. Click on X to close Insert Fragment dialog box.
"""Butane molecule, highlighted in blue color, appears on the Panel."""
"""To remove the highlighting, Press Ctrl, Shift and A keys simultaneously."""
Rotate the structure using Navigation tool to get proper alignment.
We will now learn how to add atoms to the molecule.
Click on Draw tool icon on the tool bar.
Click on end Carbon atom and drag on the Panel.
A carbon atom with required hydrogens get added.
We now have a molecule of pentane on Panel.
"""Similarly, you can add atoms using Draw tool to make a series of alkanes."""
Open a new window. Draw propane using Draw tool.
Let us delete the end Carbon atom with hydrogens to get a molecule of Ethane.
"""To delete atoms, click on the Selection tool icon on the tool bar."""
Click and drag over the end Carbon atom to make the selection.
Selected atoms appear blue in color.
"""Press Backspace to delete. Alternatively, you can use clear option in Edit menu."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on How to close a Budget.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn the steps involved in closing a Budget."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04 and Koha version 16.05."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have Koha installed on your system."""
"""And, you should have Admin access in Koha."""
Please refer to the Koha Spoken Tutorial series on this website for more details.
Let’s learn how to close a Budget.
"""Before we start, please note: closing of a Budget is done to move the un-received orders and"""
the required unspent funds
from an old Budget to a new Budget.
From the previous Budget i.e. Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I
to a new Budget i.e. Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018 Phase II
"""Please note- Before closing a Budget, it is advisable to duplicate the immediate previous year's Budget."""
"""To do so, the same fund structures of the previous Budget must exist in the new Budget."""
"""For closing a Budget, do the following: Login with the Superlibrarian username and password."""
"""On the Koha Home page, click on Acquisitions."""
"""From the options on the left side, click on Budgets."""
"""On Budgets administration page, under the tab Active Budgets, locate the respective Budget."""
"""In my case, Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I."""

"""When 'Close' is selected, a new page opens up."""
It says - The unreceived orders from the following funds will be moved.
"""On the same page, we have Select a Budget."""
"""From the drop-down, select the Budget wherein you want to move your unreceived orders."""
I will select Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018 Phase II. The same Fund details need to be created in the Duplicate Budget.
This will enable us to move the unspent Budget there.
Next is 'Move remaining unspent funds'.
Clicking on this will move the unspent amounts to the new Budget.
Do so if you wish to add the unspent amount of the immediate previous year to the new Budget. I will leave this box blank.
"""After all details are filled, click on Move unreceived orders button at the bottom of the page."""
A dialog-box appears with the following message:
"""You have chosen to move all unreceived orders from 'Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I' to 'Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018, Phase II'."""
This action cannot be reversed. Do you wish to continue?.
"""It is important to remember that once completed, you cannot undo this process."""
Click on OK under the dialog-box.
A new page opens. Report after moving unreceived orders from Budget Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I (01/04/2016 - 31/03/2017) to Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018 Phase II (01/04/2017 - 31/03/2018).
This page will display the Order numbers with details having Moved.
"""With this, we have closed the financial year's Budget."""
"""And, we can now move on to create the next year's Budget."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on do-while Loop in java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn about: do-while loop and how to use it"""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10 JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of while loop in java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown."""
Here is the structure for  do-while loop.
Notice that it is similar to a while loop.
It has two parts.
First is the loop running condition. And the second is the loop variable.
The only difference is that the condition is written after the do block.
"""And so, the condition is checked after the execution of the statements inside the do block."""
"""Now, let us see an example."""
Switch to eclipse.
Here we have Eclipse IDE and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
We have created a class DoWhileDemo and added the main method to it.
We are going to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a do-while loop.
Type:
int n equal to 1;.
'n' is going to be the loop variable.
Then type: do
open   and close  braces
Inside the braces System.out.println(n);
We shall print the value of 'n' and then increment it. n equal to  n plus 1;
And we do this as long as
n is less than or equal to 10.
"""So, outside the braces, type: while in parentheses n less than or equal to 10."""
and close the do-while using a semicolon.
Let us see the code in action.
Save and Run.
We see that the numbers from 1 to 10 are printed.
"""Now, let us understand how the code is executed."""
"""First, the value 1 is printed and then 'n' becomes 2."""
"""And then, the condition is checked."""
"""since it is true, again 2 is printed and 'n' becomes 3."""
And so on till all the 10 numbers are printed and the value of 'n' becomes 11.
"""When n = 11, the condition fails and the loop stops."""
"""Now, let us print numbers from 50 to 40 in decreasing order."""
"""So, we start with 50."""
"""So, change n = 1 to n = 50."""
"""Since we are looping from a bigger number to a smaller number, we decrement the loop variable."""
"""So, change n = n + 1 to n = n - 1."""
We loop as long as 'n' is greater than or equal to 40.
"""So, change the condition to n >= 40."""
Let us look at the output.
Save and Run.
"""As we can see, the numbers from 50 to 40 are printed."""
Now let us try a different logic using the do-while loop.
"""Given a number, we shall find out if it is a perfect square or not."""
First clear the main method.
"""Then, type int n = 25;"""
We shall see if the value in 'n' is a perfect square or not.
Then type int x = 0;
We shall use 'x' to store the square root of the number if it is a perfect square.
Then type do
Open and close braces.
"""Inside the braces, x equal to x  plus  1;"""
and outside the braces
while in parentheses x into x is less than n
And close the do-while using a semi-colon.
"""As long as x into x is less than n, we keep incrementing the value of 'x'."""
"""So, when the loop stops the reverse of this condition will be true."""
"""Which means, either 'x into x' must be equal to 'n'"""
or it  must be greater than 'n'.
"""If x into x is equal to n, the number is a perfect square."""
"""If it is not equal to 'n', the number is not a perfect square."""
"""So finally, we print the condition."""
System.out.println (x * x == n);
Let us see the code in action.
"""Save and Run.  As we can see, the output is true."""
Let us try with another perfect square.
Change n = 25 to n = 49.
We see that we get a true again .
Let us try with a number which is not a perfect square.
Change 49 to 23. Save and Run and
we get a false as expected.
"""Now, let us see what happens when the value of 'n' is 0."""
"""Change n = 23 to n = 0. Since 0 is not a natural number, we must get a false."""
Let us run the code.
We see that we get false as expected.
This happens because even before the condition
"""x into x is less than n  is checked, the value of 'x' is incremented and it becomes 1."""
The loop condition fails and the loop does not run.
"""This way, by using a do-while loop, we make sure that 0 is not considered as a perfect square."""
"""This way, a do-while loop is used for solving a range of problems."""
"""Specially, when the loop must run at least once."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about"""
the do-while loop and how to use it.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial, solve the following problem."""
"""Given a binary number, find out its decimal equivalent. Example: 11010 => 26"""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Setting Pop-up and Image options in Mozilla Firefox.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn: * How to set Pop-up and image preferences."""
Customize Toolbar.
Pop-up windows or pop-ups are windows that appear automatically without your permission.
They vary in size but usually don't cover the whole screen.
Some pop-ups open on top of the current Firefox window while others appear underneath Firefox (pop-unders).
Pop-ups can be quite irritating and that’s why we want to disable them.
"""In this tutorial, we are using Firefox version 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04."""
Let us open a Firefox browser.
"""In the URL bar, let us type ‘w w w dot pop up test dot com’."""
Press the Enter key.
This site shows you what a pop-up is.
Click on the link that says ‘Multi-PopUp Test’.
You will see 6 pop-ups.
Click on Back.
2 more pop-ups appear. See how irritating they are?
Firefox allows you to control both pop-ups and pop-unders.  This is done by clicking on Edit and then Preferences.
"""Windows users, please click on Tools and then on Options."""
"""In the Preferences window, click on the Content tab."""
"""The Block pop-up windows option is already turned on, by default."""
"""If not, then you need to check it."""
"""So, you don't have to worry about enabling it to prevent pop-ups from appearing in Firefox."""
Now you can close the Firefox Preference window by clicking on the Close button.
You can also choose exceptions.
Exceptions are sites whose pop-ups are acceptable to you.
Click on Edit and then Preferences.
"""Windows users, please click on Tools and then on Options."""
"""In order to add exceptions, click on the Exceptions button next to the field Block pop-up windows."""
This opens up a dialog box.
"""In the Address of website field, type: ‘w w w dot google dot com’."""
Click on the Allow button.
Click Close to close the dialog box.
Click Close to close the Preferences dialog box.
Now pop-ups will be disallowed from all sites except from 'google.com'.
"""Now in the URL bar, type: ‘w w w dot pop up test dot com’ and press Enter."""
Click on the link 'Multi-PopUp Test'.
Not a single pop-up has appeared.
Your pop-up blocker is effective!
Images take time and bandwidth to download.
Mozilla Firefox has an option to selectively stop the downloading of images.
Click on Edit and then Preferences.
"""In the Preferences dialog box, choose the Content tab."""
Disable the check-box for Load images automatically.
Click on Close to close the dialog box.
"""Now, in the Search bar, let us type """"Flowers"""" and press the Enter key."""
"""From the 'google' home page, click on Images."""
click on the first image link that appears.
You see that the image does not load.
Mozilla Firefox offers a number of options to customize the toolbars.
"""Let’s say we want to hide any toolbar. For example, the Menu bar."""
Right-click on an empty section of the Menu bar.
And uncheck it. That's it!
To view the the Menu bar again right-click on an empty section of the toolbar again.
Now check the Menu bar option.
Firefox offers advanced options to customize the toolbars. Let's look at some.
Let us add an icon to the Toolbar which will allow us to print a web-page with a single click.
Right-click on an empty section of the Toolbar.
Click on Customize.
The Customize Toolbar dialog box appears.
"""Within the dialog box, you can see the Print icon."""
Drag the icon onto the Toolbar.
Close the dialog box by clicking on Done.
Click on the Print icon in the Toolbar.
This brings up the Print dialog box.
We will not be printing now.
"""So, click on Cancel to close the dialog box."""
You can also add or remove toolbars.
"""To do so, right-click on the Toolbar and select Customize."""
Click on Add New Toolbar button.
Enter a name for the new toolbar. Let’s name it Sample Toolbar.
Click on OK button.
"""Now drag and drop an icon, say Downloads, onto the Sample Toolbar."""
Notice the new Toolbar in the browser.
"""To remove a toolbar, click on Restore Default Set button."""
"""In order to maximize the contents area, we can reduce the size of the icons."""
"""Check on the check-box titled """"Use Small icons""""."""
Click Done to close the dialog box.
We see that the size of the icons has become smaller.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt how to: Set Pop-up and Image preferences."""
Customize Toolbar.
Here is an assignment for you.
Open a new Mozilla Firefox window. Block all the pop-ups except those from 'www.yahoo.com'. Insert a bookmarks toolbar.

Locate the two blank boxes adjacent to 650 question mark.
Type 1 in the first blank box.
Note that  1 is the indicator for Primary (Level of subject).
Type 0 in the second blank box.
Note that 0 is the indicator for Library of Congress Subject Headings (Thesaurus).
"""In the sub-field ‘a’ Topical term or geographic name entry element, type subject heading."""
I will type: Industrial Microbiology.
"""In case, more than one keyword has to be added then, as explained earlier, click on the small button Repeat this Tag."""
A duplicate field 650 opens.
Type 2 in the first blank box.
Note that 2 is the indicator for Secondary (Level of Subject).
Keep 0 in the second blank box as it is.
Note that 0 is the indicator for Library of Congress Subject Headings (Thesaurus).
"""In the sub-field ‘a’ Topical term or geographic name entry element, enter the keyword as Bacteria."""
"""Lastly, go to the top, from the tabs 0 to 9 and click on the tab 9 ."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Users in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to: add a user, edit a user’s profile, upload users in bulk."""
"""This tutorial is recorded using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04, Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30 Moodle 3.3  and  Firefox web browser.  You can use any web browser of your choice."""
"""Learners of this tutorial should have some courses created on their Moodle website. If not, please refer to the previous Moodle tutorials on this website."""
"""Switch to the browser and login to your Moodle website, using your admin username and password."""
"""Now, we will learn how to create a new user in Moodle."""
"""In the Navigation block, click on Site Administration and then on the Users tab."""
Click on Add a new user option.
I will enter the username as adminuser2.
Scroll down to the New Password field. Click on the link Click to enter text.
Please note- the password must follow the rules as shown here.
I will enter Spokentutorial1@ as my password.
Click on the checkbox Force password change.
This forces the new user to change his/her password when he/she logs in for the first time.
Enter rest of the details as per your preference as shown here.
"""In the Email display, note that I have selected Allow everyone to see my email address. This is because I am going to make this user as an admin user later."""
But this is best avoided for other users like teachers and students.
We will leave the City/Town field as blank for now.  We will update this later when we edit this user.
Then select country and timezone as shown here.
Let all the remaining fields be set to default.
Then scroll down and click on Create user button.
We now have 2 users. Click on the System Admin2 user which we created just now.
We can edit this user’s profile by clicking on the Edit Profile link on the right. Let us enter Mumbai in the City/Town text-box.
"""Then scroll down and click Update profile button. Likewise, we can edit any detail for any user."""
Look at the 3 icons to the right of this new user. Hover over them to see what each of them does.
"""The delete icon will delete the user. Please note: Deleting a user will delete all the user data, including his/ her course registrations, grades etc.  So, this option should be used with extreme caution."""
The eye icon will suspend the user. Suspending a user would mean deactivating his/her account.
"""So, the user will no longer be able to login, but his/ her registrations, grades, etc. are all kept intact."""
This is a better thing to do rather than deleting the user.
It saves the records for future purposes and you can activate the user back whenever you want to.
Next is the gear icon. This will take us to the Edit profile page.
Note that delete and suspend icons are not shown next to the Admin User.
This is because the main system administrator can never be deleted or deactivated.
"""Now, let us learn to add users in bulk, that is, in one go."""
"""For this, we have to upload a file with certain data in a particular format. The accepted file type is CSV."""
I’ll open the user-details-upoad.csv file which I have already created for demonstration.
I’m using LibreOffice Calc which is the spreadsheet component of LibreOffice Suite.
"""This file has the following columns: username, password, firstname, lastname, email. These 5 fields are mandatory fields."""
"""There are some more fields here which are optional: institution, department, phone1, address, course1, role1."""
Note that the field titles have to be exactly as written in this spreadsheet i.e. in lowercase. Otherwise the upload will throw an error.
"""If we have only one course in which to enroll the user, we will suffix 1 in the fields title."""
"""If there are more courses you want to enroll the users to, add more columns with course2, role2, etc."""
Please note: you should input Course short name in the course1 field and Role short name in the role1 field.
The Role short name for a student is student and for a teacher is editingteacher.
"""We will have 3 users in this CSV file: System Admin2 user which has already been created manually, one user with only 5 mandatory fields to show that other fields are optional and  one user with all details."
This CSV file is available in the Code files section of this tutorial.  You can download and use it.
The Additional Reading Material of this tutorial has more information about the CSV file creation.
Now let’s go back to the browser window.
Click on Site Administration in the Navigation block.
"""Then click on the Users tab. In the Accounts section, click on Upload Users."""
Click on Choose a file button. A new pop-up window opens with the title File picker.
"""Click on Upload a file link in the left menu, if the pop-up window is not on that link already."""
Click on Browse / Choose a file button whichever appears on your interface. Browse to the saved folder and select the CSV file.
We will let all the other fields remain as default.
"""At the bottom of the page, click on Upload this file button."""
The same screen refreshes with the filename now written in the text area.
The button at the bottom has now changed to Upload users. Click on this Upload users button.
The next page shows a preview of the users that we are uploading.  Verify that the values are correct. Check the Settings section now.
The Upload type drop-down has 4 options.
"""These 3 options can be used to update the records of existing users. We will select Add new only, skip existing users."""
"""This means that if a username is already existing, it will not be added."""
"""In the New user password drop-down, select Field required in file."""
"""Under Force password change, select All. This will prompt all users to change their passwords when they login for the first time."""
We will let the other fields in this section remain default.
Let us look at the Default values section now.
"""Under Email display, select Allow only other course members to see my email address."""
"""You can input the default fields, if they are same for all users. These fields will be used for all uploaded users."""
I will type Mumbai in City/Town.
"""Next, click on Show more… There are more fields that we can enter data into."""
"""But notice that none of them are mandatory. So, I will let these remain blank for now."""
"""At the bottom of the page, click on Upload users button."""
Look at the status column of the Upload users results table displayed here.
"""For the 1st user, the status message is: User not added - already registered."""
"""This user already exists in the system, so it was skipped."""
Rest of the users have been added as New users.
Look at the status displayed here.
Weak passwords are the ones that do not follow password rules.
"""Though these will be uploaded in the system, it is always preferable to have strong passwords."""
Click on Continue button. Let us view all the users that we created.
"""Click on Site Administration. Then click on the Users tab. Under the Accounts section, click on Browse list of users."""
We now have 4 users.
"""With this, we come to the end of the tutorial. Let us summarize."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to: add a user, edit a user’s profile, upload users in bulk."""
"""The Spoken Tutorial team conducts workshops and gives certificates. For more details, please write to us."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on First C++ program.
"""In this tutorial I am going to explain,"""
How to write a C++ program
"""How to compile it, How to execute it"""
We will also explain some common errors and their solution.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10 and"""
G++ Compiler version 4.5.2 on Ubuntu.
You should be familiar with Ubuntu Operating System and an Editor
Some editors are 'vim' and 'gedit'.
I am using 'gedit' in this tutorial.
For relevant tutorial please visit our website which is as shown.
Let me tell you how to write a C++ program through an example.
"""Open the  terminal Window using Ctrl,  Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To open the text editor, type on the terminal."""
“gedit” space “talk” dot “.cpp” space ampersand “&” sign.
We use the “&” to free up the prompt.
Please note that all the C++ files will have the extension “.cpp”.
"""Now   Press Enter,"""
Let us start to write a program.
Type double slash “//” space “My first C++ program”.
"""Here, double slash is used to comment the line."""
Comments are used to understand the flow of program.
It is useful for documentation.
It gives us information about the program.
The double slash is called as single line comment. Now press Enter.
"""Type (hash) “#include”, space, opening angle bracket, closing angle bracket ."""
"""It is  a good practice to complete the brackets first, and then start writing inside it."""
"""Now Inside the bracket, type “iostream” ."""
Here iostream is a header file.
This file includes the declaration of  standard input output functions  in C++. Now press Enter.
Type “using” space “namespace” space “std” and a semicolon “;” .
The using statement informs the compiler that you want to use the std namespace.
The purpose of namespace is to avoid name collisions.
It is done by localizing the names of identifiers.
It creates a declarative region and defines a scope.
Anything defined within a namespace is in the SCOPE of that namespace.
Here std is the namespace in which entire standard C++ library is declared. Now press Enter.
"""Type “int” space “main” opening bracket, closing bracket ."""
main is a special function.
It denotes that the execution of the program begins from this line.
The opening and the closing bracket is called as Parenthesis.
Parenthesis followed by main  tells the user that main is a function.
"""Here, the int main()  function takes no arguments and returns a value of type integer."""
We will learn about data types in another tutorial.
Now  let us switch to the slides to know more about  main function.
Every program should have  one main function.
There should NOT be more than one “main” function.
Otherwise the compiler cannot locate the beginning of the program.
The empty pair of parentheses indicates that main has no arguments.
The concept of arguments will be discussed in  the upcoming tutorials.
Now come back to our program. Press Enter.
Type opening curly bracket “{”.
The opening  curly  bracket marks the beginning of the function main().
Then Type closing curly bracket “}”.
The closing bracket indicates the end of the function main().
"""Now, inside the bracket press enter twice."""
Move the cursor one line up.
Indentation makes the code easier to read.
It also helps to locate errors faster.
So let us  give a  space here.
And type “cout” space two opening angle bracket '.
Here cout is a standard C++ function to print the output on the terminal.
"""Now  after the brackets, type within  double quotes."""
"""Anything within the double quotes, in the cout  functions, will be printed."""
Now inside a quote type“Talk to a teacher backslash n” ().
Here  signifies newline.
"""As a result, after execution of the cout function, the cursor moves to the new line."""
Every C++ statement must end with a semicolon.
Hence type it at the end of this line.
Semicolon acts as a statement terminator. Now press Enter.
Give a space here and  Type “return” space “0” and a semicolon “;”.
This statement returns the integer zero.
An integer has to be returned for this function because the function type is int.
The return statement marks the end of executable statements.
We will learn more about the returned values in another tutorial.
Now click on “Save” button to save the file.
It is a good habit to save files frequently.
This will protect you from sudden power failures.
It will also be useful in case the applications were to crash.
Let us now compile the program.
Come back to our  terminal.
Type “g++” space “talk.cpp” space hyphen “-o” space “output”.
Here g++ is the compiler used to compile C++ programs.
talk.cpp is our filename.
"""hyphen -o output says that the executable should go to the file """"output""""."""
We see that the program is compiled.
"""By typing ls space hyphen lrt, we can see that output is the last file to be created."""
"""Let us  execute a  program,  type  “./output” (dot slash output)."""
And  Press Enter.
Here the output is displayed as “Talk to a teacher”.
Now let us see the common errors which we can come across.
Switch  back to  our text editor.
Suppose here we miss the }(closing curly bracket)
now save the file.
Let us execute. Come back to our  terminal.
Now compile and run the program using the command we used before. We see an error.
"""We see that there is an error at line no.7 in our talk.cpp file  that """"expected curly bracket at the end of input""""."""
Now  Come back to our  text editor .
"""As I said before, the closing curly bracket marks the end of the function main"""
Hence re-insert the bracket here. Now Save the file.
Let us execute it again.
You can recall the previously entered commands by using up arrow key.
That is what I did now.
"""Yes, it is working."""
I will show you another common error.
Let us switch back to our text editor.
"""Now, suppose here we missed std."""
Let us save the file.
Come back to our  terminal .
Let us compile .
We see that there is an  error at line no.3 and  line no.6 in our talk.cpp file.
"""That """"expected identifier before 'semicolon' """" and """" 'cout' was not declared in this scope""""."""
As cout is the standard C++ library function.
and the entire C++ library function is defined under std namespace .
Hence it is giving an error.
Let us now  fix the error.Come back to our Text editor.  Type std here.
Let us save it.
Let us compile it again.
"""Yes, it is working.As an assignment,"""
write a program to print your name and city.
We used single line comment in this tutorial.
Now just try to give a multiline comment.
"""For more details, please  write to  contact @spoken-tutorial.org"""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Loops in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial we will learn,"""
"""for loop,while loop and"""
do…while loop.  We will do this with the help of some examples.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
Let us start with the introduction to loops.
Loops are used to execute a group of instructions repeatedly.
Depending on the purpose they are divided into three types:
while loop  do…..while loop and
for loop Let us start with the while loop first.
A while loop tests the condition in the beginning.
The structure is: while ( condition )
within the bracket statement block.
Now move on to  do….while loop .
A do..while loop is executed at least once before the condition could be validated.
The structure is:
"""do (within the brackets) statement block,"""
after the bracket the while ( condition ).
You can see that the condition is checked at the end.
"""Now,let us see an example on while loop and do...while loop ."""
I have already typed the code on the editor.
Let me open it.
Note that our file name is while.c..
Today we are going to learn addition of first 10 numbers using while loop.
Let me explain the code now.
Inside the main() function we have declared two integer variables x and y and initialized to 0.
This is our while loop.
The condition of the while loop is x is less than or equal to 10.
Here the value of x is added to the value of y.
The value obtained after the addition is stored in y.
Then we print the value of y.
Here  x is incremented.
That means the variable x is increased by one.
"""Now,let us execute the program."""
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Type gcc space while dot c space hyphen o space while
Type   ./while  (dot slash while). Press Enter.
The output is displayed.
Now lets us see the working of  while loop.
Let me resize the window.
"""Here, first the  value of  x  and  y  is 0."""
This is our  while  condition.
Here we check whether x is less than or equal to 10 which means the values of x will be from 0 to 10.
"""Then we add y plus x (i.e) 0 plus 0, we get 0."""
"""We print the value of y, here we get 0."""
Then x is incremented which means now the value of x will be 1.
"""Then we  will check the condition again, 1 is less than or equal to 10. If the condition is  true  then we will add the values,"""
y (i.e ) 0 plus x that is 1. 0 plus 1 is 1.
We print the value as 1.
Again x is incremented.
Now the value of x is 2.
We check the condition again.
"""2 is less than or equal to 10, if the condition is  true  then we will add the values, (i.e ) 1 plus 2 which will give 3."""
We print the value as 3.
"""Like this, it will go on up to x is less than or equal to 10 (x<=10)."""
"""Now, we will see the same program using  do….while loop  ."""
Here is our program.
Note that our file name is  do hyphen while dot c .
This part is already explained in the previous program.
"""So, let us move on to a  do...while loop ."""
"""Here, first the body of the loop will be executed  and then the condition is checked."""
The value of x is added to the value of y and the value obtained after the addition is stored in y.
The logic is same as in  while  program.
Type  gcc space do hyphen while dot c space hyphen o space do . Press  Enter .
Type  dot slash do (./do). Press Enter .
We can see that the output is similar  to our  while  program.
"""Now, let us see the working of  do...while loop ."""
Let me resize the window.
Here the value x and y is 0.
We add those values. Then we will get 0.
Now the value of y is 0.
We print the value as 0.
"""Then x is incremented by 1 which means now the value of x is 1, then the condition will be checked."""
You can see that the body of loop is executed first.
"""Anyhow, if the condition is  false  then also we will get a value that is 0."""
"""Now, here we will check whether 1 is less than or equal to 10."""
The condition is true. Again we will add the values.
Now 0 plus 1.
Then we will print the value of y as 1.
Again x will be incremented.
Now the value of x is 2.
Then we check 2 is  less than or equal to 10.
We will go back here.
Then we will add the values. 1 plus 2 is 3.
We print the value of y as 3.
"""Like this, the conditions will be checked till the value of x will be less than or equal to 10."""
Note that here the while condition ends with the semicolon.
In while loop the condition does not end with the semicolon.
Now let us see how to execute these programs in C++.
This is our while program in C++.
The logic and implementation are same as in our C program.
There are a few changes like the header file as iostream in place of stdio.h.
We have included the 'using' statement here using namespace std and here we have used the cout function in place of  printf  function.
The structure of  while loop is same as in our C program.
Lets us execute the program.
Come back to a terminal.
"""To execute, type   g++ space while dot cpp space hyphen o space while1 . Press Enter ."""
Type  dot slash while1 (./while1). Press  Enter .
You can see that the output is similar to our while program in C.
Now let us see the  do... while  program in C++.
Come back to the text editor.
"""Here also there are similar changes like the  header file , the  using statement  and the  cout  function."""
Rest of the things are similar.
Type  g++ space do hyphen while dot cpp space hyphen o space do1 . Press  Enter .
Type  dot slash do1 (./do1). Press  Enter .
We can see that the output is similar to our  do...while program in C.
Now we will see some common errors and their solutions.
Come back to our text editor.
"""Suppose, here I will not increment the value of x."""
Click on Save Let us see what happens.
Come back to the terminal Let me clear the prompt.
Press the up-arrow key twice.
Again press the up-arrow key.
The output is displayed.
"""We can see number of zeros, this is because the loop does not have the terminating condition ."""
It is known as  infinite loop.
Infinite loop  can cause the system to become unresponsive.
It causes the program to consume all the  processors  time  but it can be terminated.
"""Come back to our program, let us fix the error."""
Type  x++  and a semicolon.
Click on Save. Let us execute again.
Come back to terminal.
Press the up-arrow key.
"""Yes, it is working."""
We will move back to our slides.
"""In this tutorial we learned,"""
while loop   example. while(x is less than or equal to 10)

and here will be the body of the loop.
Hello everybody.
Welcome to this tutorial on Control Execution in KTurtle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
'while' loop  and
'for' loop.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS Version 12.04 KTurtle version 0.8.1 beta."""
We assume that you have basic working knowledge of Kturtle.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website: http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Let's open a new KTurtle Application.
Click on Dash  home.
"""In the Search bar, type: """"kturtle""""."""
Click on the option. KTurtle Application opens.
Let me first explain about what is control execution.
Control execution is controlling the flow of a program.
Different conditions are used to control program execution.
"""Loop is a block of code,  executed repeatedly till a certain condition is satisfied."""
e.g. “while” loop and  “for” loop.
Let's begin the tutorial with “while” loop.
"""In  the “while” loop, the code inside the loop repeats till Boolean evaluates to """"false""""."""
Let me explain the structure of “while” loop: while 'loop condition' {  do something with loop increment variable }
I already have the code in a text-editor.
Let me copy the program from text editor and paste it into KTurtle editor.
Please pause the tutorial here and type the program into your KTurtle editor.
Resume the tutorial after typing the program.
"""Let me zoom into the program text, it may possibly be a little blurred."""
Let me explain the code.
'#' hyash sign comments a line written after it.
"""It means, this line will not be executed while running the program."""
reset command sets “Turtle” to its default position.
$x=0 initializes the value of variable 'x' to zero.
"""Message in a program is given within double quotes after the keyword  """"message"""". “message” command takes string as input."""
It shows a pop-up dialog-box containing text from the string.
"""while $x<30 checks the “while” condition,"""
$x=$x+3 increments the value of  variable $x by 3.
fontsize 15  sets the font-size used by print command.
"""fontsize takes number as input, set in pixels."""
forward 20 commands Turtle to move 20 steps forward on the canvas.
print $x displays the value of variable 'x' on the canvas.
Let me click on the Run button to run the program.
A message dialog-box pops up. Let me click OK.
"""Multiples of 3, from 3 to 30, are displayed on the canvas."""
Turtle moves 20 steps forward on the canvas.
Let's next work with “for” loop.
“for” loop is a counting loop.
"""Every time  the code inside for loop is executed,"""
variable value is incremented till it reaches the end value.
Let me explain the structure of “for” loop.
for variable = start number to end number { Statement}
Let me clear the current program.
"""Let me type """"clear"""" command and run to clean the canvas."""
Let me copy the program from text-editor and paste it into KTurtle editor.
Please pause the tutorial here and type the program into your KTurtle editor.
Resume the tutorial after typing the program.
"""Let me zoom into the program text, it may possibly be a little blurred."""
Let me explain the program.
reset command sets Turtle to its default position.
$r=0 initializes the value of variable 'r' to zero.
for $x= 1 to 15 checks “for” condition  from 1 to 15.
$r=$x*($x+1)/2 calculates the value of variable 'r'.
fontsize 18 sets the font-size used by print command.
print $r displays the value of  variable 'r'  on the canvas.
forward 15 commands Turtle to moves 15 steps forward on the canvas.
"""go 10,250 commands Turtle to go 10 pixels from left of canvas and 250 pixels from top of canvas."""
“Turtle” displays all print commands without any time gap.
"""“Wait 2” command makes Turtle to wait for 2 seconds, before executing next command."""
“print” command displays the string within double quotes and also displays variable '$r'.
Let me click on the  Run button to run the program.
"""A series of sum of first 15 natural numbers and  """"Sum of first 15 natural numbers"""" are displayed on the canvas."""
Turtle moves 15 steps forward on the canvas.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial."""
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learned to use"""
“while” loop and “for”  loop.
"""As an assignment, I would like you to write programs to evaluate-"""
Multiples of 2 using “while” loop.

Welcome to this Spoken tutorial of Mozilla Firefox.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Tabbed Browsing, Storing content offline, Blocking Pop-ups."""
"""In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04."""
Mozilla Firefox allows you to load multiple web pages into separate tabs within the same browser window.
The biggest advantage of tabbed browsing is that it eliminates the need to display multiple browser windows.
And hence it helps to keep your desktop clutter-free.
Each tab occupies the browser's entire viewing area when displayed.
It eliminates the need to frequently resize and reposition the opened browser windows.
Tabbed browsing also consumes less memory and operating system resources than tiled-window browsing
provided the user does not open too many tabs at once.
"""Let's say, you are on a particular webpage."""
Here is a link - “Firefox for Desktop”.
You can open this link in a new tab.
"""To do so, right-click on the link."""
"""In the context menu, click on Open link in new tab."""
"""You notice that a new tab opens to the right of the existing tab, in the same browser window."""
"""So, without closing or moving out of your window, you can open another webpage in the same window."""
You can also open a new tab by clicking on File and New Tab.
The shortcut keys for this are Ctrl+T.
"""Notice that when you open a new tab, the new tab immediately becomes active."""
Now go to the URL bar and type: ‘www.google.com’.
"""You will now have 3 tabs, each with a different web page!"""
You can also open a new tab by clicking the ‘+’  button to the right of the rightmost tab.
We can also arrange  the tabs as per our requirements.
"""Just click on a tab and without releasing the mouse button, move it to the required location."""
Now release the 'mouse button'.
The tab is now in the desired location.
Let us look at some basic operations which Mozilla Firefox allows us to perform.
Let us change the search engine to “google”.
In the Search bar type: ‘email wikipedia’ and click on the magnifying glass to the right of the 'Search bar'.
The relevant Wikipedia page is the first search result.
Let's open this page by clicking on the link.
"""Now, click on File and then on “Save Page As”."""
Let's save the file on the Desktop with the name ‘Search.html’.
"""Now, let us open a new tab in the browser window by clicking on File and New Tab."""
"""Now, let's open our saved page in this new Tab window."""
Click on File and Open File .
Browse and open the saved file.
"""In the URL bar, you see that the address is not an internet address but a local location on your computer."""
"""Now you can read this page, even when you are offline."""
Pop-ups are windows that appear automatically without your permission.
Firefox allows us to control both pop-ups and pop-unders through the Content tab within Preferences window.
"""On 'Windows', this would be within the Options window."""
"""Pop-up blocking is turned on, by default."""
Click on Edit and Preferences.
Windows users please click on Tools and Options.
"""In the Content tab, the first option Block pop-up windows is checked, by default."""
"""If not, then please check this option."""
The various options of this dialog box will be discussed in another tutorial.
Click on the Close button.
Here is a quick summary of what we learnt:
"""Tabbed Browsing, Storing content offline, Blocking Pop ups."""
Try this comprehension test assignment.
Open a new tab.Change the search engine to ‘google’.
Search for 'The history of email'.
Save the first result and open it in a new tab to view as an offline document.
Change the search engine to ‘bing’.
"""Again, search for 'The history of email'."""
Save the link ‘History of Email & Ray Tomlinson’ and open it in a new tab to view as an offline document.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Creating classes.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
A class in real world
A class in Java
Structure of a Java class
Syntax for a Java class
And a simple example of Java class.
"""Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know how to write, compile and run a simple Java program in Eclipse."""
"""If not, please see the spoken-tutorial on these topics, available at spoken-tutorial.org."""
Now let us see what is a class in real world.
Whatever we can see in this world are all objects.
And all the objects can be categorized into special groups.
Each group is termed as a class.
"""For example, human being is a class."""
We are all different objects of this class.
"""We all have different properties like eyes, legs, hands etc."""
which are common to the 'human being' class.
"""Seeing, eating, walking etc are behaviors that are common to the human being class."""
Now let us see what is the class in Java?
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.
Structure of a Java Class; A class defines:
A set of properties called variables .
And a set of behaviors called methods.
"""Now, let us see the syntax for declaring classes."""
"""modifier – class -classname within  curly brackets variable, constructor and method declarations."""
"""We will learn about these in detail, in the coming tutorials."""
"""Now, let us create a simple class  using Eclipse."""
I have already opened Eclipse.
Now let us create a Project.
"""So click on File, go to New  and click on Java Project."""
"""In the New Project Wizard, enter the Project name  as ClassDemo with C and D in capital."""
Then click on Finish.
We see that the Project ClassDemo is created.
We will now create a Java class named Student.
"""So, right click on ClassDemo, go to New and click on Class."""
"""In the New Java Class wizard, type the Name as Student."""
We can see that the modifier here is public.
This shows that the class is visible to all the classes everywhere.
"""If a class has no modifier which is the default, it is visible only within its own package."""
We will learn about packages in the later tutorials.
Here I have selected public.
"""In the 'method stubs', select public static void main."""
Then click on Finish.
We can see that the class named Student is created.
"""Now, let me remove the comments."""
"""A Student class can contain properties like Name, Roll Number, Marks etc."""
"""So, inside this class Student, let me declare two variables roll_Number and name."""
"""So, I will type int roll underscore number semicolon."""
String name semicolon.
"""So, I have declared two variables."""
"""Now, a class also contains methods."""
"""So, let me create a method named StudentDetail."""
This method will give the details of each student.
"""So let me type, void studentDetail then opening and closing brackets, curly brackets open."""
"""Now, this method will give the roll_number and name of the Student."""
"""So, type System dot out dot  println within brackets and double quotes The roll number  is  we can type it as number is, close the double quotes plus roll_number semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: System dot  out dot println within brackets and double quotes The name is plus  name and semicolon."""
"""Now, inside the main method, we will type: System dot out dot  println within brackets and double quotes We have created a class with 2 variables and 1 method."""
"""Thus, We have created  the class student."""
"""Now, let me save the file by pressing Control and S keys simultaneously."""
Let me Run the program by pressing Control and F11 keys simultaneously.
"""We get the output as :We have created a class with 2 variables and 1 method,"""
just as we had typed in the main method.
Thus we have successfully created a class.
"""So, in this tutorial, we learnt about the class in java and how to create a class in java."""
"""For self assessment, create a class named Employee with variables emp underscore number and emp underscore name ."""
And method printEmployee which displays the employee information.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on If else constructs in java.
About conditional statements
Types of conditional statements and
How to use conditional statements in Java programs.
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu v 11.10 JDK 1.6  and  Eclipse 3.7.0."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of using:"""
"""Arithmetic, Relational and Logical operators in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown."""
Conditional statements- You may have to perform different actions for different decisions in your code.
In such cases you can use conditional statements.
A conditional statement helps to control the flow of execution of a program.
"""In Java, we have the following conditional statements:"""
If statement If...Else statement
If...Else if statement
Nested If statement Switch statement
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about If, If...Else and If...Else If statements in detail."""
if statement: if statement is used to execute a block of statements based on a condition.
It is called a single conditional statement.
Syntax for If statement ;
"""In the if statement, if the condition is true, the block is executed."""
"""If the condition is false, the block is skipped and it is  not executed."""
"""Now,  let us look at an example to understand how the if statement can be used."""
"""So, let us switch to eclipse."""
We will write a program to identify whether a person is Minor.
I have already created a class Person.
"""Now, inside the main method, let us declare a variable ‘age’ of type int."""
"""So, type inside the main method: int space age  equal to 20 semicolon."""
"""Now, we will write an If statement as follows:"""
"""Next line, if  within  brackets age < 21  open curly brackets. Press Enter."""
"""Here, we are checking if age is less than 21."""
Whatever is inside the brackets belongs to the if block.
"""So, inside the brackets type:"""
System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The person is Minor  semicolon.
"""Here, if age is less than 21, then “The person is minor” will be displayed."""
So save and run the file.
"""We get the output as follows: """"The person is minor""""."""
"""In this case, the person's age is 20 which is less than 21."""
"""So, we got the output as “The person is minor”."""
"""Now, we will learn about if...else statement."""
If...Else statement is used to execute alternative statements.
These are based on a single condition.
Let us look at the syntax for writing If…Else statement.
"""If the condition is true,   the statement or block of code is executed."""
"""Else, it executes another statement or  block of code."""
We will now see how the If…else statement can be used in a program.
"""So, let us switch to the eclipse."""
We will now  write a program to identify whether the person is minor or major.
"""So, inside the main method, type: int age  equal to 25"""
"""then, if within brackets age greater than 21"""
"""within curly brackets, type: System dot out dot  println within brackets The person is Major."""
"""Then type, next line,"""
else  within curly brackets  type:
System dot out dot println within brackets in double quotes  The person is Minor semicolon.
"""Here, if  age is less than 21,   “The person is Minor” will be displayed."""
"""Else, the “The person is Major” will be displayed."""
"""So, now let us save and  run the program."""
"""We get the output as: """"The person is Major""""."""
"""Here, the person's  age is 25, which is greater than 21."""
"""Therefore, the program  displayed  the output as “The person is Major”."""
If…Else If statement: If…Else If statement is used to execute various set of statements.
These are based on the two given conditions.
You can also add more conditions based on your requirement.
It is also called as   branching  or decision making statement.
"""Now, Let us look at the syntax for writing  the If…Else If statement."""
If statement initially checks for condition 1.
"""If condition 1 is true, it executes the statement-or-block 1 code."""
"""Else, it again checks for condition 2."""
"""If condition 2 is true, it executes statement-or-block 2."""
"""Else, it executes statement 3 or block code 3."""
"""In this way, we can extend the code by If…Else blocks."""
These blocks can have multiple conditions.
"""The corresponding code will get executed, until it finds the true condition."""
"""If all the conditions are false, it will execute the final Else section."""
We will see how the If…Else If statement can be used in a program.
"""So, switch to Eclipse."""
I have already created a class named Student.
Let us write a program to identify grade of a student.
This is done based on the score percentage.
"""So, inside the main method, type: int space testScore equal to 70 semicolon."""
The input variable named testScore is used to get the score percentage.
"""Next line, type: if within brackets testScore less than 35 then within curly brackets type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes C grade semicolon."""
"""If the 'testScore' is less than 35, then the program displays """"C Grade""""."""
"""Next line, type else."""
"""Next line, if within brackets testScore greater than or equal to 35 AND (&&) testScore  less than or equal to  60. Put this whole condition within brackets open curly brackets, press Enter."""
Type: System dot out dot println within brackets B grade semicolon
"""Here, the program will check for the second condition in the Else If section."""
"""If the 'testScore' is between 35 and 60 then the program displays """"B Grade""""."""
"""Next line, type: else within brackets type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes A grade semicolon."""
"""So Finally, if both the conditions are false, the program displays “A Grade""""."""
"""Now, let us save and run this code."""
We get the output as A Grade.
"""In this program, the student’s 'testScore' is 70."""
So the output will be displayed as “A Grade”.
Now  Let us change the testScore to  55.
"""Now, save and run this program."""
"""In this case, the output will be displayed as “B Grade”."""
We can also increase the number of conditions.
Let us add one more condition after the “B grade” output section.
"""So type here, else, next line, if within brackets testScore greater than or equal to 60 AND (&&) testScore less than or equal to 70."""
Open curly brackets press Enter System  dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes O grade semicolon.
"""Here, if the 'testScore' is between 60 and 70 the program will display """"O Grade""""."""
"""Now, change the testScore of the student to 70."""
"""Now, save and run the file."""
The program will display the output as “O grade”.
It is not “A grade” as it displayed before.
The program will display “A grade” for the testScore greater than 70.
While coding conditional structures:
Always remember to add a semicolon while terminating a statement.
But don’t add semicolons after the condition.
Add the block of code within curly brackets.
Curly braces are optional if the block contains a single statement.
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial,"""
We have  Explained: * conditional statements
Listed the types of conditional statements
"""Used conditional statements- if, if...else and if...else if in Java programs."""
"""Now take an assignment on writing java programs using conditional statements- if, if...else and if...else if statements."""
Write a java program to compare two values using if statement.
Write a java program to check whether the given number is even or odd.Hint : use if...else statement.
Write a java program to find the biggest number among the three numbers.Hint : use if...else if statement.

Welcome to this tutorial on how to write letters using latex.
You can see three windows.
These correspond to the three distinct phases in typesetting through latex:
"""creation of source file, compilation to produce the pdf file and viewing it through a pdf reader."""
I am using the free pdf reader “Skim” in Mac OSX because it automatically loads the latest pdf file after every compilation.
There are pdf browsers in Linux and also in Windows that have this capability.
Let us go through the source file and see what each command does.
The first line says that this belongs to 'letter document' class.
12 point is the text size.
The first component of the letter is the ‘from address’. It appears between the braces here.
The result of this is seen in the top right hand corner of the output file.
Two consecutive slashes start a new line.
If I remove the double slashes from here –
"""save, compile using pdflatex –"""
you can see that these two lines get merged in one line.
Previously with a double slash we asked latex to split the line.
"""Now these reverse slashes are no longer there, so latex does not know that it has to break the line there."""
Let me put the slashes back.
"""Save, Compile."""
It is to be understood that after every change we need to save before compilation.
Let us see what happens when we give an empty address.
"""Let me just come here,"""
"""mark it,"""
"""go to the end of the line, delete it, save it, compile it."""
You can see that the from address has disappeared from here.
"""Note that today’s date appears automatically in American style: month, date and then year."""
This is obtained through the command slash date slash today.
"""We can prevent the automatic appearance of the date with an empty list, as we do now."""
Save.
"""Compile,The date has gone."""
"""Suppose that we want to put our own date, let us enter it with date first as follows."""
"""9th July 2007, Save, Compile."""
Got the date.
This is the date on which this tutorial was created the first time.
"""On compiling it, we see this Indian format appearing in the output file."""
Let us put the address back.
And the document is back to the previous state by recompiling.
The signature command's argument appears at the bottom of the letter.
We begin the document and then the letter.
The ‘to address’ comes first. It appears in the top left hand corner of the output.
I have addressed this to Mr. N. K. Sinha.
The command ‘slash opening’ is used to address the recipient.
You may have already noticed that all latex commands begin with a reverse slash.
The text of the letter comes next.
One starts a new paragraph in latex through a blank line as we show now.
Let me come here. Right now this sentence starting at ‘we are’ is here.
Let’s open. Let's take this to the next line.
I have left a blank line. Let me save this.
Compile this.
You can see that this has gone to a new paragraph.
"""With a new paragraph, the letter has gone to two pages."""
"""Let us see if the font size is reduced to 10, we can bring the letter back to one page."""
Let me do that now.
Save.
"""Compile,You can see that the whole letter has come into one page."""
Let me put this back to 12 pt.
And let me also remove this paragraph bit.
And let me compile this.
Okay.
I now want to explain the itemize environment which is created with a pair of 'begin' and 'end itemize' commands.
Every piece of text that starts with a ‘slash item’ appears in a bulleted form.
Can I get numbers in the place of bullets here?
"""You just have to change the """"itemize"""" into """"enumerate"""" as I do now."""
"""Let me just change this to """"enumerate""""."""
Of course! It is always a good idea to save as often as possible.
Let me compile this again.
You can see that the bullets have become numbers now.
"""In closing, I have included, ‘Yours sincerely’ which comes here."""
We have already talked about the signature.
"""Finally, the command 'cc' helps mark this letter to other recipients."""
I end the letter with ‘end letter’ command and then the document is completed with the ‘end document’ command.
Feel free to modify the content and try them out.
"""Until you become confident, change only one thing at a time and make sure by immediate compilation that whatever you have done is correct."""
"""Although I talked about the letter writing process in a Mac, the same source file will work in all Latex systems including those in Linux and Windows operating systems."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installation of MarcEditor on Windows.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to install  MarcEditor  on a 64-bit Windows machine."""
"""To record this tutorial, I’m using: Windows 10 Pro Operating System and  Firefox web browser."""
This tutorial is most suitable for library staff.
"""Before moving ahead, please ensure that you have the following on your machine- Windows 10, 8 or 7,"""
"""any web browser. For eg: Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome."""
"""In your existing library, you may have the library records in an Excel spreadsheet."""
"""And, your library is now being migrated to Koha Library Management System."""
"""So, all the records will need to be converted from Excel into MARC format."""
It is important to know that: the records in Excel spreadsheet will first have to be converted into MARC format and then imported into Koha.
This is because Koha does not have the provision to directly import data which is in Excel format.
Let us begin.
"""To convert Excel data into MARC file i.e. (dot) mrc format, we will be using MarcEdit software."""
"""To install this software, go to the browser and type this URL."""
A new page with the heading Downloads opens.
"""Under Current Development, go to MarcEdit 7.0.x/MacOS 3.0.x  Locate Windows 64-bit download."""
"""However, if you have a 32-bit machine, then you should click on the link Windows 32-bit download."""
"""To check whether your machine is 32-bit or 64-bit, go to the bottom left corner of the machine."""
Click on the Start icon.
Scroll up and click on Settings.
"""From these icons, click on System- Display, notifications, apps, power."""
This opens another window with few options on the left side.
Locate the tab About and click on it.
"""On the same page, towards the right side, under the section PC, locate System type."""
The details of your machine’s operating system will be displayed.
"""For my machine, it says 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor."""
"""After reading the details, close the window."""
"""To do so, go to the top right corner and click on the cross mark."""
"""We will again come back to the same page, Downloads."""
"""As my machine is 64-bit, I will click on 64-bit download."""
Another new window with the heading 64-bit download opens with two sections- Non-Administrator and Administrator.
"""Next, I will click on Download MarcEdit 7 link at the bottom of the Administrator section."""
This is because I am the designated Koha administrator of my library.
A dialog-box MarcEdit_Setup64Admin.msi appears.
We can see 2 options here- Save File and   Cancel.
Click on the Save File button at the bottom.
"""After doing so, go to the Downloads folder of your machine."""
"""Here, you can see that the file MarcEdit_Setup64Admin.msi has been saved."""
"""Now, right-click on the saved file and from the options that appear, click on Install."""
"""In the User Account Control dialog box, click on Yes."""
Another window with the name Welcome to the MarcEdit 7 Setup Wizard appears.
Click on the Next button at the bottom of the page.
Another new window with the title License Agreement opens.
Read the License Agreement carefully.
"""And from the 2 options, I do not agree and I agree, click on the I Agree radio button."""
"""Then, click on the Next button at the bottom of the window."""
A new window named Select Installation Folder opens.
It shows the path of the folder where the installed software will be saved.
"""Alternately, you may install this software in a different folder of your choice. Do so by typing the required path in the field Folder."""
You can also click on the tab Browse and select the desired path.
"""However, I will keep the folder path as it is, in the field Folder."""
Now click on the Next button at the bottom of the window.
Another new window   Confirm Installation opens.
Now click on the Next button at the bottom of the same window.
Installing MarcEdit 7 window opens.
"""After this, we see a success message window. It says-  Installation Complete. MarcEdit 7 has been successfully installed."""
Click on the Close button to exit this window.
A window with the title MarcEdit 7.0.250 By Terry Reese opens.
Now minimize all the windows that are open.
You will see that a shortcut is created on the Desktop.
"""With this, we have successfully installed MarcEditor on the Desktop of a 64-bit Windows machine."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of Meet the GIMP.
In the previous tutorial I left you with this image.
I want to make the ship a bit darker in this image.
And the best way to do this is to work with Layers.
"""So, first I zoom into the image where the ship is."""
And I click on the option of adding a New Layer and simply add a new layer.
I name this layer as 'ship' and I choose the Layer Fill Type as Transparency.
Now the next step is to reduce the luminosity of all the three colour channels and to do that I have to use the Multiply mode & this time
I use gray colour to be multiplied with the other colours here because it helps in getting the ship darker in the image.
"""So, go to the option of colour selection mode and reduce the value of gray colour by pulling the slider down until I get a nice gray colour shade."""
"""And now, just pull the gray colour into the image and you get a darker image with a dark ship."""
"""Coming back to the Layers dialog, I can control the intensity of gray colour with the help of opacity slider and by turning the gray layer on and off."""
But the effect of the layer is applied to the whole image and I want the effect to be restricted to the area of the ship.
"""For doing that, I use a layer mask."""
A layer mask defines where the layer should be visible and where it should be invisible.
I go to the layer named ship and I right click on that layer. And then select the option Add Layer Mask and I select Black in Initialize Layer Mask because black helps in hiding all the layers & white helps t
And these other options I will explain in future tutorials. Click on Add.
You can see the layer has no effect.
"""I can switch the layer on & off, but no effect after adding layer mask."""
But I can paint into the layer mask or use some other edit tools.
"""And when I paint or use the tools , the effect will be revealed into the image."""
"""To paint into the layer, I use white foreground colour & black background colour."""
"""I click on the Brush tool, go to the option dialog, and select a  brush which is 19 pixels in Circle."""
And I again go to the Layers dialog to check if the layer mask is selected because I have to paint the layer mask and not the layer.
Let me show you the effect.
I change the layer mode to Normal layer mode & as you see the fore layer in the image is invisible.
I select a brush here and start painting on the portion of the ship and you can see a gray layer is revealed.
"""Now when I select the layer itself & paint, you can see the layer is now painted in white colour and not gray."""
I select the layer mask again and press the ‘x’ key to change the foreground colour to black and background colour to white.
And start painting with white colour into my layer mask.
And because of  black colour the image is hidden.
I can undo the unwanted effects simply by pressing ctrl + z and here we are back to paint the layer mask of the ship.
Now I change the background colour to black and foreground colour to white and start filling the form of the ship.
I think it’s much easier to paint in Normal mode.
"""As we get a gray ship after painting in Normal mode, it is easier to differentiate from  background than in Multiply layer mode."""
"""To paint into the fine edges of the ship, I reduce the brush size."""
You can select a small brush in 3 different methods.
"""First is by using the scale to reduce the size of the brush,"""
2nd way is to click the small blue triangle here and select the brush of any size or else you can do that by typing the square brackets.
'Open square bracket' reduces the brush size and 'close square bracket' increases the size of the brush.
"""I want to use the small brush for the details, so I press 'open square bracket'."""
But you can imagine what I have to do here and you don’t have to look over my shoulder for painting the whole ship.
Now I have finished painting the whole ship with a gray layer.
And I will have to check for the areas where I have overpainted the edge.
"""So, I switch the layer mode to Multiply mode and reduce the opacity slider a bit."""
Adjust the opacity slider in such a way that you get a dark ship in the image.
And I have done a fairly good job.
But I am not so happy with the surface of the river in front of the ship.
And I have to make it a bit brighter.
"""So, I change the foreground colour to black by pressing the x key and start painting into the surface of the river in front of the ship with black colour to make it less darker than the ship."""
I have to check out this effect once I finish working on the image and do the changes accordingly.
Now let’s check out the work I have done.
I zoom into the image using the  zoom mode and I can make the ship a bit darker and brighter just by sliding the opacity slider.
I think this looks good and I have done a good job by masking the layer.
"""But I think the colour of the ship is a bit dull and this is possible because the 'ship' layer is above the 'colour correction layer' and they are working before the ship layer; so I just drop the 'ship' lay"
"""And you can see the change, the colour of the ship gets neutral now."""
Now I look at the whole image and the shortcut key is Shift+ Ctrl +E.
"""And I think it is a fairly good balance between the background colour, the birds and the ship. Perhaps I should slide down a bit with the intensity of the ship."""
And now it looks better.
I think this is best.
"""When I compare the image without darkening and  the ship layer, the birds and the ship are fairly dark in the ship layer and I think I got a good result by using layer mask for this image."""
I can change the effects with the help of all the layer tools at anytime.
"""I nearly forgot a thing that I painted the layer mask with very sharp edge & when I zoom into the image, you can see there is a hard border here and I want a little bit smoother."""
"""Because this may look a bit artificial, specially in a foggy seen."""
"""For that, I select the layer mask to edit it a bit and choose Filter from the tool bar and select Blur."""
In Blur I choose Gaussian Blur and go into the part of the ship and I drop down the value of Horizontal Radius to 4 and click on OK and blur the layer mask and you can see the effect that the hard edge of the
Now I m ready to do some corrective work with the image.
"""When you look at the image, you can see here a bit of wood in the water and on the left side is half a bird which is cut off at the edge and I want to clone them out."""
"""So, again I choose the Zoom tool, and zoom in where the part of wood is and now choose the Healing tool."""
Healing tool is bit like the Clone tool but it works better in this case here.
"""When I select the healing tool, I get a circle with the mouse point but I can’t click into the image & there is a forbidden sign in the mouse point."""
The forbidden sign is because I haven’t selected the heal source and I can do it with the control (Ctrl) and click.
I have to select a good heal source and then I have to press Ctrl and click and I think this is a good place as heal source and now click on the wood part.
There is a problem here.
And the problem here is that I am working on the wrong layer.
I have to work on the background layer and I was trying to do the edit on the layer mask.
"""Of course, I have to choose a background layer and make a copy of that layer because I don’t want to alter the original background layer."""
Now let's try Healing tool again.
And now I have made another mistake.
My source was this gray layer above.
"""And of course, I undo this and select a new source here. Alright, take that here and just click here and it is gone."""
"""For this part, I select this part as the source and click and you can see it’s gone."""
Let’s look at the image in 100% mode.
"""It looks quite good, perhaps I should have done it with a little bit greater brush because these dots are still together."""
So again I select the Healing tool and select the source and clicked on the dots.
I think that worked.
Now I have to disappear this half cut bird on the left side.
"""For this, I zoom again into the image here and  I select the Clone tool."""
Cloning tool is not so complex like healing tools and I really don’t have a big experience in using this tool as it is new in the GIMP.
"""So, I have to follow same procedure like Healing tool. I just click here as a source, click on the bird here and I think this works."""
"""Back to 100%. Perfect, this bird is gone."""
I think this image is ready now.
First I wanted to make this image a bit brighter but I think I do it as finishing steps and I think it works the way it is now.
And I want to give this image to print to get a poster from it.
"""And the printer uses an aspect ratio of 3:2 and this image has the aspect ratio 2:1. So now, I have to change that."""
I can do this with the help of canvas size which is there in Image in the tool bar.
I select Canvas Size and see that the image is 1868 pixels wide and the height is 945 and for calculating the ratio I use my calculator.
"""So, I divide 1868 by 3 and then multiply with 2 which gives me 1245."""
"""I have to unchain this here, otherwise the width will change too and type into the Height 1245."""
Now the image is OK.
"""It will fit on top and leave a white strip on the bottom and I don’t resize the layers, just click on OK and now I have an image with little bit of nothing on the bottom."""
"""I have to fill the bottom part and for that, I choose a New Layer with Layer Fill Type White and use this layer as the bottom most layer."""
This white area in the bottom will be cut off later.
But I can use it as the clue for the printer.
The printer is simply a computer with a print engine behind it and test to get some clues how to handle.
"""This image is quite unusual here, it is nearly black and white and it has not much contrast in it."""
"""I select a rectangle here just over the whole image, select the Blend tool, the gradient filled with, set the Gradient to 'black to white'."""
And now I fill this here up with the gradient.
Just click and draw a line and now I have the full colour range from black and white in the rectangle.
I have an area here from black to full white.
I repeat this one more time.
Choosing the Blend tool here and this time I use a special gradient called Full saturation; it has all the colour range in it.
"""And again fill this  gradient, now I have hints for the printer how to preserve the image and if the colours are off I can always say here, this was suppose to be red and this was suppose to be green."""
I think this was it for today.
"""For more information, go to info@ meet the gimp.org or leave a comment on the blog meet the gimp.org or come to the forum of """"tips from the top floor""""."""
"""Tell me what you liked, what I could have made better, what you want to see in the future."""
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Increment and Decrement Operators in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
Increment and decrement operators.
'++' eg. a++ which is postfix increment operator.
++a which is prefix increment operator.
'--' eg. a--  is  a postfix decrement operator.
--a  is a  prefix decrement operator.
We will also learn about Typecasting.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 11.10 as the operating system,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 in Ubuntu.
The ++ operator increases the existing value of the operand by one.
a++ and ++a are equivalent to a = a + 1.
The -- operator decreases the existing value of the operand by one.
a-- and --a are equivalent to a = a - 1.
I will now demonstrate the use of increment and decrement operators with the help of a C program.
"""I have already made the program, so I'll explain the code."""
"""Here, we have the code for increment and decrement operators in C."""
"""Here, I have taken an integer variable a that holds the value 1."""
This way we will be able to observe the changes in the value of a.
It will thus give us a better idea about the working of the operators.
Let's see how the postfix increment operator works.
The output of this printf statement is 1.
The value won't change.
This is because the postfix operation occurs after the operand is evaluated.
"""If an operation is performed on a++, it is performed on the current value of a."""
After that the value of a is incremented.
"""Now if we see the value of a here, it has been incremented by 1."""
We again initialize 'a' to 1 so as to reflect on the changes.
We now come to the prefix increment operators.
This printf statement prints 2 on the screen.
This is because a prefix operation occurs before the operand is evaluated.
So the value of 'a' is first incremented by 1 and then it is printed.
We again print a's value to see that there are no further changes.
Now let's check by executing this code.
"""I will comment out the following lines. Type /*, */"""
I have saved my file as incrdecr.c.
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""To compile, type the following on the terminal;  gcc space incrdecr dot c space minus o space incr. Press Enter."""
"""To execute the code, type ./incr (dot slash incr). Press enter."""
The output is displayed on the screen.
This is the output when you print a++.
This is the output when you print ++a.
We  can see that the result is as discussed before.
Now Coming back to the rest of the program.
I will now explain the postfix and prefix  decrement operators.
Remove the multi-line comments from here and here .
We now again assign the value of 1 to a.
This printf statement outputs the value of 1 as explained previously.
a's value will be decremented after a-- is evaluated as it is a postfix expression.
The next statement prints a's value as o.
a's  value has now being decremented by 1.
We now have the prefix decrement operator.
Output of this printf statement would be 0.
As it is a prefix operation.
The prefix operation occurs before the operand is evaluated.
This printf statements output is 0.
No further changes have been made to a's value.
Type return 0;  and close the ending curly bracket.
"""To compile, type the following on the terminal; gcc space incrdecr dot c space minus o space incr. Press Enter."""
"""To execute, type ./incr. Press Enter."""
This is the output when you print a--.
This is the output when you print --a.
"""So, now we see how the increment and  decrement operator work."""
"""If we want to write the same program in C++,"""
I can make a few changes to the above C code.
Let me go back to the editor.
Here is the C++ file with the necessary code.
Notice that the header is different from the C file header.
We have the using namespace statement also.
Also note that the output statement in C++ is cout.
"""So, apart from these differences, the two codes are very similar."""
Save the file. The file is saved with an extension .cpp.
Let's compile the code.
Open the terminal and type  g++ space incrdecr dot cpp space minus o space incr. Press Enter.
"""To execute, type  ./ incr (dot slash incr). Press Enter."""
The output is displayed on the screen.
"""So, we see the output is identical to the C program."""
We now have the concept of typecasting.
It is implemented the same way in both C and C++.
"""Typecasting is used to make a variable of one type, act like another type."""
"""Typecasting is done by enclosing the data type, you want, within parentheses."""
This cast is put in front of the variable you want to cast.
This typecast is valid for one single operation only.
"""Now a' will behave as a float variable, for a single operation."""
Here is an example that I have already created.
I shall now explain the code.
We first declare variables a and b as integers and c as float.
a is assigned the value of  5. b is assigned the value of 2.
We will perform operations on a and b.
We divide a by b. The result of division is stored in c.
We have used %.2f to denote a precision of 2 decimal places.
The result displayed will be 2.00 against the expected result of 2.50.
The fractional part has been truncated as both the operands a and b are integers.
"""To perform real division, one of the operands will have to be typecast to float."""
Here we are typecasting a to float. c now holds the value of real division.
Now the result of real division is displayed. The answer is 2.50 as expected.
Type return 0;  and close the  ending curly bracket.
Click on Save. Save the file with .c (dot c) extension.
I have saved my file as typecast.c.
Open the terminal.
"""To compile, type gcc space typecast dot c space minus o space type. Press Enter."""
"""To execute, type ./type. Press Enter."""
The output is displayed on the screen.
Looking at the two values we see the effects of typecasting.
We will summarize the tutorial now.
In this tutorial we learnt-
"""how  to  use the increment and decrement operators,"""
"""we learnt about the forms, Postfix  and Prefix,"""
also we  learnt about typecasting and how it is used.
As an assignment:
"""Write a program to solve the following expression, a divided by b plus c divided by d."""
"""The values of a, b, c and d are taken as input from the user."""
Use typecasting to perform real division.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Items and Inventory in FrontAccounting.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to add the following in FrontAccounting: Units of Measure"""
Items
Item Category and Sales Pricing
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04"""
To practise this tutorial you must have knowledge of Higher secondary commerce and accounting and Principles of Bookkeeping
And you should have already set up an Organisation/Company in FrontAccounting.
"""If not, for relevant FrontAccounting tutorials please visit this website."""
Start the XAMPP services before you begin working on FrontAccounting interface.
"""Before we start, let us understand what are Items in FrontAccounting."""
Items are the things which we can buy or sell in the business.
We have to keep a record that lists key information about an inventory item.
"""Inventory is a complete listing of Stock in hand,"""
"""Work in progress, Raw materials and  Finished goods in hand."""
Let us open the Frontaccounting interface.
Type the username as admin and the password. Click on Login button.
The Frontaccounting interface opens.
Click on the Items and Inventory tab.
Maintenance panel is used to set up Items and Inventory details.
"""To do the setup, we have to make use of the following options: Units of Measure"""
Items and  Item Categories
Let us see how to set Units of Measure.
Units of Measure option has to be specified for each Item.
"""In the Maintenance panel, click on Units of Measure link."""
By default you will see each and hour as units of measure.
Let us see how to add a new Units of Measure for kilograms.
Type the details for the unit kilograms as shown here.
"""In the Decimal places drop-down box, select zero."""
Click on the Add new button at the bottom of the window to add this unit.
The pop-up message shows that we have successfully added a new unit.
We can also see the table with the updated entry.
Likewise you have to add the required Units of measure for your company’s items.
Click on Back link at the bottom of the window to go back to the FrontAccounting interface.
Now let us set the Item Categories to which the item belongs.
Item Categories helps us to group the items we buy and sell.
Click on Item Categories link.
"""We can see some default Item categories here - Charges, Components, Services and Systems."""
"""We need to create our own Item category, which defines. Item tax type,"""
Item Type and Units of Measure
"""Say for example, our company deals with finished goods i.e Laptops."""
So we will add a new Item category named Finished Goods.
Fill the details as shown here. Category Name – Finished Goods
Item Tax Type - Regular Item Type - Purchased
Units of Measure - Each
Keep all the remaining fields with default values.
Click on the Add New button at the bottom of the window to save the entry.
We can see that the newly added details are updated in the above table.
Click on Back link at the bottom of the window to go back to the FrontAccounting interface.
Next let us create a new Item for this Item category.
"""In Maintenance panel, click on the Items link."""
"""Here, we are prompted to fill in all the necessary information for the item. Fill the details as shown here."""
Make sure that you give a unique code for each item you fill. This is mandatory.
Category is the Item category to which the item belongs. We have selected Finished Goods.
Item type is to know whether the item is used for: manufacturing purpose
purchased from a supplier or for a service
Scroll down. And then click on the Insert New Item button at the bottom of the window.
The pop-up message shows that we have successfully added a new item.
Click on the drop-down box at the top of the window.
We can see that the new item has been added.

"""After completing the assignment, click on the drop-down box at the top of the window."""
Now you should see 2 items under Components and 3 items under Finished goods.
Click on Back link at the bottom of the window to go back to the Frontaccounting interface.
Pricing and Costs panel is used for selecting the pricing level of the items or inventory.
This option is used to assign sales prices to individual Sales item. Click on the Sales Pricing link.
Click on the Item drop-down box. Select the item Dell Laptop for which we want to assign the Sales Price.
"""Now, click on the Currency drop-down box."""
Select the currency as Indian Rupees.
Click on the Sales Type drop-down box.
There are two options:  Retail and  Wholesale
"""Here select the option, Retail."""
"""Next, click on the Price field. Type the Price against the Item as 53,000 per each."""
Then click on Add New button at the bottom of the window.
The pop-up message shows that we have successfully added a Sales price for the item Dell Laptop.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Installing Eclipse on Linux.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Eclipse on Ubuntu and on Redhat operating systems."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.10."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must be"""
connected to the internet and must have knowledge of using terminal in Linux.
You must also have the root access or the sudo permission.
"""If you do not know what is a root or sudo, do not bother,"""
you can proceed through the tutorial.
"""If you are on a network that uses a proxy, then you must have access to the proxy."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials,  please visit our website as shown."""
We shall now install Eclipse on Ubuntu using the commands shown and
also learn about the minor changes required to do the same on Redhat.
Now let us open the terminal.
"""Press Control, Alt and t  ."""
This launches the terminal in Ubuntu.
"""If you are on a network that uses proxy, you will have to set it on the terminal."""
"""If you do not know what a proxy is, you may not be on a network that uses one."""
So you can skip this step.
"""For those who are using proxy,  will have to set it."""
There are two types of proxies.
One requires a username and password while the other doesn’t.
"""Find the type of proxy you are using, from the concerned person."""
"""On  the terminal, type: sudo SPACE HYPHEN s"""
"""When prompted, type the password."""
"""Note that as you type password, there is no feedback in the form of asterisk (*) or other symbols. Hit Enter."""
Notice that the prompt symbol has changed from 'DOLLAR' to 'HASH'.
Now type: export SPACE  http UNDERSCORE proxy  EQUAL TO http://tsuser:tspwd@10.24.0.2:8080
"""In this command, tsuser is the username for proxy authentication and tspwd is the password."""
Please change these values to suit your need.
10.24.0.2 is the host address of the proxy and 8080 is the port number.
Change these details also to suit your need. Press Enter.
In some cases the network does not require authentication.
In such cases the username and password can be left blank.
"""Since my proxy does not require authentication, I am going to remove those details."""
Press up arrow to get the previous command and remove the username and password and
Hit Enter. These commands  set the http proxy. We know how to set the https proxy.
Press up arrow to get the previous command and type 's' to change http to https and hit Enter.
We have now successfully set the proxy.
Press Ctrl + D to return to the normal prompt.
Type clear and hit Enter to clear the screen.
Now we shall install Eclipse.
Type: sudo SPACE apt HYPHEN get SPACE  update.
"""This command fetches a list of all the  available software, hit Enter."""
"""Depending on your internet speed, it takes a while to  fetch the list of software."""
The operation is complete when the terminal returns to  the 'DOLLAR' prompt($). Type clear and hit Enter to clear the screen.
Type: sudo space apt  hyphen get space install space eclipse and hit Enter.
This command fetches and installs the eclipse software on the system.
"""Notice the line that reads, Need to get 10.8 MB."""
Depending on your system this  number will be different and
"""depending on your internet speed, the time required to fetch the packages  will be different."""
At the prompt of 'Y' or 'N' type y and hit Enter.
All the required packages are  downloaded and unpack into the system.
The installation is complete when the terminal  returns to the Dollar prompt.
Now let us verify if eclipse is installed and is available on  the system.
"""Press  Alt+ F2, in the dialog box type  eclipse and hit Enter."""
"""This launches the eclipse application. If Eclipse has not been installed, it will not open the application."""
We get Workspace Launcher prompt. click OK to proceed.
And we get “Welcome to Eclipse” page.  This means  Eclipse has been successfully installed on the system .
"""The process for  installing Eclipse on Debian ,Kubuntu and Xubuntu is same as that on Ubuntu."""
The process of installing Eclipse on Redhat is similar to that on Ubuntu.
The only difference is the commands used for fetching and installing.
"""For fetching the list of  software, use sudo SPACE yum SPACE update."""
"""For installing eclipse, use sudo SPACE yum SPACE install SPACE eclipse."""
"""The process for installing Eclipse on Fedora, Centos and SUSE linux is the same as that on Redhat."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on grep command.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn grep command."""
We will do this with the help of some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS and GNU BASH version 4.2.24"
"""Please note, GNU bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
"""As prerequisites, you should know basics of Linux terminal."""
"""For relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown."""
"""First, let us know about  regular expressions ."""
* Regular expressions are pattern matching techniques.
"""* when we have to find out whether a pattern exists in a line, paragraph or a file."""
For ex. If you want to search a phone number in the telephone directory
"""or  to find a keyword in a paragraph or a line, we use grep command. Let us move on to grep."""
"""grep searches for one or more patterns in one or more lines, paragraph or a file."""
"""If file-name is not mentioned, grep searches for the patterns in the standard input."""
"""If filename is missing, grep searches for the patterns in the standard input."""
I will demonstrate usage of grep using a demo file called grepdemo.txt.
Let us see the content of the file.
This is a file that has 13 entries.
"""Each entry has 6 fields- roll number, name, stream, marks and stipend amount."""
The fields are separated by a bar which is called a delimiter.
Let us see how grep works.
"""Say, we want to use 'grep' command to see who are the students in the computers stream."""
"""For this, we have to open the terminal."""
"""Now, type on the terminal:"""
grep space (within double quotes) computers after the double quotes space  grepdemo .txt
This would enlist those entries where stream is computers.
"""Now, compare the result with the original file."""
Come back to our text editor.
We see that the entry for  Zubin is not enlisted.
Why this is so?
This is because grep searched for the pattern “computers” with small c
"""while for Zubin, the stream is “Computers” with a capital C."""
The pattern matching is case sensitive.
"""To make it case insensitive, we need to use the minus i  option with grep."""
"""Come back to our terminal. Now, type: grep space minus i  space within double quotes computers after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt"""
Press  Enter.This will now enlist all the four entries.
"""So we saw, grep enlists only those lines of files that match a given pattern."""
We may do the reverse.
It is possible to make grep enlist only those lines that do not match the pattern.
"""For that, we have the minus v option."""
"""Say, we want to enlist those entries of students who have not passed."""
We can also store this result in another file.
"""For this, type: grep space minus iv space within double quotes pass after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt space greater than sign space notpass.txt"""
"""To see the content of the file, type: cat space notpass.txt ."""
Press Enter.The output is displayed.
"""Now, at the prompt, type:"""
grep space minus i space within double quotes fail after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt and press Enter.
This will include those students who are failed but their result is incomplete.
"""If we want to see the line number in the file at which the enlisted entries are, we have the minus n option."""
Let us clear the prompt.
"""Now, type: grep space -in space within double quote """"fail"""" after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt"""
The line number is displayed.
The patterns so far have been of single word.
We may have multi-word patterns as well.
But the entire pattern must be within quotes.
"""So, type: grep space minus i space within double quotes ankit space saraf after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt"""
We see that Ankit Saraf's record is displayed.
We can also find patterns in multiple files.
"""For this, type: grep space minus i space within double quotes fail after double quotes space grepdemo.txt space notpass.txt"""
Press Enter. The output is displayed.
"""With multiple files, grep will write the name of the file in which the entry was found. grepdemo.txt and notpass.txt."""
These are the records from notpass.txt file and these are the records from grepdemo.txt file.
"""Suppose, we may only want to know the number of matches or count ."""
"""For that, we have the minus c option."""
"""So, type: grep space minus c space within double quotes Fail  with a capital F after the quotes space grepdemo.txt"""
This will give us the count of number of lines matched.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt:"""
To see the content of a file e.g. cat filename
To list the entries of a particular stream e.g. grep “computers” grepdemo.txt
To ignore cases e.g. grep -i “computers” grepdemo.txt
Lines that do not match the pattern e.g. grep -iv “pass” grepdemo.txt
To list the line numbers with the entries e.g. grep -in “fail” grepdemo.txt
To store the result in another file e.g. grep -iv “pass” grepdemo.txt  notpass.txt and
To know the count e.g. grep -c “Fail” grepdemo.txt.

"""Now, I will switch back to Linux to complete this demonstration."""
"""However, the steps shown will work in Inkscape on any OS."""
The main drawing area is called canvas. This is where we will create all the graphics.
"""There are various tool options and menu options in Inkscape. We will learn about each one, in detail, in the series."""
"""Now, let's briefly learn how to use Inkscape."""
We will create a rectangle shape by selecting the rectangle tool.
"""To draw the rectangle shape, click on the canvas and drag."""
Here is our rectangle.
Let me save this Inkscape drawing.
Go to File menu. Click on Save.
I will name it as drawing_1.svg and save it in my Documents folder.
"""Here, 'svg' denotes the default Inkscape file extension."""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Calling methods of the super class.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:   when to use the super keyword"""
How to call methods of the super class
How to invoke the constructor of the super class.
"""Here we are using: Ubuntu Version 12.04 ,JDK 1.7 ,Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have basic knowledge of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
You must also have knowledge of subclassing and method overriding in Java.
A subclass can use a superclass data or method using the super keyword.
"""The super keyword : refers to the instance variable of the parent class, is used to invoke parent class constructor, is used to invoke parent class method."""
"""Now, let us go to the IDE and to the project we created earlier."""
Let us go to the Manager class.
"""Now, come to the getDetails() method."""
"""In the return statement, let us remove Name and Email."""
"""Now, let us come to the Employee class."""
This is the parent class or super class.
We already have a getDetails() method here.
This method returns the name and email.
"""So, we can use this getDetails() method in the Manager class."""
"""We will call getDetails() method from the Employee class, inside the Manager class."""
"""So, come to the getDetails() method  in the manager class."""
"""Inside the return statement, type: super dot getDetails() plus slash n Manager of  getDepartment()."""
"""Now, let me run the program."""
We can see that we get the Manager details. Thus we can call the method of superclass inside the subclass.
Now let us come to the  Employee class.
Let us include a constructor here.
"""So, inside the Employee class, type:  public space Employee  within brackets String name, String email_address ."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: this dot name is equal to name semicolon , this dot email_address is equal to email_address"""
"""Now, let us comment the setter and getter methods."""
"""Inside the getDetails() method-  instead of getName, type name , instead of getEmail, type email_address."""
A subclass inherits all of the methods and variables from a parent class.
Note that it does not inherit constructors.
"""But, constructors can call the non-private constructors of its superclass."""
We do this using the keyword super from the child class constructor.
We will see that now.
"""For that, come to the Manager class. We will include a constructor here."""
"""So, type: public space Manager within brackets String space  name comma String space email underscore address comma String space dept ."""
"""Then, within curly brackets, type: super within brackets name, email underscore address semicolon."""
Then type: department is equal to dept semicolon.
Here we will comment the setter and getter methods.
"""Then, in the getDetails() method type: department instead of getDepartment."""
"""Now, come to the TestEmployee class."""
Comment the call to the setter methods.
"""Now, inside the call to the Manager constructor, type: within quotes Nikkita Dinesh,  abc@gmail.com, Accounts."""
"""Now, run the program."""
We get the output as shown. We get the Manager details.
"""In this way, we can call the constructor of the super class."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt: the super keyword  ,calling the method of the super class and  invoking constructor of super class."""
As an Assignment-Open the previous assignment. Call the Vehicle class run method in the Bike class.
The output should be: The Vehicle is running. The Bike is running safely.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Align and distribute objects using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:"""
Align and distribute various objects
Arrange objects in rows and columns
Set spacing between objects and  Create a tile pattern.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.48.4"
Go to Dash home and type Inkscape.
Now click on the logo.
Let me open an already saved Inkscape document.
Here we can see 5 different shapes placed randomly on the canvas.
"""On your Inkscape canvas, please draw 5 shapes and place them as shown here."""
"""Now, let us start aligning the objects."""
Go to Object menu and click on Align and Distribute.
The Align and Distribute dialog box opens on the right side of the interface.
Two types of positioning are available here.
Align is where the centers or edges of objects are aligned to one another.
"""Distribute is where objects are distributed in horizontal or vertical direction, based on their centers or edges."""
We can align objects in various manners using these options and their sub-options.
Here is another important feature: Relative to.
"""Using this, we can align the objects with reference to something."""
Click on the drop-down list to see the options here.
"""So, we have Last selected, First selected, Biggest object, Smallest object, Page, Drawing and Selection."""
"""By default, the objects will be aligned relative to Page."""
"""This means that the selected objects will respond to the Align and Distribute operations, according to your Page dimensions."""
Press Ctrl + A to select all the objects on the canvas.
The first 5 icons will align objects in the vertical direction.
Let me click on the first icon.
"""As the tool tip says, right edges of the objects are aligned to the left edge of the anchor."""
"""Please recall, here the anchor point is page, as the Relative to option is Page."""
Notice that 2 objects are overlapped now.
Overlap may occur based on the closeness of the objects in the previous arrangement.
We can correct this by clicking the Remove overlaps option which is below the Distribute option.
"""Now, the overlap is removed."""
"""To adjust the gaps between the objects, both in horizontal and vertical directions, use the H and V options."""
"""Now, click on the options under Align and observe how the objects align themselves."""
Use the undo option CTRL + Z to understand the alignment better.
The tool tips are quite useful to help understand the alignment.
The last icon works only on texts. So we will learn about that in another tutorial.
"""Next, we will adjust the gaps among the objects using the Distribute option."""
"""Since the objects are in vertical direction, we have to use the last four icons under the Distribute option."""
Let me align them to the centre first.
"""Now, click on the options under Distribute and observe how the objects align themselves."""
"""Once again, use the undo option CTRL + Z, to understand the alignment better."""
Refer to the tool tips to help understand the alignment better.
"""Under Relative to, observe there is an option Treat selection as group."""
This  will align the objects as a whole group.
Click on the check-box.
"""Now,  click on the icons one by one  and observe the objects are aligned as a group, and not individually."""
Let us uncheck the box.
"""Now, the objects will be aligned individually."""
"""Next, let us align and distribute objects according to Last selected."""
Change the Relative to option as Last selected.
"""So, bring all the objects inside the canvas and place them randomly."""
Select the objects one by one. Select the circle last.
"""As before, click on the icons one by one."""
"""Since the last selected object is circle, observe the objects are aligned according to the circle."""
"""Likewise, you can try out all the options listed in Relative to and observe the alignment of the objects."""
"""We will learn about the advanced options in Align and Distribute dialog box, in later tutorials."""
"""So, let us close this dialog box now."""
"""Next, we will learn to arrange the objects in rows and columns."""
Go to Object menu. Click on Rows and Columns.
The Rows and Columns dialog box opens up.
"""Using this option, we can arrange objects in rows and columns giving necessary spaces."""
Arrange the objects randomly on the canvas.
"""Now, let us arrange these objects in 2 rows and 3 columns."""
"""So, change the Row parameter to 2."""
"""Observe- when the Row parameter is changed, the Column parameter changes automatically."""
Click on Arrange button at the bottom right.
"""The Align option helps to align the objects in the right, centre and left."""
Check it one by one and observe the changes.
"""We can set the space between the objects, for both rows and columns, using the Set spacing option."""
"""Now, change the space parameter as 5 for both row and column."""
Click on Arrange button.
Observe the space between the objects.
"""Now, I will show how to create a pattern using Align and Distribute"""
I have a new Inkscape file with 4 squares of different sizes and colors.
Select all and rotate the squares so that they look like diamond shapes.
Open Align and Distribute dialog box.
Click on Centre on vertical axis.
Click on Centre on horizontal axis.
A tile pattern is now formed on the canvas.
"""Using these options creatively, we can form many unique patterns."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learned to:"""
Align and distribute various objects
Arrange objects in rows and columns
Set spacing between objects and  Create a tile pattern.
Here are 2 assignments for you-
Create 5 circles having the following dimensions.
Arrange them randomly on the canvas and select all.
"""Using Align and Distribute, change Relative to option to Biggest object."""
Click on Align left edges.
Click on Centre on horizontal axis.
Create 6 squares of blue color and size of 100 * 100 pixels.
Select all squares and open Rows and columns.
Arrange them in 2 rows and 3 columns.
Set both vertical and horizontal space parameter to 20.
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on more on grep.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn"""
some more on grep commands
through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:"""
Linux Operating System and
GNU BASH version 4.2.24
"""Please note, GNU bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
As prerequisites-
you should know basics of Linux terminal.
You should be aware of grep.
"""For relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown: http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
We can match more than one patterns as well.
Then we have to use the hyphen e option.
I will use the same file grepdemo.txt.
"""Say, we want to find information for those who are either in civil or electronics."""
We need to type on the terminal:
grep space hyphen e space within double quotes electronics after the quotes space hyphen e space within double quotes civil after the quotes space grepdemo.txt
"""Say, you need to look into people whose title is choudhury."""
"""The problem is, different people spell their titles in different way."""
"""So, what is the solution?"""
"""In such cases, we can use hyphen e option with hyphen i."""
Type:  grep space hyphen ie space within double quotes chaudhury ('c'  'h'  'a'  'u'  'd'  'h' 'u'  'r'  'y') after the quotes space hyphen ie space within double quotes chowdhari ('c' 'h' 'o' 'w' 'd' 'h' 'a'
The output is displayed.
"""But, there can be many other ways in which we can write the names."""
How many hyphen e options can we give?
"""Obviously, there needs to be a better way and that way is through Regular expressions."""
A 'regular expression' provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text
"""such as particular characters, words or patterns of characters."""
There are a number of regular expression characters.
Let us see them one by one.
The character class-
It allows us to specify a group of characters within a pair of square brackets.
Only one out of this group of characters is matched.
Eg. [abc] would mean that this regular expression matches either a or b or c.
"""To match chaudhury, we may type at the prompt:"""
grep space hyphen i space within double quotes ch opening square-bracket ao closing square-bracket opening square-bracket uw closing square-bracket dh opening square-bracket ua closing square-bracket r openin
It still does not match choudhuree with double e.
If we want to specify a large range then we write:
First letter dash last letter of the range.
"""Suppose we like to match any digit, we simply write [0-9]."""
One out of this group of characters is matched.
The asterisk: The asterisk refers to 0 or more occurrences of the immediately preceding character.
"""For example, ab asterisk can match a,ab,abb,abbb etc."""
"""So, to match the students name whose name is Mira"""
We type at the prompt:
grep space hyphen i space within double quotes m opening square-bracket ei closing square bracket asterisk r a a asterisk after the quotes space grepdemo.txt
The dot regular-expression matches any one character.
"""Say, we want to search any words that are 4 letters long and starts with M."""
We would simply type:
grep space within double quotes M... space after the quotes space grepdemo.txt
"""Here, the space within the quotes is important as it would match 5 or more letter words."""
We may be specific about where in the line we want to search for our pattern.
It may be at the beginning of the line.
"""For that, we have the caret sign."""
"""Now, if we want to get those entries whose roll-numbers start with A."""
We know that roll is the first field in the file.
We type at the prompt: grep  space within double quotes caret-sign A after the quotes  grepdemo.txt
"""Similarly, to match a pattern at the end of the file, we have the dollar sign."""
"""To find stipends between 7000 to 8999, we have to write:"""
grep space within double quotes opening square bracket 78 closing square bracket ... dollar sign after the quotes space grepdemo.txt
Press Enter .
To match more than one pattern
To check a word that has different spelling
Character class The use of asterisk
To match any one character using dot
To match a pattern at the beginning of the file
To match a pattern at the end of the file.
"""As an assignment, list those entries that are 5 letters long and starts with 'Y'."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of GIMP.
"""Before I start editing this image, I want to tell you in brief about using RAW for your real photography."""
"""If I had shot this image in JPEG, I would have had 256 steps of brightness for encoding it."""
"""You can see it’s nearly black and white, a bit bluish greenish tint and basically it’s only gray."""
"""And with JPEG, you have 256 different values of gray -"""
zero for black and 255 for white.
And in this image there is no white and only a bit black.
So only a small space of this room is used.
I’ll show you how much later.
I had shot this image in RAW and my camera stores RAW images in 12 bit data format.
This is the image I have got out of the RAW converter after spreading the values and here I have 256 different values of gray and now I can start to edit the image.
"""In this image, there are more details saved as compared to the first one."""
This is the first image I remember and this one I have got after conversion.
The second image is a good base for doing post processing which results in a picture which has the mood of the 1st image but looks better.
Now I have opened the two images in the GIMP. So let’s  have a look at the histogram of the 2 images.
The histogram is hidden in the image dialog.
"""But we have 3 different ways of reaching the image dialog, first way is on the tool bar."""
Second way is to click on Access  the image menu here and  click on dialogs.
"""And the third way is simply right click into the image, then Dialog and Histogram."""
Here’s the histogram of the first image.
Make it a bit bigger and here you see the distribution of different pixels of the different colors in the image.
Digital image is similar to painting by numbers.
"""When you zoom into the image, you see a lot of little tiles and each of these tiles has a different color which is called as a 'pixel'."""
And each color is defined by a value and I can show you these values here with the help of Color Picker.
"""When I use colour picker, I get the values for red, green & blue."""
"""In this image, the value of red is a bit less than green and blue."""
Green and blue have nearly and exactly the same value.
Painting by numbers is digital photography.
"""In this image here, I have numbers from 0 to 255 and we have a really dark part here but I don’t think it will make into the final image."""
"""I think, the real part of the image starts here  around 80 and the brightest part of the image is here at around 200."""
"""So, we have room from 0 to 256, but we only use 120  which is less than half of data which we could use."""
"""And because of that, a lot of information of the image is lost here."""
Let’s have a look at the histogram of the second image.
"""As we can see here, there is more data in this histogram as compared to first one but the form of the curve is identical."""
You compare these two histograms.
Details in the 2nd image is spread out. So the problem I have to solve here is to make the 2nd image compressed like the 1st one.
But it should have a bit more of  details and it should have a bit more of contrast like this one in the first image.
"""Before I start working with this image, I want to show you a thing that I found out about the GIMP user interface while recording the last tutorial."""
"""When you press tab into the image window, the tool-box here vanishes and helps me in getting the image as big as possible and I can switch the tool-box 'On' and 'Off' as per my requirement."""
So I can see it better what I am doing here and you can also see it better.
"""Before I start editing the image, I have to change some settings."""
"""So, I go to File, Preference and here I go to Window Management and choose the option here,"""
Keep above for the toolbox and Keep above for the docks and leave the rest of options as it is.
"""After I press OK, the GIMP works as advertised."""
I can select the tools from the tool box and get all options of the tool I have  selected.
I can click back into the image and use tab to switch the tool box on and off.
The first thing to do is to check if the image is leveled.
"""In this image, there are no reliable man made structures here. So I can’t use the grid method to check if the image is straight ."""
The surface of the water is a very good clue.
But we don’t see the horizon here and the streaks on the water are also a bit misleading.
"""This, here, is not the horizon but just a curve in the river."""
"""So, I don’t have a real clue where to set a ruler and check the horizon."""
I just have to rely on my eye which I don’t think is the worst way to do something in photography.
"""Now, I select the Rotate tool and I choose Normal Forward instead of Corrective Backward and I set in Preview as Image and not the Grid."""
"""Ok, click into the image."""
"""Here, in the center, there is a point called """"center of rotation"""" and around that point the image will be rotated."""
And here is the dialog where we can set the Angle about which we want to rotate the image.
Here I have a slider which can help me in rotating the image but you can see it is difficult to handle and I don’t think I have to tilt the image this much.
So let’s go back to zero here and now I just use the style here to rotate the image.
"""I think the image is bit tilted towards the right. So I have to rotate the image to the left i.e. counter-clockwise, so I have to get here negative values."""
"""So, I keep on changing the Angle till I get the correct and straight image."""
"""So, I set the angle for """"-0.25°""""."""
Pull this window in and click on rotate and wait for the result of this operation.
"""Next step: """"cropping""""."""
"""In the image, I want to have the ship, the water and these birds here."""
"""And I don’t want to have in the image is this grass here, this part here and I m really not sure if I want to have this bank of the river in my image."""
And I think I will crop this part of image because later I want to have the darkest part of the image.
"""i.e the birds here, the ship and then the trees, the bank behind the ship, and lastly the water and sky."""
And this part of the image is too dark.
I want to zoom into this part of the image as I want to include as much as possible the part of the river but nothing of the bank.
"""So, I zoom into the part of the image here by pressing the hot key Z."""
Here’s another bird flying.
"""So, I go to the left side and I pull over the ruler close to the bank and leave it here."""
And press Shift + ctrl + E which brings me back to the image.
Now I have to select the Crop tool and set some options in it.
I want the Fixed aspect ratio 2:1.
"""And in Preview, I set Rule of thirds for little bit of help which will provide me some helpful lines."""
"""Let me see, what all is included here."""
"""Here, it is a group of birds and single bird appears here."""
Now you can click the rulers away.
"""On the lower part of image, there is water but I think it’s not enough water in it and too much sky is included."""
I can lose this single bird up here because I want this group of birds to stay in the image.
Now I simply pull this down and I think this looks quite nice.
"""To check my work, I select Rule of thirds."""
"""My eye isn’t so bad because I divided the image into 3 different parts i.e the water, the trees and the sky."""
The ship is one of the point of interest.
This group of birds is second point of interest and this one is nice 1/9th of the image.
I think this will work; so I click into the image to crop.
Press tab and shift + ctrl +E to enlarge the image.
"""I think we have started very well with the cropping of the image and what else to do with this image, I will show you in the next tutorial."""
"""Before I say good bye, I should save the image which I should have done much earlier."""
I save the image as Fog.xcf and ‘xcf’ is the extension of GIMP’s own file format and it contains lot of helpful information of layers and undo information and much more from the GIMP.
I would like to hear from you.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on methods in  java.
To create a method.
And to call a method.
"""Here we are using,Ubuntu version 11.10"""
Java Development kit 1.6 and
Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know how to write, compile and run a simple java program in eclipse."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
A java method is a collection of statements that performs a specified operation.
Let us now write a method.
"""So, in the eclipse, I have already created a project Methods."""
"""In the project, I have created a java class named MethodDemo."""
"""In the class, outside the main method, we will write a method."""
"""So, type: void name of the method"""
Let us name it as displayMessage parentheses Enter.
And curly brackets.
A method can  return a value.
But if you don’t want the method to return a value then the keyword void is used.
"""Alright, now inside the curly brackets, let us print a message."""
"""So, type: System dot out dot println Hello Method."""
"""So, we have written a method."""
"""Now,  we will call this method."""
"""So, inside the  main method,  we will  create an object of the class MethodDemo."""
"""So, MethodDemo object name."""
Let's name it as md =new  MethodDemo parentheses semicolon.
"""So, we have created an object md of the class MethodDemo using the new operator."""
"""Now, let us call the method displayMessage."""
"""So, type: md dot displayMessage();."""
The 'dot' operator is used to call the method.
"""Now,  let us Run this application by clicking on Run icon."""
We see the output Hello Method on the console.
"""Now, let us return an integer  instead of void."""
"""So, type: int."""
"""Also, make the method public, that is accessible everywhere."""
"""By default, it is private, that is accessible only within the class where it is written."""
"""Now, inside the method, type return seven semicolon."""
Remember that we write  the return  statement  at the end of all statements in the method.
This is because after return statement no other statements are executed.
"""Now, inside the main method, at the end, type the 'print' statement."""
"""So, type: System dot out dot println();"""
"""Within parentheses, we will call the method."""
"""So, put md dot method inside the parentheses, remove the semicolon."""
This will print the return value of the method.
Run the application.
"""We see in the output, the value 7 is printed."""
Now we will write another method and call this method in displayMessage.
"""So, type: public void  method name  square  within  parentheses  int a."""
"""Here, we are giving int a as a parameter to our method."""
"""Now, within curly brackets type: System dot out dot println within parentheses a into a."""
"""So, we have written a square method"""
that will display a square of an integer which is  given as a parameter.
Let us call this method in the displayMessage method.
"""So, type: square within parentheses an integer 5 semicolon."""
Run this application.
We see that the output displays the square of 5 that is 25.
"""Now, let us understand the flow of the application."""
The starting point is the main method.
"""In the Main method, we have first called the displayMessage."""
"""So, the control goes to the displayMessage"""
and all the statements in the displayMessage are executed.
The first one is the print statement.
Then it comes across the square method.
So the control jumps to the square method.
The square method takes an integer 5 and returns the square of the integer i.e. 25.
Then the control goes back to the displayMessage.
And it returns the value 7.
Then the control jumps back to the main  function.
"""Since there are no statements left to execute, in the main method, the application terminates."""
Alright! Now let us  make displayMessage as static.
"""So, after public type static."""
We see that we cannot call a 'non static' method inside the static  method.
"""So, we will comment this call."""
"""Since main is a static method, we can call the static  displayMessage inside this."""
"""Now, for static method, we do not need to create  an  object."""
"""So, we will comment this object creation."""
Also  we will delete md.
Run the application.
We see the output Hello Method and 7.
We do not see  25 because we have commented the call to square method.
We can also call method from other class.
"""For that, I have created a class Demo."""
"""Inside the class, create a method."""
"""So, type: public void show parentheses Enter."""
"""Inside curly brackets, System dot out dot println"""
I am from other class.
Save the file.
Go back to MethodDemo class.
"""Now we will call this show method, inside the method MethodDemo class."""
For that we need to create the object of the class Demo.
This is because the  show  method belongs to the class Demo.
"""So, type: Demo d=new Demo parentheses semicolon."""
Then call the method show.
Lets Run this application.
We see on the console: I am from other class.
This is how methods are used in java.
The method name and the parameters form the signature of the method
while  the curly brackets and the statements form the body of the method.
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
To create a method
To call a method
And different signatures of methods.
"""For self assessment, create a method which prints the cube of an integer."""

We have come to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Introduction to Arrays.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how  to create arrays and  access elements in arrays."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10 JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of data types and for loop in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown."""
Arrays are a collection of data.
"""For example, a list of marks, a list of names, a list of temperatures, a list of rainfall."""
"""Each item has an index, based on its position."""
The index of the first element is 0.
The index of the  second element is  1 and so on.
Let us now see how to store this data.
So switch to Eclipse.
A class named ArraysDemo has already been created.
"""Within the main method, let us add the rainfall data."""
"""So, inside main function, type:"""
"""int rainfall open  and 	close square  brackets equal to within curly brackets type 25, 31, 29, 13, 27, 35, 12 and finally the semicolon."""
Note that the square braces after the variable name rainfall.
This declares rainfall as an array of integers.
The braces are used to specify the elements of the array.
Let us now access data.
"""So on the next line, type:"""
System  dot out  dot  println rainfall in square brackets type 2.
We are printing the element with the index number 2.
"""In other words, the third element in the array i.e. 29."""
Let us save and run the program.
"""As  we can see, the output is the third element, i.e 29."""
"""Now, let us type 0 in place of 2."""
Save and run the program.
"""As we can see, the output is the first value i.e 25."""
"""Now, let us modify the value of the first item."""
"""So, type: rainfall[0] = 11;"""
"""Now, let us see its value. So save and run the program."""
"""As we can see, the value has been changed to 11."""
"""Now, what if we  know only the size of the array and do not know the values."""
Let us see how to create such array.
Remove everything in main function and type:
int squares[] = new int[10];
This statement creates an array of integers having 10 elements. The name of the array is squares.
"""Now, let us add some values to it."""
"""So, type:"""
squares[0] = 1;
"""Next line, squares[1] = 4;"""
"""Next line, squares[2] = 9;"""
squares[3] = 16;
"""So, we have entered the squares of first four numbers."""
Now what about the other elements of the array. Let us see what they contain.
"""So, we shall print the sixth value in the array."""
Type: System S capital .out.println(squares[5]);
Save and run the program. We see that the value is zero.
"""This is because when we create an array of integers, all the values are initialized to 0."""
"""Similarly, an array of floats will have all its values initialized to 0.0."""
"""It would be a long process if we have to type each value into the array. Instead, let us use a for loop."""
"""So, type: int n, x ; for(x = 4; x  < 10; x = x + 1){ n = x + 1; squares[x] = n * n; }"""
"""So, we iterate over numbers from 4 to 9 and set the corresponding element in the array."""
"""Now, let us see the output."""
"""As we can see, we are printing the  value of sixth element in  array. So, Save and run."""
We see the sixth element is now square of 6 which is 36.
"""In fact, now we can set all the values inside the for loop."""
Remove the lines that set the values manually and change 4 to 0.
"""This way, all the elements from index 0 to 9 are set to the corresponding squares."""
We shall now see the value of the third element.
"""So, change 5 to 2."""
Save and run.
"""As we can see, the value of the third element has been set in the loop and it is 9."""
"""This way, arrays can be created and used."""
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
To declare and initialize an array.
And access an element in an array.
The assignment for this tutorial is:
"""Given an array of integers, find the sum of all the elements in the array."""

Choose the minute and second where you have the question. Explain your question briefly.
Someone from our team will answer them.
"""Welcome to Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
Today I have something new to show you.
There is a new video by Joseph and today he is going to show you how to make an image using the sketch effects.
Hi! My name is Joseph and today I am going to show you how to create a sketch effect using gimp 2.4.
"""To show you the sketch effect, I am going to work with the Layers."""
"""The next thing that I am going do is to rename these layers, So that I can get an idea about which layer I am working on."""
"""So, I select the top layer and then go to Filters >> Blur >> Gaussian Blur."""
I move around in the image with the help of the Preview to get a spot where we can see some lines.
And Blur Radius is very important here.
I have created 2 previews here to show you the differences you  get using 30 Blur Radius and 5 Blur Radius.
"""For this image, I will keep the Blur Radius as 15 and click on OK."""
Now we have got a nice blur on the top layer.
"""So, the next thing we need to do is to invert the colours."""
"""So, go to Colours >> Invert."""
"""Now we go back to our tool box, select the top layer and set its Opacity to 50%."""
And we get a nice gray image.
Now we will merge these two layers together by right clicking on the top layer and select Merge Visible Layers and click on Merge.
The next thing I want to do is to increase the contrast in the image and to do that I select the Levels Tool.
As you can see that most of the information in this image is in the middle.
And I have to slide the sliders to that value.
Now I slide the middle slider to the left so that I get the image a little whiter.
and click on OK.
And now you can see that the lines are started to come out but we still got some colours in the image.
"""So, I go to Colours >> Desaturate and select Luminosity option and now we have got a black and white image."""
"""Now, I select again the Levels Tool and adjust the slider to get more contrast in the image."""
Adjust the sliders in such a way that you get a good contrast in the image.
I think this is good.
"""So, now we have got an image with a good sketch effect."""
I think we should make a border to this image.
"""So, I create a new layer, name it as white and select Layer Fill Type as White and temporarily I decrease the value of opacity so that we can see through the image."""
Now I select Rectangle selection tools from the tool box and draw a rough selection into the image.
And adjust the rectangle.
"""Once we are finished with adjusting the rectangle, go down to the left corner and click on Toggle Quick Mask and we get a black and  white border which can be edited."""
"""We can use Filters to create some interesting effects. So, I go to Filters >> Distorts >> Waves."""
And in this box you can see that there are lots of options for creating some interesting borders.
I adjust the sliders so that I get a little wave.
That looks good.
Now I want to add some Blur.
"""So, go to Filters but I think I should use some different effect."""
"""So, I go to Noise and choose Spread and I set the Horizontal to 22."""
"""So, now go to the Toggle Quick Mask button and click on it."""
"""And you can see here, there are margins area which means that we got a selection."""
Now I am going to add a layer mask to that layer and fill it with white for full opacity and there is a selection in the image. We can drag black colour into that selection and make our area there completely
"""I go to Select >> None, go back to the layer that we had temporarily set transparent and we will increase the opacity to 100%."""
"""Later on if you want to change the colour of your border, all you have to do is to go to the Colour dialog, select a colour and drag in that layer and you get a different coloured layer."""
That was a nice sketch effect and thank you Joseph for this video.
Now let’s look what has happened there.
I have prepared here an image and I have here a gray gradient from black to white and a area filled with white and black.
And I have already doubled the layer which is the first step.
"""Now I want to invert this image. So, go to Colours >> Invert."""
You see that this image is now exactly the opposite and I reduce the Opacity to 50%.
"""And the whole image is gray that’s because, half of black plus half of white gives gray."""
"""And here, half of white plus half of black also gives gray."""
"""So, next step is to Blur this layer."""
"""So, go to Filters >> Blur >> Gaussian Blur."""
I have unblocked this chain here so that I can change only the Vertical blur and not Horizontal blur because the image will get very confusing.
"""So, this is my desired result and I click on OK."""
Now you see here dark gray and light gray lines.
These lines here are the result of blurring of the foreground.
"""When I zoom in here and enhance the Opacity you see here black, white and in between there is a gradient."""
On the other layer we have white and black and now it’s not the exactly opposite.
"""So, decrease the Opacity and now you can see that on one side it's dark gray and on the other side its medium gray."""
Here it's medium gray and here also.
But first let’s look at the trick of the eye.
"""Here it's definitely darker than this one here. So, I select the Colour Picker and we can see that here it is 128, 128, 128 for Red, Green and Blue and 50% gray and it's medium gray and here it's 127, 127, 1"
"""Here, there are little shades which is basically the same colour and we have 127 on this side and 128 on this side."""
If we divide 255 by 2 we get either 127 or 128 if you have no floating point.
"""Now, I have to merge these layers."""
"""So, go to Layer >> Merge down."""
"""So, here get the colour level that Joseph  had in his image and now I can just pull these sliders and make black darker and gray whiter."""
You can see a line of variable thickness and if I pull these sliders to left then line gets finer and finer.
"""So, let's look at the whole image, Shift + Ctrl + E and you see here I have lines instead of the gradient and colour fills I had before."""
I hope you  understand this and you can try doing it.
Some images look very good with this effect.
And Joseph’s image was so funny. I love it.
This week I start a new segment at Meet The GIMP.
If you go to the Home page and down there on the right side you find the way to 'Photo group at 23HQ.com'.
And there are lot of your images which I show and from week-week I will  take one of them and say something about it and today I will take this one here.
It is made by Mainzelmann at the fireworks and he asks for comment regarding the white balance and the colours in this image and I think its worth looking it.
I have commented but that was only in German.
Ok. Let’s have a look.
This is his image simply pulled off from the website and dropped here on the tool box and then GIMP opens the image from the web.
I think the sky has to get little darker.
"""The building here at the bottom is great, that has to stay in the image. But the sky here should be nearly black, not really black like this and perhaps some of this smoke clouds here can be saved."""
"""So, I select the Curves Tool and let’s see what we can do."""
"""You can see here that we have a lot of white colour in this image, here."""
"""The exposure in this image is very good and the values are very well distributed in the histogram and we have black here, you see that's not really black."""
We can make this a bit darker here.
"""So, I can pull this black point up to here."""
The black point is definition of black and I now can say this is black.
"""So you can see that it's the firework, a bit more prominent and I want to make this part of the histogram a bit darker."""
"""So, I place a point here and just pull the curve down."""
I have to leave a bit of room here for the building.
I think this is the important part of the building.
"""So, I pull the curve down here and I can see the building is still there."""
"""Now, this area here is dark and this white; perhaps this is now a bit too white. So I just pull this down."""
Let's try something strange.
"""No, that doesn't work."""
Just pull the points out.
I haven't tried this before so little bit of experimenting.
I think this works.
At first looking at the image to make it a bit warmer but now the colours come out very good.
I think this is it for this image.
"""For more information go to http://meetthegimp.org and if you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org. Good bye."""
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Redirection Pipes.
I am using Linux Operating System.
We assume that you already have an idea about the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands.
"""If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial on the following website."""
Also note that Linux is case sensitive .
Most of the work that we do in Linux is through a terminal.
"""When we have to execute a command, we generally type through the keyboard."""
Say we have to find the date and time.
We simply type through the keyboard date and press Enter.
"""So, we normally give input through the keyboard."""
"""Similarly, we see that the output of our command is also displayed at the terminal window."""
"""Also, say some error occurs while we are executing some command."""
For example we type cat space aaa And press enter.
"""Now, no such file by the name 'aaa' exists."""
"""So, there is an error displayed saying so."""
Now this error also comes on the terminal window. Hence we see error reporting is also at the terminal.
"""Now inputting, outputting and error reporting are the three special actions related to commands."""
Before learning about redirection we should know about two important concepts. That of stream and file descriptor.
"""A Linux shell like Bash, receives input and sends output as sequences or streams of characters."""
Each character is independent of the one before it and the one after it.
Streams are accessed using file IO techniques.
"""It does not matter whether or not the actual stream of characters comes from or goes to a file, a keyboard, a window etc."""
"""In Linux, every open file of a process is associated with an integer number."""
These numeric values are known as file descriptors.
Linux shells use three standard I/O streams.
Each of them is associated with a well-known file-descriptor.
stdin is the standard input stream.
It provides input to commands.
It has file descriptor 0.
stdout is the standard output stream.
It displays output from commands. It has file descriptor 1.
stderr is the standard error stream. It displays error output from commands. It has file descriptor 2.
Input streams provide input to programs.
"""By default, it takes from terminal keystrokes."""
"""Output streams print text characters, by default to the terminal."""
The terminal was originally an ASCII typewriter or display terminal.
But is now more often a text window on a graphical desktop.
We have seen that the 3 streams are connected to some files by default.
"""But in linux, we can change this default behavior."""
We can connect these 3 streams to other files.
This process is called Redirection.
"""Now, let us see how redirection is done in the 3 streams."""
"""First, let us see how the standard input is redirected."""
"""We redirect standardin from a file, using the < (left angled bracket) operator. Let us see how."""
"""We know that the use of wc command is to find the number of lines, words and characters in a file."""
Type wc on the terminal window.
Now press Enter. What happens?? We have a blinking cursor. It means that we need to enter through the keyboard.
"""Enter some text say """"This tutorial is very important""""."""
Now press Enter.
Now press Ctrl and d keys together.
Now the command will work on the lines that we entered.
The command will give an output on the terminal.
Now here no file is given after wc command.
"""So, it takes input from standard input stream."""
"""Now, the standard input stream is by default connected to the keyboard. Hence wc will take input from the keyboard."""
"""Now, if we write wc space left-angled bracket space test1 dot txt."""
"""What happens is that wc will tell us the no. of lines, words and characters in the file test1 dot txt."""
Now type: wc space test1 dot txt.
We see the same result.
"""So, what is the difference?"""
"""When we write wc space test1 dot txt , the command opens the file test1 dot txt and reads from it."""
"""But when we write wc space left-angled bracket test1 dot txt, wc still does not get any file to open."""
"""Instead, it looks to pick up the input from standardin."""
Now we have directed  standardin to the file test1dot txt.
Hence the command reads from 'test1'.
"""But, actually it is unaware as to from where the data is coming to standardin."""
"""So, we have seen how to redirect standard input."""
"""Now, let us see how to redirect standard output and standard error."""
There are two ways to redirect output or error to a file:
"""Suppose, 'n' refers to the file descriptor, 'n' single right-angled bracket redirects output from file descriptor 'n' to a file."""
You must have write authority to the file.
"""If the file does not exist, it is created."""
"""If it does exist, the existing contents are usually lost without any warning."""
' 'n' double right-angled bracket' also redirects output from file descriptor 'n' to a file.
"""Again, you must have write authority to the file."""
"""If it does exist, the output is appended to the existing file."""
The 'n' in 'n single right angle bracket' or 'n double right angle bracket' refers to the file descriptor.
"""If it is omitted, then standard output i.e. file descriptor 1 is assumed."""
"""So, just a right angle bracket is same as 1 right angle-bracket."""
"""But, to redirect error stream, you have to use 2 right angle-bracket or 2 double right angle-bracket."""
Let us see this practically.
"""From the last example, we have seen that the result of the wc command on a file or standardin is displayed at the terminal window."""
What if we do not want to display this on the terminal?
"""We want to store it in a file , so that the information can be later used."""
"""By default, wc writes its output to the standardout"""
"""The standardout is, by default, connected to the terminal window."""
Hence we see the output in the terminal window.
But if we can redirect the standardout to a file then the output from the wc command will be written to that file.
"""Say, we write:  wc space test1 dot txt 'right-angled bracket' wc_results dot txt ."""
Press Enter.
"""Now, to see whether this is actually happened, we can display the contents of wc_results dot txt by the c-a-t command."""
"""Yes! it has.Suppose, we have another file test2 in the same directory."""
"""Now, we again execute the command with test2 file. We type: wc space test2 dot txt 'right-angled bracket' wc_results dot txt."""
"""So, the contents of the file wc_results would be overwritten."""
Let's see this.
"""Instead, if we write wc space test1 dot txt 'right-angled bracket' twice wc underscore results dot txt"""
"""the new contents will not overwrite the already present contents of the file wc underscore results dot txt, it will be appended."""
Let's see this too.
Redirecting the standard error is done similarly.
Only difference is that in this case we need to mention the file descriptor number of standard error before the right angle-bracket  or double right angle-bracket sign.
"""Like we know that their exists no file by the name 'aaa', write the following wc space aaa."""
"""The shell will give the error: """"No such file or directory""""."""
"""Now say, we don't want error messages on screen. They can be redirected to some other file ."""
"""For this, we may give the command  wc space aaa space 2 'right angled- bracket' errorlog dot txt."""
"""Now the error will not show on the terminal, rather it will be written in the file 'errorlog dot txt'."""
We can see this by the command cat space errorlog dot txt.
"""Now, suppose that I make some other error by running the command: cat space bbb space 2 'right angled- bracket' errorlog dot txt."""
The previous error would be overwritten and the new error will show.
See cat space errorlog dot txt.
"""But, what if we want to list all errors?? Simple! we would run the command: wc space aaa space 2 'right-angled bracket' twice errorlog dot txt."""
We check this using the cat command.
"""We have seen how the three streams standard out, standard in, standard error are redirected and manipulated separately. But the real power of this concept can be gauged when we can manipulate the streams tog"
This process is called pipelining.
Pipes are used to create chains of command.
A Pipe connects the output of one command to the input of the next command in the chain.
It looks like:  command1 vertical bar command2 hyphen option vertical bar command3 hyphen option1 hyphen option2 vertical bar command4
"""Say, we want to know the total number of files and directories present in the current directory."""
What we can do? We know ls space minus l will list all files and directories of the present directory.
We can redirect the output to a file.ls space minus l 'right-angled bracket' files dot txt.
Run cat space files dot txt.
"""Now, each line is a name of a file or directory ."""
"""So, if we measure the total lines in this file, we can use 'files dot txt' to serve our purpose."""
This we can do using the command: wc space minus  l files dot txt.
"""Though this serves our purpose, there are a few problems."""
"""First, we need an intermediate file, here files dot txt."""
"""If the first command produces a lot of data, it may unnecessarily eat away the disk memory."""
"""Also, if we want to chain several commands, this method is slow."""
We can do it much easily using pipes like this. We write: ls space minus l 'vertical bar' wc space minus l
and we can get the same result with much more ease.
The output from the ls command goes as input for the wc command.
We can add even longer chains of command using pipes.
One common use of pipes is for reading multi-page displays.
Type: cd space slash user slash bin.
"""So, we are now in bin directory."""
"""Now, run ls minus l."""
"""We cannot see the output properly. But if we use it joined with a pipe to more, we can."""
Press Enter to scroll through the list.
"""Press """"q"""" to come out of it."""
These were some of the commands that help us to work with files.
There are many more commands.
"""Moreover, each of the commands that we saw has many other options."""
I encourage you to see more about them using the man command.
The best way of learning commands is to use them again and again.
This brings me to the end of this tutorial.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Nested if and Switch statements in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial we will learn,"""
how to use nested if statement and
switch statement.We will do this with the help of some examples.
"""Ubuntu operating system version 11.10,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
First we will learn how to write nested if and switch statements with an example.
I have already written the program.
Let’s have a look. In this program we will learn to check the range of integers.
Note that our file name is nested-if.c.
This is our Header file.
This is our  main() function.
Inside the main() function we have declared two integer variables 'x and y'.
Here we prompt the users to enter a number between the range of 0 to 39.
We take the value of y as input from the user.
This is our if condition.
"""Here, we will check whether y/10=0."""
"""If the condition is true, we print """"you have entered the number in the range of 0-9""""."""
This is our else-if condition.
Here we check that y/10 equals to 1.
"""If the condition is true,"""
"""we print  """"you have entered a number in the range of 10-19""""."""
In this else if condition we check whether the number is in the range of 20-29.
And here we will see that the number is in the range of 30 to 39.
This is our else condition.
"""If all of the above conditions are false,"""
"""we print """"number not in range""""."""
Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
"""To execute, type gcc space nested-if.c space hyphen o space nested. Press Enter."""
Type dot slash “nested” (./nested). Press Enter.
We see Enter a number between 0 to 39.
I will enter 12.
The output is displayed as:
you have entered the  number  in the range of 10-19.
Let us enter another number.
"""Let's execute again. Press the up arrow key, press Enter."""
I will give  5 this time.
We see the output as :
you have entered the number in the range of 0-9.
The conditional execution can also be done in another way.
By using switch statement.
Let’s see how it is done.
We will see  the same program using switch.
I have already opened the program.
Let's switch back to our text editor.
I have explained this in the previous program.
So I will move on to the switch statements.
"""Here, we divide the inputs i.e y  by 10 and the result  is  stored in  the variable x."""
That means the quotient will be stored in x.
With the help of the quotient we can identify the range of the number.
"""Here, we tell the switch command that the variable to be checked is x."""
This is case 0 . If case 0 is satisfied
then we print you have entered  the number in the range of 0-9.
We add break to come out of the loop if the case is satisfied.
We need to break the loop each time.
It is because only one condition can be true at a time.
This is “case 1”. “case 1” means “if the value of x is 1”.
We print you have entered a number in the range of 10-19.
This is   “case 2” .
Here  we print you have entered a number in the range of 20-29.
And this is case 3. Here we check whether the number is in the range of 30-39.
This is the default case. Default case specifies what needs to be done if none of the above cases are satisfied.
"""Here we print """"number not in range""""."""
And This is our return statement.
Let us execute the program.
Type gcc space switch.c space -o space switch. Press Enter.
Type ./switch(dot slash switch). Press Enter.
Enter a number between 0 to  39. I will enter 35.
The output is displayed as “you have entered the number in the range of 30 to 39”.
Now we will see how to execute the programs  in C++.
Switch back to the text editor.
Note that our file name is nested-if.cpp.
Here the logic and implementation are same.
There are a few changes like:
"""The header file as """"iostream"""" in place of """"stdio.h""""."""
Here we have included the using statement
Using namespace std.
And the  cout and cin function in place of printf and scanf.
You can see that the rest of the code is similar to our C program.
Let’s execute the code.
Type g++ space nested-if.cpp space -o space nested1. Press Enter.
Type ./nested1. Press Enter.
Enter a number between 0 to 39. I will enter 40.
The output is displayed as: “number not in range”
Now let’s see the switch program in C++.
Come back to our text editor.
Here also the logic and implementation are same.
You can see that the  header file is iostream.
Here is the using statement.
And we have changed the cout and cin function.
Rest of the code is similar to our switch.c program.
Let us execute.Come back to our terminal.
Type g++ space switch.cpp space -o space switch1. Press Enter.
Type ./switch1. Press Enter.
Enter a number between 0 to 39.
I will enter 25.
The output is displayed as:
“you have entered  the number in the range of 20-29”
Now let us switch back to our slides.
We will see the comparison between switch and nested-if statements.
Switch statement is evaluated according to the result of the expression.
Netsed-if statement is run only if the result of the expression is true.
"""In switch, we treat various values of the variable as cases."""
In nested-if we have to write the conditional statement for each value of the variable.
Switch statement can only check the integer values.
"""Nested if can check for both, integer and fractional values."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt * 'nested if' statement. e.g. else if( y/10 equals to 0)"""
switch statement. e.g. switch(x) and
Difference between nested-if and switch statements.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Java Interfaces.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Creating an interface"""
Creating  Implementation classes and  Usage of  Interface.
"""For this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 12.04 JDK 1.7 and Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
You should also have the knowledge of subclassing and Abstract classes in Java.
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
First let's understand what is an interface.
An Interface contains a set of abstract methods and static data members.
It defines the signatures of a set of methods without the body.
It is declared using the interface keyword.
Now we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called InterfaceDemo.
"""Here, we will create the necessary classes and interface to demonstrate the usage of interfaces."""
Right-click on src folder and click New > Interface.
Type the name as Animal and press Enter.
Note that the “interface” keyword is used for defining an interface.
Now type the code as displayed on the screen.
"""Here, the interface name is Animal."""
"""It contains three abstract methods talk(), see() and move()."""
All such methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract.
An interface can also contain constant variable declarations.
"""Here, the constant string value “Mammal” is assigned to the variable “type1”."""
And “Reptiles” is assigned to the variable “type2”.
"""All constant values defined in an interface are implicitly public, static and final."""
Next we will see implementation class for an interface with an example.
"""Here, Human is a class which implements the Animal interface."""
"""So, it must provide implementations for the methods talk(), see() and move()."""
A class can also implement multiple interfaces.
"""As shown in the example, the class Human implements two interfaces Animal and Action."""
Note that a comma operator used in the syntax is to identify the different  interfaces.
Now this class should provide implementations to all the abstract methods in both Animal and Action interfaces.
The figure here represents an implement relation.
The Animal class is an interface.
The Human and Snake classes are the two implementation classes.
"""The Human class provides its own different implementations for talk(), see() and move() methods."""
"""And, the Snake class provides its own different implementations for talk(), see() and move() methods."""
Let us understand the usage of interfaces with a sample program.
Right-click on the default package and create a class called Human.
"""Now, to make this an implementation class of Animal, type: implements Animal."""
"""Now, we can see an error comes up in the Eclipse IDE."""
This error indicates that we should provide an implementation to the Animal interface.
Let us see how to rectify this error.
"""Now let us define the methods talk(), see() and move()."""
"""So, type: public void talk( ) within curly brackets type System.out.println within quotes """"I am a human and I belong to""""."""
"""Now we can use the value of the static, final variable type1 declared in the Animal interface."""
"""So, type: + Animal.type1+ within quotes """"family"""" semicolon."""
Let us now implement the see() method.
"""So, type: public void see( ) within curly brackets type System.out.println within quotes """"I can see all colors"""" semicolon."""
We should also define the move() method.
"""So, type: public void move( ) within curly brackets type System.out.println within quotes """"I move by walking"""" semicolon."""
"""Note that the error disappears, once all the methods are implemented."""
Next we will see how to define the Snake class.
I have already created it in my project.
Please create the snake class in your project and type the following code as displayed on the screen.
Now let us go through the code.
"""We can see that all the methods of the Animal interface- talk(), see() and move() are implemented inside this class."""
"""Here, the talk() method prints “I am a snake and I belong to”."""
Then the value of Animal.type2 is to be printed and then “family”.
"""Here, the see() method prints “I can see only in black and white”."""
"""The move() method prints """"I move by crawling""""."""
"""Note that the Human class has its own implementations of talk(), see() and move() methods."""
"""And, the Snake class has its own implementations of talk(), see() and move() methods."""
"""Now, right-click on the default package, click new >  class and then type the name as Demo."""
"""Inside this class, we will have the main method."""
"""So, type main and then press ctrl+space to generate the main method."""
Type the following code as displayed on the screen.
"""In this line, we instantiate the  Human class using the Animal interface."""
This is represented as Animal h equals new Human();
Now we can invoke the different methods using this object as h.talk(); h.see();   h.move();
"""Next, we instantiate the Snake class using the Animal interface."""
Now we can invoke the different methods using this object as shown.
"""Now, let us run this Demo program."""
"""So, right-click on the class  Demo and then select Run as > Java Application."""
We can see the output.
"""These are printed by the talk(), see() and move() methods invoked using the human class object h."""
"""These are printed by the talk(), see() and move() methods invoked using  the Snake class object s."""
"""Now, let us explore the differences between an interface and an abstract class."""
All the methods in an interface should be abstract.
"""Within interface, there should not be any  constructors,"""
"""concrete methods,  static methods and main method."""
But an abstract class can have all these inside it.
The variables in an interface should be static and final.
There are no such restrictions for an abstract class.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about: * Creating an Interface"""
* Creating an implementation class and
* Usage of interfaces.
"""As an assignment, create an interface Vehicle which contains the methods brake() and run()."""
"""Create another interface Fuel which contains the following methods.   fill(String type,int quantity), pay(int quantity,int price)."""
Create a subclass Car which implements both interfaces Vehicle and Fuel.
"""Here, brake method should print """"Car Applies Power brake""""."""
"""And the run method must print """"Car is running on 4 wheels""""."""
Similarly fill() method can print the type and quantity of the fuel filled.
For example: 10 Litres of petrol.
pay() method can be used to print price to be paid. For example: Pay Rs. 640
Create another subclass Bike which again implements both the interfaces Vehicle and Fuel.
"""Here, brake method can print """"Bike Applies hand brake""""."""
And the run method can print “Bike is running on 2 wheels”.
"""Next, implement the fill() and pay() methods as explained earlier."""
Finally create a Demo class containing the main method to verify the results.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Special Effects on Text using Inkscape.
In this tutorial we will learn to create Reflected text Labeled text and Change the case of the text
"""To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS"""
"""All the previous tutorials in this series, were recorded in 0.48.4"""
"""From this tutorial, I will record in the version 0.91, which is the latest stable version."""
"""Let us open Inkscape.  First, we will learn to create a reflected text."""
Select the Text tool and type the word SPOKEN. Make the text bold.
"""Let me zoom in to the text, so that we can see the demo clearly."""
"""Now, go to Object menu and select Fill and Stroke option."""
"""Then, under the Fill tab, click on Linear gradient."""
Click on the gradient handles as shown now and change the gradient colors to red and blue.
"""Align the gradient vertically. So now, the gradient should be red at the top and blue at the bottom, as shown on the screen."""
Click on the Selector tool and press Ctrl + D to duplicate the text.
"""Now, press V on the keyboard, to flip the duplicated text."""
We can also use the option available on the Tool controls bar to flip.
"""Now, we will move the duplicated text below the original text such that it appears as a mirror image."""
"""Now, select the Gradient tool and click on the bottom gradient handle."""
"""Come back to the Fill and Stroke dialog box.  Here, we will change the Alpha value to 0."""
"""We will also move the bottom handle a bit, in the upward direction."""
"""Click on the Selector tool. Now, reduce the Opacity to 80 and press Enter."""
Our reflected text is complete now.  Zoom out a little to see it better.
"""Next, we will learn to create a labeled text."""
"""First of all, we will create a rectangle in green color. Since the Alpha value is zero, it is not visible now."""
Change it to 255 and press Enter.
"""Now, type the text “SPOKEN TUTORIAL” on the rectangle."""
Click on the Selector tool and change the size of the rectangle according to the text.
"""Next, select the text. Now, press Ctrl + D to duplicate the text."""
The duplicate text is exactly above the original text.
"""Change the color of the text to white, then go to Path menu and click on Object to path option."""
Now click on Object menu and then on Ungroup option.
Again go to Path menu and click on Union option.
"""On the Tool controls bar, click on Lower selection one step icon."""
"""Once again, go to Path menu and this time we will click on Linked offset option."""
Click on the handle that appears on the text and drag it to make the outline bigger.
Click on the Selector tool. Then click on the text and move it down.
"""Observe, there is another text created.  Select the text and delete it."""
"""Now, select the outline part and click on the Nodes tool."""
"""On the Tool controls bar, click on Convert selected object to path tool."""
"""Now you can see the nodes on the outline. Select the unwanted nodes in the middle and delete them, as demonstrated here."""
Click on the Selector tool again and move the text back to its original position.
Change the color of the text to green.
"""Select the outline part and press Ctrl + D to duplicate it. Once again, remember that the duplicate outline is exactly above the original."""
Change the color to black.
"""Then on the Tool controls bar, click on Lower selection one step icon three times."""
"""Lastly, in the Fill and stroke dialog box, decrease the opacity to 60 and increase the blur to 7."""
"""After doing this, we will make a hanger for the label."""
"""So, click on the Ellipse tool. Then press Ctrl key and draw a circle on the top left of the rectangle, so as to make a hole on the label."""
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the circle.And move the circle to the other end of the rectangle.
"""Next, click on the Bezier tool and draw a curvy line, as demonstrated."""
The line drawn should look like a hanger.
"""On the Fill and stroke dialog box, under Stroke style, change the width to 5."""
Now our labeled text is ready. Let us zoom out and have a better look at it.
"""Next, let us learn how to change the case of the text in Inkscape."""
Click on the Text tool and type alphabets on the canvas. Notice that the entire text is in lower-case.
"""Now, go to Extensions menu and click on the option named Text and then on Change Case. You will see some options."""
Let me click on the option UPPERCASE. Observe that the case of the text alphabets has changed to upper-case.
"""Again click on the text. Go to Extensions menu,  then on Text and lastly on Change Case."""
"""This time, select Random Case option.  Observe the change in the case of the text."""
You can try the other options on your own.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on User Roles in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to: assign admin role to a user,"""
assign a teacher to a course and  enrol a student in a course.
"""This tutorial is recorded using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04,"""
"""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30, Moodle 3.3 and  Firefox web browser."""
"""You can use any web browser of your choice. However, Internet Explorer should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
Learners of this tutorial should have some courses created on their Moodle website.
"""If not, please refer to the previous Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and login to your Moodle website using your admin username and password.
We are now in the admin dashboard.
Let us go to the Course and Category Management page.
"""Make sure you have these courses on your Moodle interface. If not, pause the tutorial to create them and then resume."""
Let us view all the users that we created.
Click on Site Administration.
Then click on the Users tab.
"""Under the Accounts section, click on Browse list of users."""
We now have 4 users.
Let’s click on the user Priya Sinha and edit her profile.
"""So, click on Edit Profile link in the User details section."""
Scroll down and locate the Optional section. Then click on it to expand it.
"""Notice that the fields Institution, Department, Phone and Address are populated. These are the ones we entered in the CSV file."""

"""To do this, go to the Course and category management page, as shown here."""
Click on 1st Year Maths subcategory to see the courses under it.
Click on the Calculus course. Scroll down to see details of the course. Click on Enrolled Users.
We can see that the user Priya Sinha has been enrolled to this course.
We did this through the upload user CSV.
"""In Moodle, everyone, including the teacher, needs to be enrolled to the course."""
The new role to be assigned to them depends on their current role in the course.
Click on Enrol users button either at the top right or bottom right.
A pop-up window opens.

Here is an assignment for you: Assign Rebecca Raymond as a teacher to the Linear Algebra course.
Assign Priya Sinha as a student to the Linear Algebra course.
Welcome to this brief tutorial on creating references using LaTeX and BibTeX.
What you first need to do is to create a database of references as in this file 'ref.bib'.
Let’s go down this file and let's go back to the top.
"""Each of these references begins with a unique key word. For example, the key word for this reference is KMM07."""
"""In the LaTeX file, let me open the LaTeX file, at the place where you want to use a reference, give the command 'cite key word'."""
"""For example- cite key word, cite keyword, Look at this, cite KMM07, the first reference we saw in 'ref.bib'."""
The next thing you have to do is to include the name of the file that has the references in the source file.
"""Here, I have included it towards the end of this document – 'bibliography ref'. Recall that the references are in the file 'ref.bib'."""
"""Finally, you have to say what bibliography style is to be used."""
That is included at the top of this source file.
This command 'bibliography style plain'.
"""Suppose that we use plain style here, the following sequence of commands is to be executed to create the references in the plain style."""
"""First, compile the source file using 'pdf LaTeX references'."""
Execute the command BibTeX references.
"""Third one, compile the source file, twice more, using pdf LaTeX references."""
Once. Twice.
"""The references are now created, let’s go and see."""
"""The second page, here is the text, here is the list of references. Let’s just go down."""
The plain style lists the references in alphabetical order and with numbering.
These numbers are used in the main text as well.
The referencing style 'u-n-s-r-t' is identical to the plain style but for one difference.
Put 'u-n-s-r-t' here.
References are listed in the order they are invoked first.
"""Let us change the plain to 'u-n-s-r-t', like the way we have done and then repeat the procedure of LaTeXing and BibTeXing. Which is, first, LaTeX the source file using pdf LaTeX, then BibTeX the source file"
Note what has happened now.
"""You can see that this has generated the references in the order they are cited in the paper. For example, this first reference is cited first here."""
Reference two is cited ‘2’ because it has been cited here.
It has been listed as second in this list.
Let’s just go down this list.
Okay. Let's come back.
"""To produce the references in the way the computer scientists use, change the style to 'alpha'."""
Let’s change this to 'alpha'.
"""Save and then repeat the LaTeXing and BibTeXing procedure. Which is, pdf LaTeX source file, BibTeX references, pdf LaTeX references once, twice. Note that."""
"""Now, we obtain this style of referencing."""
Let’s just go down this and see.
Okay.
There are many other styles of referencing. I have now downloaded two files: 'Harvard.sty' and 'ifac.bst'.
"""Make the following two changes. First, include 'Harvard' in the use packages command"""
like I do now and then change the style to 'ifac'.
Save the file.
"""Now, let’s do the LaTeXing and BibTeXing procedure once again."""
"""Latex, BibTeX, LaTeX once, LaTeX twice."""
We get the reference list as this pdf file.
Let’s just go down once.
It is alphabetically arranged but there are no serial numbers compared to the plain style.
The referencing is by author name and year; author name... and year.
"""In this style, there is a special command called cite-as-noun. That helps, put the name of the person cited in running text and not within brackets."""
Note that here we have used only cite and we have got all the references within brackets only.
"""Suppose for example,"""
"""look at this second paragraph.. The textbook by 'cite KMM07'. The textbook by.. the whole thing comes within the brackets. Suppose, I change this to 'cite-as-noun'."""
Save it and compile it.
"""As a result, now, this Moudgalya has come outside the bracket in running text."""
"""If you need some other referencing style, search the web."""
There are good chances that someone has already written the required 'sty' and 'bst' files.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Google Drive options.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the options available in Google Drive like:"""
"""Creating a document, a spreadsheet and a presentation"""
Uploading files & folders and
sharing options.
"""For this tutorial, you will need a working Internet connection and any web browser."""
I will be using Firefox web browser.
"""As a prerequisite, you should have basic knowledge of Gmail."""
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Gmail tutorials on our website."""
Let's begin.
Open the web browser and log-in to your gmail account.
I have already done so.
"""On the top right, we can see a grid icon next to our name."""
"""When we move the mouse over it, the help text says Apps.Click on this."""
This will show us a few google apps like: google plus Search YouTube Maps PlayStore News Mail Drive Calendar and More.
"""If we click on them, we will be redirected to the particular google app."""
We can also rearrange this list based on our preference by dragging the apps icon to any other position.
"""In this tutorial, we will specifically learn about Drive."""
"""So, let me click on  Drive."""
This will open the Google Drive page in a new tab.
"""At the top of the page, we can see a Search bar."""
"""On the left, there are some menus."""
"""And on the top right, there are some icons."""
"""In the center, we can see two files."""
The first one was shared with us during account creation by the Google team.
The second one is the file which we ourselves uploaded earlier.
"""Now, let us have a look at the left side menus."""
We have the following menus: New My Drive Shared with me Google Photos Recent Starred and Trash.
"""By default, “My Drive” menu will be selected and its contents will be displayed in the center."""
All the files and folders will be displayed in the center area.
"""So, we can see the PDF and the ZIP file that we had uploaded in the previous tutorial, here."""
"""The files which are created or uploaded by us, will also be stored under “My Drive”."""
The next menu is “Shared with me”. Let me click on this.
"""If any one shares a file or document with me, it will be displayed under this menu."""
"""As of now, no one has shared any file with me. So, this is empty."""
Recently google has created a shortcut link to access the Google Photos within the Drive.
We will skip this option for this tutorial.
The “Recent” menu will display the list of files or documents which were opened recently.
It will display both the “My Drive” and “Shared with me” contents.
"""So, here we can see the pdf and zip files because we had opened them earlier."""
"""Starred- If we have marked any file or document as Important, that file will be displayed under this menu."""
Let us go back to My Drive menu and right-click on our pdf file.
"""Now, choose Add Star option."""
"""Next, click on Starred menu. Here is our file."""
Let me make a copy of this file.
"""So, once again, right-click on the file and choose Make a copy option."""
Now we have two files.
Let us delete one of them. Select the file and press the  Delete key on the keyboard.
Deleted files or documents will be displayed under Trash menu.
"""The deletion is temporary, however."""
We can delete all the files permanently from the Trash menu by selecting “Empty Trash” option.
"""All the files in the “Trash” menu, will automatically be deleted permanently from the google server after 30 days."""
"""Now, let us learn how to create and upload files and folders."""
There are 4 ways to do this: The first way is to click on the red colored “New” button on the left.
The second way: Right-click on “My Drive” option.
"""Now, let us come back to My Drive. In the “My Drive” option, we can right-click in the center area."""
"""Lastly, click on the “My Drive” drop-down menu at the top."""
Let us explore with the “New” option. Click on New button.
"""It will display some options like: Folder File Upload Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and More."""
"""We will see each option, one by one."""
We can create a folder using the “Folder” option.
Click on it. Immediately it prompts us for a name.
Let us name the folder as “Spoken Tutorial” and click on Create button.
"""By default, this folder will appear under “My drive”."""
"""We can see it here, in the centre area."""
Folders help us to organize our files better.
"""So, we can create separate folders. For example- personal, work etc."""
"""To upload any file- first click on “New” button, then click on “File Upload”."""
This will open a file browser window.
Browse and select the file that you want to upload.
I'll select “xyz.odt” file from the Desktop and click on Open button.
"""At the bottom right, we can see the progress of the upload."""
This may take some time based on the size of the file and the internet speed.
"""Once completed, the uploaded file will be displayed in the center area."""
"""Now, close the progress window at the bottom."""
"""In the same way, we can upload a folder on the Drive using the Folder Upload option."""
This feature may be available in certain browsers only.  For e.g. Google Chrome.
How can we move our uploaded file into our Spoken Tutorial folder?
"""Simply drag and drop the file into the folder, like this."""
"""Now, on the left side, look at My Drive option closely."""
Notice a small triangle to the left of it.
Clicking on it will show the sub-folders under “My Drive”.
"""See, here is our folder “Spoken Tutorial” and here is the file     'xyz.odt' inside it."""
"""For our day-to-day work, we use documents, spreadsheets and presentations."""
Is it possible to create and manage them on Drive?
"""Yes, it is. In Google Drive, we can create- documents, spreadsheets and presentations just like in any Office Suite."""
"""So, we have  Google Docs for creating documents,"""
Google Sheets for creating spreadsheets
and Google Slides for creating presentations.
"""For demonstration purpose, I will only show how to create a document using Google Docs."""
"""To create a new document, click on New button and select Google Docs option."""
This will open an empty document in a new tab.
We can see that the menus and text formatting options are the same as in any other  Office Suite.
"""At the top, notice that the document is titled as “Untitled document”."""
"""This is an editable title. To rename the title, click on the text."""
“Rename document” window opens.
"""Here, we can type a suitable title for our document."""
I will type “My first google doc” and click on OK.
Notice the change in the title.
"""Next, let me type some contents here, say- “Welcome to Google Docs”."""
"""Any addition, modification or deletion made to this document will be auto-saved."""
"""Look for the message “All changes saved in Drive”, next to the 'Help' menu at the top."""
"""If we click on that, we can see the “Revision History” on the right."""
It has the last modified date & time and also shows who made the modification.
"""As of now, this document is not shared with anyone."""
"""So, we can see only one user “Rebecca Raymond” with the date as Today and the time."""
"""If this google doc is shared with multiple people,  the revision history will list all the changes made by each user, with a unique color for each user."""
We will see this feature a little later in this tutorial.
Close the “Revision History”.
Let me close this tab. The google doc will be automatically saved.
"""Once again, we are in My Drive and we can see our file here."""
Double-click on it to open it again.
"""Now, we will copy-paste the line “Welcome to Google Docs” twice and then close the tab."""
Double-click on the file once again to open it.
"""Again, copy-paste the line “Welcome to Google Docs” once."""
"""Now, click on “Revision History”. We can see all the revisions of the file along with the date-time stamp and the user information."""
If multiple revisions are not seen then click on “Show  detailed revisions” button at the bottom.
The revisions are arranged in chronological order with the latest revision at the top.
Click on each revision and understand how this feature works.
Let me now share this document with two other users.
"""For this, click on Share button at the top right."""
Share with others dialog-box appears.
"""In the People text-box, we have to give the email-ids of people with whom we want to share this document."""
"""So, I will type: 0808iambecky@gmail.com."""
Note that the auto-fill feature is available here for email-ids to whom we had sent the emails earlier.
There are three modes in which we can share the document with other users.
Click on the button here to see these three modes: Can edit Can comment Can view.
"""Can edit option gives the other users, permission to make changes in the document itself."""
"""Can comment option gives the other users, permission to suggest changes."""
"""Can view option gives the other users, viewing permission only."""
They cannot make or suggest any changes.
Let us give Can edit option to 0808iambecky.
I will also add: stlibreoffice@gmail.com.
Remember to use a comma separator between two email-ids.
"""As soon as we enter the email-ids, there is a change in this window."""
We get “Add a note” text area.
If we want to send some information about this document to other users then we can type it here.
"""I'll type  “Please find attached a document for testing purpose. Kindly modify or suggest as per the permission given to you. Thanks """"Ray.Becky”"""
"""Lastly, click on Send button to complete the sharing process."""
"""This will send an email notification with our message and a link to the shared document, to other users."""
"""Once again, click on the Share button."""
Then click on Advanced.
"""Now, for the user 'stlibreoffice', we will change the sharing mode to Can comment."""
"""Lastly, click on Save changes button and then on Done"""
and close this document.
"""Now, assume that both the users made some modifications in the shared document."""
"""When we open the document again, after some time, we can find the edits made by the other shared users."""
"""Since stlibreoffice@gmail.com had only suggest permission, we can see the suggestions given by that user."""
"""Move your mouse to the suggestion box, over the check and cross marks."""
The check mark says Accept suggestion and the cross mark says Reject suggestion.
Let me accept one suggestion and reject the other.
We can see a comment here from 0808iambecky.
"""And here, we can see a Resolve button."""
"""The users with Can edit option, can reply to that comment by clicking on the comment text."""
"""To remove the comment thread, click on Resolve button."""
We cannot see any of the modifications made to the document by 0808iambecky.
"""Recall, this user had edit permission in the document."""
"""So, how can we find out what changes were made by that user?"""
"""For that, we can check our Revision History."""
"""To open it, we will click on File and then on See revision history."""
We can see that 0808iambecky made some changes and this is seen in a different color.
We can also see the suggestions given by stlibreoffice@gmail.com in a different color.
"""And of course, being the owner, we will see our own work in a different color."""
Let us close the Revision History window now.
There is another way to share a document. Click on Share button.
"""In the Share with others window, at the top right corner, we can see the text Get shareable link. Click on it."""
It says “Anyone with the link can view”.
This will create a link to this document.
"""Now, we can send this link to any email-id which means that anyone who has this link can view the document."""
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to: access “Google Drive” Create and Upload files Create Google Docs and Use the sharing options."""
The video at the given link summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project. Please download and watch it.
"""We conduct workshops and give certificates for those who pass our online tests. For more details, please write to us."""
"""Spoken Tutorial project is funded by NMEICT, MHRD, Government of India. More information on this mission is available at this link."""
"""Dear friends, welcome to a spoken tutorial on the Linux Operating System."""
"""In this tutorial, we will study some basic commands."""
I am using Linux Operating System.
We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system.
"""If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial, on the website [1]."""
"""In this tutorial, we will see what are commands and what is a command interpreter."""
Then we will learn about how to find help in Linux using the man command.
"""Now the first question is, """"what are commands?""""."""
In simplest terms we can say that Linux commands are words that when keyed in cause some actions to take place.
"""Linux commands are seldom more than four character in length, like  ls, who, ps etc."""
The commands are in lower case and they are case sensitive. Let us see an example .
Go to the Applications menu.
Select Accessories and then click on Terminal from the available options.
Now we can see a prompt ($) and a cursor blinking next to it. This is where we need to type in a command.
Type the word who and press Enter.
We can see the name of the users logged in. Actually we have just executed a command called who which shows who are logged into the system.
But which entity is converting these commands which are nothing more than a few letters into actions?
"""This is the job of the Command Interpreter, also called the shell."""
"""We can define a shell as a program that acts as the interface between us and the Linux system,"""
allowing us to enter commands for the operating system to execute.
"""On Linux it’s quite feasible to have multiple shells installed, with different users able to pick the one they prefer."""
"""On Linux, the standard shell that is always installed as bin/sh is called bash, the GNU Bourne-Again Shell, from the GNU suite of tools."""
The commands we would be covering in this tutorial are generic and can run on most of the Linux shells with slight variations.
"""Nevertheless, we would be using the bash as the shell for demonstration in this tutorial."""
It is because bash is the most popular shell and portable to almost all UNIX.
"""Other shells include the Bourne shell which is the original  Unix shell, C Shell and the Korn shell."""
"""To see which shell we are using, go to the terminal"""
and type the command:  echo space dollar in capital SHELL and press Enter.
"""Normally, the output is /bin/bash which gives us the bash shell."""
There are ways by which we can activate different shells. Those will be covered in an advanced tutorial.
"""Commands are actually files containing programs, often written in C."""
"""These files are contained in directories. To find out where a command is stored, we can use the type command."""
Type at the command prompt:  type space ps and press Enter.
"""This shows that ps is actually a file, stored in the /bin directory."""
"""When we key in a command at the command prompt, the shell searches for a file matching the command name in a list of directories."""
"""If it is found, then the program corresponding to that file is executed, else a “command not found” error is given."""
"""The list of directories searched is specified by the PATH variable, as we will see later."""
"""For now, if we want to see this list, just type the command echo space dollar PATH  in capital."""
and press Enter.
"""Talking of commands, there is one important thing that we need to know."""
Linux commands are of two types: External commands and internal commands.
Now external commands are those which exist as separate files/programs.
"""Most commands in Linux are of this nature. But, there are some commands whose implementation is written within the shell and they do not exist as separate files."""
These are internal commands.
"""The echo command which we will see later, is in fact an internal command."""
Go to the terminal and type the command:
type space echo and press Enter.
"""The output shows: """"echo as a shell built-in""""."""
"""So, instead of giving a file name it shows that the echo command's implementation is internal to the shell. So, it is called internal command."""
Another important thing which we need to understand is the structure of commands.
"""Commands can be of one word or multiple words, separated by white spaces."""
"""In the second case, the first word is the actual name of the command while the other words are the arguments."""
Arguments can be options or expressions or file names.
A command can perform different tasks depending on the option specified.
They are generally preceded by a single or double minus sign called short and long option respectively.
Go to the terminal window and type the commands and see their outputs.
Type clear to clear the terminal window.
Then type ls and press Enter.
"""Again, type clear and press Enter."""
Type ls space minus a and Enter.
Type clear to clear the terminal window.
Now type ls space minus minus all and press Enter.
"""Again, type clear to clear the terminal ."""
Now type ls space minus d and press Enter.
"""At this point, it is enough to understand how the command's behavior changes with change of options."""
"""In Linux, we have a large number of commands"""
each of which have many different options.
"""Commands can also be combined together as we will see later. So, how do we keep so much in mind?"""
In reality you don't have to. This is because of the excellent online help facility available in Linux.
The man command provides documentation on just about every available command on the system.
"""For instance, to know about say- the ls command, all you have to do is to go to the terminal"""
"""and type man command with ls as argument, that is type man space ls and press Enter."""
Press q to come out.
"""man is the system’s manual pager. Each argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function."""
The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.
"""A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual."""
"""The default is to search in all of the available sections, following a pre-defined order and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections."""
You can use man command to know more about the command man itself.
Go to the terminal and type man space man and press Enter.
Press q to come out of it.
man command has many options.
"""Here, let me tell the most useful ones. Sometimes, we know what we want to do but we do not know the exact command. Then what can we do?"""
man provides the -k option which takes a keyword and returns a list of commands and their brief purpose.
"""For example, create a directory; we may not know the exact command."""
"""So, we can go to the command prompt and type man space minus k space directories and press Enter."""
Now we can search each of these commands to see what we actually need.
The same thing can be achieved using apropos command.
Type at the command prompt: apropos space directories and press Enter to see the output.
"""Sometimes, we do not need too much details. We only need to know what a command does."""
"""In that case, we can use the whatis command or man -f. Both give one line description about the command."""
"""Go to the terminal, type clear to clear the terminal window."""
"""Now, type: whatis space ls and press Enter."""
Some commands have many options. We may want to obtain a list of the different options that a command has.
Then we use the  - - (minus minus) help  option.
Go to the command prompt and type ls space - -(minus minus) help  and press Enter.
I will scroll up so that you can see all the options on this manual page.
"""That's it for this part of the Linux Spoken tutorial. Spoken Tutorials are a part of the """"Talk to a Teacher"""" project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""
More information on the same is available at the following link .
"""Welcome to the tutorial of Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""In the last tutorial, I showed something about the Drawing tools and some how the apply jitter button was lost."""
I remember doing that stuff but well it must have been gone during editing.
"""When I paint some lines here, you see it has a smooth corner and it looks like it is done with a pen."""
"""Now I Apply jitter and set the amount to let's say around half or so and you see, the paint brush jitters a bit and the border is not that even as it has been before."""
Let's increase the amount and now you can see the cloud of dots here which are distributed around the lines I have drawn.
And that’s the secret of the jitter button.
There is another correction to be made.
Hansen wrote to me that the Eraser tool has one important difference from the Pen or Brush.
"""To see it in action, simply paint something on a foreground layer, in transparency i.e with a Alpha channel on."""
"""A pen or brush with the background colour selected will paint in that colour but the Eraser will remove the colour, turning it transparent."""
"""Ok, let's try that."""
"""Black is my foreground colour and orange is my background colour and you can see the layer name is in bold, that means the alpha channel is not in the image."""
"""So, I switch on the alpha channel."""
"""So, let's select the Eraser."""
"""Here, my foreground and background colour are the same; so I pick the orange colour by pressing Ctrl+click as the background colour."""
"""So, basically we are painting with the background colour and now I On the alpha channel by right clicking on the layer and Add Alpha Channel and you can see the name is not bold anymore and now I select the"
You can see that foreground and background colour is erased.
Now I will tell you more about Paintbrush and the brushes you can select for painting.
"""So, let's talk about the brushes in this tutorial of Meet The GIMP."""
Brushes are used by a lot of tools starting with the Pencil and I think ending with Dodge and Burn tool.
"""All these tools in between, use a brush except for the Ink."""
"""So, now I select the Paintbrush as an example."""
"""You can select brushes either by clicking on the Brushes dialog or in the tool box, select the Paintbrush and click on the Brush option and you will get the set of brushes."""
"""There are small signs around here, the plus shows that the brush is not as small as shown here and when I click on that I see a big brush."""
"""This, the red triangle, is the animated brush."""
Let’s try this here.
It looks a bit like a pencil drawing and this is called pencil sketch.
The blue ones are parametric brushes.
They are basically mathematical mode which I will show you a bit later.
Here are some standard brushes.
"""In this brush, the black part is filled with the foreground colour. In this case, it’s black and the white part in these standard brushes is not changed. So, I can paint here."""
"""And, if I change my foreground colour to red then the small image will be red in my painting and this white will stay as background."""
"""There are some others brushes here, like this one, the pepper color brush."""
I can just put a pepper in here and even draw a line of these peppers.
This brush is not very useful but you can make your own brushes and there it can be very useful.
Here is a brush which is a very nice thing.
This is the vine and you can draw a line of vine which looks quite nice.
You can use it for little decoration.
"""Let's look at the strange brush here, in the front Clipboard."""
"""So, now I draw something but before that I should use black and white as my colours."""
"""So, now I select a square area around this painting and copy it with Ctrl+C into the Clipboard."""
"""For copying, I could have gone to Edit >> Copy or I could have right clicked and Copy."""
Now I select my Paintbrush here and I select the Clipboard dialog.
"""You see, here it isn’t working."""
I could only paint in this selection because this area is selected and this area isn’t selected.
"""So, I have selected this by Shift+Ctrl+A and now I can paint."""
"""You see here, my little flower pops up."""
You can even draw a line of the little flowers which is not very good because the background is also copied and each flower was overlaid by the other.
This will look nice if you just copy a little bit of an image and then drawing into the image where you want to have it.
You can use it for stamping your logos or  stamp a face of a person in a crude way in an image.
When I open the Brushes page here I can modify a bit about the brushes.
"""First thing here is Spacing and still I have my clipboard brush selected and when I go to 100% with the spacing, I can draw a line of lovely flowers."""
"""In this dialog, you can also make a new brush by just clicking on the first option here but this is editing option."""
"""So, click on the second option and here I can make a new brush."""
"""I can select a Shape either circle, square or diamond."""
Let's take the diamond. I can change this Radius and I can add some Spikes to the brush as well.
You can see that I can change the Hardness of my brush and make it softer or harder.
I can change the Aspect ratio also.
"""By changing the Angle of the brush, I can tilt it a bit and I can change the Spacing."""
"""Let's do that here. With this little star, enhance the Spacing to 200 or so."""
And now I am finished making a new brush and I call it star.
Now you can see in the Brushes dialog your new star brush.
And when you use it you get this kind of star.
"""Now, I only have to fill this up with black."""
Select Gold as your foreground colour.
Apply high amount of jitter to the star brush and stamp the star here.
I think the jitter is quite a lot and it doesn't look nice.
This was a very quick way of making a new brush.
I can edit this brush by selecting the first option and I can change the Angle a bit and turning it and now I can use it here.
I have changed the angle a bit so this works quite well.
You can do your own mathematically defined brushes by making a new brush.
The first option is just to copy something into the clipboard.
The last thing I want to show you in this tutorial is to get brushes from the net and that can be done simply by searching for GIMP brushes and I have here one example for you on deviantART by Iceytina.
Here are the available brushes that Iceytina has made and I can download them by selecting here Download.
And I save them to the disk.
I have downloaded it to my disk and I will install them in a moment.
"""So, let's look at this page and you can see that these brushes are licensed in the Creative Commons License and I am not allowed to  do derivative works with this. So, I am not allowed to take these brushes"
"""But, I may use them and work with them and even publish them on my website with attribution to Iceytina and the original link."""
You can see here that there is a link to GIMP Brushes and there are a lot more brushes on deviantART and on other web sites.
This is one of the newest and popular brush from last 24 hours.
I select 1 month and you can see now there are lots of different brushes.
And well! Let's take this Stardust and Twinkles.
But this is quite shocking.
KNUX’S Spike Brush Pack by Knux57.
"""Well, there is no license information here, so I can download it and I can work on it."""
I just click on Download.
Here you can see the folder opened of GIMP 2.4 brushes and here you can see 'star.vbr'.
I don't know about 'vbr' but 'gbr' are the standard brushes from the GIMP.
Here are the brushes made by Iceytina from that website.
I open this folder with my archive tool and you can see there are 'water colours' in 'jpg' and a lot of other files like 'README'.
"""So, let me just select them all and pull them over into the brushes directory."""
Here they are.
And I do the same with Knux Spike Brush Pack.
I open the folder with Archive manager and you see here GIMP brush files.
So I select them all and pull them over to my brushes directory.
"""Now I have all the brushes in my brush directory, so I close my Archive Manager and I close the folder here and get back to the GIMP."""
"""You can see that nothing has changed here but I can select this Reload Brushes. And now you see, I have lot more brushes and these brushes are from Iceytina, and now I can try them here."""
These brushes are like water colour.
"""So, I select a colour from the water colour box here and draw."""
These brushes can be used only for stamping and not for drawing.
These brushes have lots of jitter in it.
Let me first clear the background.
"""So, these brushes here are well for something like faking a water colour or you can use them to build a frame around the image."""
"""So, now let's look at the Knux brushes."""
I haven’t seen  them before and let's try that.
These brushes are big. It's again a thing for stamping
"""and quite different. When I paint with them, it's not that nice but when I increase the spacing and decrease the opacity it can be nice."""
"""If you need a border around something, it can be quite nice."""
But I think these brushes are made for graphical artists and not that useful for photographers.
But perhaps you will find a way to use them.
"""I think, I have covered a lot of things about the brushes and I will cover making an animated brush, image hose and making these colour brushes in another small edition."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on feedback diagram creation using Xfig.
"""In the spoken tutorial on block diagram creation, we created the diagram shown here."""
We will refer to it as the blocks tutorial.
Please master the blocks tutorial before starting the current one.
"""In this tutorial, we will explain how to create block diagrams of the type shown on this page."""
"""I shall use Xfig version 3.2, patch level 5."""
"""We will begin with """"block.fig"""" created in the blocks tutorial."""
"""Let us choose the File, then Open."""
"""In the entry box, we can enter """"block"""" and press Open. Or double-click on “block.fig”."""
"""Using the Save as option on File, we will save this figure as """"feedback""""."""
"""We now have the file """"feedback.fig""""."""
Let us put the grids on by clicking on the Grids.
The scroll bar on the right can be used to move the canvas up or down.
The role of each mouse button is shown on the top right hand side.
This role depends on the activity.
"""To illustrate this, let me take the mouse to the vertical scroll bar."""
Observe the comment next to the left button.
"""I cannot move the mouse to show this. It is because, the role of the buttons will change if I move the cursor away from the scroll bar."""
The left-button moves the canvas up and the right-button moves it down.
"""Instead of clicking the left or right button, we can also click the centre button, hold and drag the canvas up or down."""
"""In a similar way, you can move the canvas to the right or left, using the scroll bar on the top. Left, right.."""
"""I will now move the box to the centre by clicking the middle button, holding and dragging the canvas to the centre."""
"""As I release the mouse, the box gets moved to the centre."""
Let us now create the feedback diagram starting from this block.
Let us copy this box.
Click on the box and select it.
Move the mouse to the new location and click.
Let us now put some text.
"""Let us click the text-box, indicated by T, from the left hand side panel."""
Let us choose the size of the text.
Move the mouse to the value-box and enter 16.
Click Set.
Let us click the Text Just button in the attributes panel.
Let us choose the centre alignment.
Let us click at the centre of the first box.
"""Sorry, I did not choose the correct position."""
I will click at a different location to move the cursor away.
I will then click at the correct position.
Let us now type the text “Control” and click the mouse.
We would now want to enter some more lines with arrows.
Let us choose the POLYLINE button.
Let us select the Arrow Mode button from the attributes panel and select the second option.
Let us click the Arrow Type button and an arrow head.
Let us click at the point where we want the line to start.
Let us move the mouse to the end point of the desired line.
Let us now click there with middle mouse button.
The line is created with an arrow.
I want to place a circle.
Let us choose the circle on the left from the left hand side panel.
We will place it to the left of the first box.
"""Click the mouse. As I move the mouse, the circle becomes bigger."""
"""When we get the right size, let us release the mouse button."""
"""Oops, the circle is larger than what I wanted."""
"""I can undo this operation, using the Edit button at the top."""
"""We can also delete this object, using the Delete button on the left hand panel."""
Let us do that now.
A skeleton with cross hairs appears.
All key points of all objects also appear.
Move the cross hairs to a key point that indicates the circle and click.
"""In case a wrong object is deleted, no need to panic."""
"""You can undo it: Click the Edit button, hold, go to Undo and release the mouse."""
"""If some objects are closely placed, you may have difficulty in choosing them."""
You can solve this through the zoom feature.
"""Click the View button on the top left hand side, hold and choose one of the zoom options."""
Let me release the mouse at Zoom to fit the canvas.
Now it is easy to discriminate between the objects.
Let me delete the circle now.
Let me unzoom.
I will move the diagram to the centre with the use of scroll buttons.
I do not like to leave the delete symbol on because I can accidentally delete something else.
I can change this by choosing any other button.
Let me choose the left circle.
Let me redraw the circle.
I want to put another line from this line.
"""For this, we will first put a dot on the line."""
"""Let us click the Library, on the left hand side panel."""
The Library is indicated by a stack of books.
A dialog window opens.
"""Next to the Library, it says """"None Loaded""""."""
Let us click and hold.
A list of available libraries appears.
Move the mouse to the 'Logic' library and release the mouse.
Let us choose the small dot by double clicking on it.
The dialog window gets closed.
We see a cross hair along with the chosen small dot.
Let us place the dot on the line by clicking.
"""The cursor and the small dot show up once again, suggesting that we can place it at some other location also."""
We do not want to place the dot at any other place.
Let us close it by clicking the right button of the mouse.
The right button does an undo operation.
"""In this case, dot selection has been removed."""
Let us draw a line from this dot to the circle.
Let us select the Polyline.
Notice that the previous selections of Arrow Mode and Arrow Type have been remembered.
"""Within a session, Xfig remembers the parameter values."""
Click at the dot.
Move the mouse to the bottom and click.
"""Now turn the mouse to the left, until at the bottom of the circle. Click."""
Move the mouse to the circle and now click the middle mouse button.
"""Let us draw another line, to the left of the circle, by copying."""
Let us now save this figure using the File button at the top left hand corner of Xfig and choosing Save.
Let us now Export the file.
Let us click the File button once again and choose Export.
Let us choose Language and then PDF.
"""We get the file """"feedback.pdf""""."""
Let us open this file through the command open feedback.pdf.
We now have the block diagram that we wanted.
We have completed our objective.
We have an assignment for you.
Substitute the blocks with different objects.
Try out operations such as rotate and flip.
"""View the file """"feedback.fig"""" in an editor and identify different components."""
"""Using the Library, create entirely different block diagrams."""

We welcome your participation and also your feedback.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create and format text using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Inserting text Formatting and aligning text Spacing and bullet."""
We will also learn how to create a simple flyer at the end.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS Inkscape version 0.48.4"""
I will be recording this tutorial in maximum resolution mode. This is to accommodate all the tools that will be demonstrated.
Let us open Inkscape.
Text can be inserted using the Text tool from the Tool box.
We can add text in two ways- Regular Text and Flowed Text.
First we will learn about Regular Text. Click on the Text tool and then click on the canvas.
Type the word Spoken. Observe the text box grows to accommodate the text.
"""Line breaks have to be added manually. So, press Enter to go to the next line and type “Tutorial”."""
"""To move the word to the previous line, keep the cursor before the alphabet 'T'. Now press backspace and add a space between the 2 words."""
"""In a similar way, type: http://spoken-tutorial.org/ on a new line, below """"Spoken Tutorial""""."""
"""Next, we will learn to insert text through Flowed text."""
"""This time, I will copy text from a LibreOffice Writer file that I had saved earlier."""
Press Ctrl + A to select the entire text and press Ctrl + C to copy that.
"""Now, come back to Inkscape. Make sure the Text tool is selected."""
Click on the canvas and drag to form a rectangular or square text area.
"""Notice, a blue rectangle box is formed on the canvas on releasing the mouse button."""
"""Now, inside the text box, notice the text prompt which is blinking on the extreme top left corner."""
Press Ctrl + V to paste the copied text.
"""Observe, the color of the text box changed to red."""
This is because the inserted text exceeds the boundaries of the text box.
We can correct this using the small diamond handle at the right corner of the text box.
Click and drag it till the text box color changes to blue.
The last sentence of the text is clubbed with the previous sentence.
Press Enter twice at the beginning of the last sentence to separate it.
"""Next, let us learn the various formatting options available for texts. Click on the word “Spoken Tutorial”"""
Go to Main menu. Click on Text and then on Text and Font option.
A dialog box appears with two options – Font and Text. Under the Font tab there are several options.
Font family lists all the available fonts. You can select any of the available fonts of your choice.
We can preview the selected font in the preview box here. My choice is Bitstream Charter font.
"""There are four Style options- Normal, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic. Choose the style as per your requirement. I will choose Bold."""
"""To change the Font size, simply click on the drop-down arrow and select the size. Since this is the title, I will select a bigger font, say 64."""
Next is the Layout.
We will learn about this in a while as the preview is not visible for this option.
"""Now, click on the Text tab next to the Font tab. Here, a preview window is seen with the text inside it."""
Any modifications to the text can be done here.
Click on Apply and close the dialog box. Observe the text is now formatted.
We can change the text color using the color palette at the bottom. Let me click on maroon color.
"""Next, select the text for the URL i.e. http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Text formatting options are available in the Tool controls bar too.
"""I will change the font to Bitstream charter, Font size to 28 and color to Blue."""
"""Now, let us choose the paragraph text."""
"""If the Text tool is already selected, you can simply click on the text to go inside the text box."""
I will change the Font size of the text to 25.
Click and drag the diamond handle to move the text inside the canvas.
"""Next, let us align the texts."""
The four icons next to the Italic icon on the Tool controls bar help to align the text to the Left Center OR Right of the text box.
The fourth option will justify the text within the boundaries of the text box. I will click on left align before proceeding further.
We can align the text using the Align and distribute option too.
Go to the Main menu and then click on Object menu. Then click on Align and Distribute option.
"""Now, we will move the word Spoken Tutorial to the centre. So click on it."""
First check if the Relative to parameter is set to Page.
"""So, click on Centre on vertical axis. Observe the text is now aligned to the centre."""
Let us add some more text in the empty space at the bottom.
"""Type FOSS Categories. Now, align it to the centre of the page by clicking on Centre on vertical axis."""
"""Type some FOSS names such as Linux, LaTeX, Scilab, Python separately and randomly on the canvas."""
"""Now, let us align all these texts in a single row with equal space."""
Select the 4 texts using the Shift key. Click on Align baseline of text and Distribute baseline of text horizontally.
Notice the gaps between the words are not equal.
The first letter of the first word and the first letter of the second word are equally spaced. But the words themselves are not equally spaced.
This works in a similar way for vertical texts too.
These options may be useful in certain situations.
We will make the spaces between the words equal.
"""To do so, click on the fourth icon in the first row under Distribute. Now the spacing is equal between the words."""
"""Next, we will learn to adjust the space between the lines of the paragraph text."""
Double-click on the paragraph text to go inside the text box.
The Spacing between lines icon on the Tool controls bar helps reduce or increase space between lines.
Observe what happens when I increase the spacing.
Let me keep the line spacing as 1.50.
"""The next icon helps to adjust space between letters. Again, click on the up and down arrows and observe the changes."""
Let me keep the space parameter as 0.
Observe there is an empty space in both the vertical corners of the canvas. We can fill them with some text.
"""Type a sentence: """"Learn Open Source Software for free"""". somewhere outside the canvas."""
Change the Font to Ubuntu. Font size to 22 and make it Bold.
Now click on the last icon i.e. Vertical text on the Tool controls bar.
Notice that the text is now aligned in vertical direction.
Click on the text using the Selector tool and move it to the left corner of the canvas.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate it and move the copy to the other corner of the page using the Ctrl key.
"""Now, we will add bullet points to the text within the paragraph."""
Inkscape does not provide bullet or number lists for text. So one has to create bullet points manually.
Click on the ellipse tool. Draw a small circle of red color.
Now move this bullet to the first line of the paragraph. Duplicate it and move its copy to the next sentence.
Repeat this for all sentences.
"""Now, we have all our text as per our requirement."""
"""Lastly, let us do some beautification to make it look like a flyer."""
Here is the completed flyer.
I have added borders to the top and bottom. And covered the texts with a rounded rectangle and ellipse shapes.
You can use your creativity to create different layouts and designs for your flyer.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to: Insert text Format and align text Spacing and bullet lists."""
We also learned to create a simple flyer.
Here is an assignment for you-
Create a flyer like this. Use the text tool to type texts. Create bullets and boxes using the rectangle tool.
Create star using star tool with 10 corners. Use color palette and Fill and stroke to change colors. Align the text using Align and distribute.

Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Basics of System Administration in Linux.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn the following-"""
"adduser,su,usermod,userdel,id,du,df"
I am using Linux for this tutorial.
"""As a prerequisite, please go through the spoken tutorial on General Purpose Utilities in Linux   which is available on this website."""
One must have admin access in order to execute the commands shown.
Let us first learn how to create a new user.
The adduser command will create a new user login for us along with authentication.
We can add any user account with the help of  sudo command.
Let me give you a brief explanation about the sudo command.
Sudo command allows the administrative user to execute a command as a super user.
The sudo command has many options. We will learn about the options as we go further in this tutorial.
Let's now learn how to create a New User.
I have already invoked the Terminal here.
"""Here, type the command: sudo space adduser and press Enter."""
You will be prompted for a password.
I will give the Admin password here and Enter.
The typed password on the terminal is not visible.
"""So, we have to type the password carefully."""
"""Once done, a message  """"adduser : Only one or two names allowed"""" is displayed."""
"""So, let us create a new user account named duck."""
Type the command :
sudo space adduser space duck and press Enter.
"""We have created a new user called """"duck""""."""
"""In the process of creating a new user, a separate home directory for that user has also been created."""
Please note that we will be prompted for a new password for the user duck.
"""Type the password of your choice, in my case I am going to type """"duck"""" as the password and press Enter."""
Please type the new password again.
The password is asked twice for security reasons and for confirmation.
Now our password for the new user is updated.
We will be asked for other details too.
"""But for the time being, I will enter only the Full Name as """"Duck"""" and leave the rest of the details blank by pressing the Enter key."""
Enter.I will confirm this by entering “y”.
This is to confirm that all the information is correct.
"""Let us now check, if the user account has been created."""
"""To do this, please type at the command prompt:"""
ls  /(slash) home
and press Enter.
To show the list of users in the home folder this command is used.
"""And, here is our newly created user named """"duck""""."""
Let me switch back to the slides.
Now the next command is the su command.
su stands for Switch User.
This command is useful for switching from the current user to another user.
Let us go to the Terminal now.
Enter the command: su space hyphen space duck on the terminal and press Enter.
You will be prompted for a password.
"""I shall type the user duck password here, please recall that it was """"duck"""" itself."""
"""Please notice that, the Terminal switches from the previous user to the new user which is “duck” in our case."""
"""To logout from this user, type logout and hit Enter."""
Now the terminal logs out from the current user duck and comes back to the previous user account which is vinhai in our case.
Let us learn about the usermod command.
The usermod command enables a super user or root user to modify the settings of other user accounts such as:
Change the password to no password or empty password.
Show the date on which the user account will be disabled.
Let us try this command and see.
Let me switch to the terminal now.
Let me show you how to set a date of expiry for the user account duck.
"""Here, at the command prompt, type:"""
sudo space usermod space -(hyphen)e space 2012-(hyphen)12-(hyphen)27 space duck
and press Enter.
The user account expiry date is set as mentioned in the command here with the help of the option “-e”.
Now you have set an expiry date for the user account duck.
Let us now talk about the uid and gid commands.
id – command is used to check the identities of all the users and groups.
"""To know about the identity of the user, we use id space -(hyphen)u."""
"""To know about the identity of the group users, it is id space -(hyphen)g."""
Now let's work on this.
"""At the terminal, let us type id and press Enter."""
"""Now, we can see the User IDs and Group IDs on the system that we are using."""
"""To get only the user-id, we use “-u"""" (hyphen u) option."""
Let us type the command: id space -(hyphen) u
and press enter.
"""Now, we can see only the 'id's of the users."""
But what if we need to know the names of the users?
"""To find that out, we will type:"""
id space -(hyphen) n space -(hyphen) u on the terminal here and press Enter.
"""Now, we can see the names of the users instead of their 'id's."""
Let us now learn the commands for Group IDs.
Let's type:  id space -(hyphen)g.
Here we can see the group ids.
"""If we want to view all the current user's group IDs, type:"""
id space -(hyphen) (capital)G and press Enter.
Please notice that I have typed 'G' in capital letter.
See the result for yourself.
"""Now, let us learn how to delete a user account."""
"""For this, we use userdel command."""
We can delete an user account permanently with the help of the userdel command.
Let's try this on the terminal.
"""Here, type: sudo space userdel space -(hyphen)r space duck."""
I have used the '-(hyphen)r' option.
This is to remove the user along with his home directory.
Let us press Enter and see what happens.
Now the user duck has been deleted.
Check this by typing:
ls space /(slash) home and press  Enter.
We will find that the user account duck has been deleted.
Let me go back to the slides now.
Some of the useful commands in Linux System Administration are “df” and “du”.
The df command gives a report on the free space available on the disk.
And the du command gives a report on how much space a file has occupied.
Please try these two commands and find the output for yourself as an assignment.
Let us shift to the terminal. I shall show you a few useful options used with the “df” command.
Please type: df space -(hyphen)h and press Enter.
"""Here, it shows the size of the File system and the space used."""
"""It also shows the space mounted on, in a human readable format."""
Let us now try some options with the “du” command.
"""At this point, I assume that you have created some text files in your home folder."""
"""If not, please refer to the tutorial on General Purpose Utilities in Linux."""
I have already created some text files in my home directory to execute the commands.
Go to home folder on the terminal by typing:
cd space /(slash) home and press Enter.
"""Then, type: du space -(hyphen)s space *. (asterisk dot) txt and press Enter."""
This command will give you a report on the txt files available in the directory along with its file sizes.
"""As an assignment, at the command prompt, please type:"""
du space -(hyphen)ch space *.(asterisk dot) txt and see what happens.
Let me go back to the slides.
"""To summarize, we have learnt:"""
"""""""adduser"""" command to create a new user."""
“su” command to switch from one user to another user.
“usermod” command to change the user account settings.
“userdel” command to delete the user account.
"""""""id"""" command to know the information about user ids and group ids."""
“df” command to check the file system size and its availability.
“du” command to check the space occupied by a file.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on “Basics of system administration”.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on block diagram creation using Xfig.
"""In this tutorial, we will explain how to create block diagrams of the type given below."""
We will see the tools required for this purpose:
"""I shall use Xfig, a block diagram manipulation tool."""
"""I am using version 3.2, patch level 5."""
I will also use the terminal and a 'pdf' browser.
I am creating this tutorial on Mac OS X.
Xfig works on Linux and Windows also.
Installation on Linux is the easiest of all.
The procedure to use Xfig is the same in all three.
It is recommended to use a three button mouse for Xfig.
But one or two button mouse can also be configured to work.
The user manual for Xfig is available on the web.
Let us see it. We can see the introduction to Xfig in this page.
"""We can see the Table of Contents of this manual, here."""
Let us click on it.
"""We can see the details of the people who created Xfig, here."""
Let us see this page.
I will now explain the screen configuration for this tutorial.
"""It has the slides, Xfig, internet browser – Firefox and the terminal."""
This is the command I used to invoke Xfig on Mac.
"""These are arranged in an overlapping fashion, for easy switch from one to the other."""
The listener can easily see the switch happening – no need for guess work.
Let us start with Xfig.
The left hand side of Xfig worksheet has the drawing mode panel.
The buttons on top half of this panel can be used to create different objects.
The ones in the bottom are used to work with them.
"""Using the buttons at the top, one can carry out File and Edit operations."""
The space in the centre is known as the canvas.
This is where the figure will be created.
Let us now get started with drawing.
The first thing I will do is to put the grids on the canvas.
"""I do this by clicking on the Grid Mode button, at the bottom."""
We can choose different grid sizes. I will choose the middle one.
Grids help align the different objects that we would place.
"""In this tutorial, by clicking I mean clicking the left mouse button and releasing it."""
"""Similarly, selecting or choosing a button would mean that you have to click it with the left mouse."""
"""If a different action is required, I will state it explicitly."""
"""As our diagram should have a box, let us choose the Box symbol with sharp corners, from the left hand side panel."""
We will go to the place where we want to place the box.
We will click the mouse at this point.
This selects the north west corner of the box.
Move the mouse to the opposite end until the box is of the size we want.
"""Once the box is of right size, we can click the mouse once again."""
The box is now created.
"""We will now explain how to use the Edit feature of Xfig.  Using this, we will increase the thickness of the box."""
Let us press the Edit button in the left hand panel.
We see that all the key points of the box are displayed.
Let us click on any one of these points and thus select the box.
A dialog-box opens.
We will take the mouse to the Width box.
Make sure that the mouse pointer stays within the box.
Let us delete the default value of 1.
The contents of this box cannot be changed if the mouse is not inside the box.
"""If the mouse moves away at any time of entry in the box, please bring it inside and continue typing."""
Let us now enter 2.
We click the Done. Let me show you this.
Click the Done and leave the dialog-box.
We see that the thickness of the box has increased.
We would now want to enter lines with arrows.
Let us choose the POLYLINE button from the left hand side panel.
The panel at the bottom is known as the Attributes panel.
"""Using the buttons present in this panel, the parameters of each object may be changed."""
The number of buttons change depending on the chosen object.
Let us select the Arrow Mode button from the attributes panel.
Let us choose the second option in the dialog-box as this would give an arrow at the end point.
Let us click the Arrow Type button.
"""In the window that appears, we select the arrow head of our choice."""
Let us click at the point where we want the line to start.
Let us now click there with middle mouse button
The line is created with an arrow.
"""Remember, you have to press the middle button to complete the arrow."""
Not the left or right button.
"""If you make a mistake, please click the Edit and press Undo."""
"""Let us draw another line, at the output of the box, by copying."""
Choose the COPY button from the left hand side panel.
Choose the line.
Move the mouse to the destination and click.
The line is copied.
Let us put some text now.
"""Let us click the Text box, indicated by T, from the left hand side panel."""
Let us choose the font-size of the text.
Let us click the Text Size button from the attributes panel and obtain a dialog window.
Let us move the mouse to the value-box and keep the mouse there.
Let us delete the default value of 12 and enter 16.
Let us choose the button Set.
The dialog-box gets closed and the Text Size is now shown as 16 in the attributes panel.
We will centre align the text.
Let us click the Text Just button in the attributes panel.
Let us choose the middle one for centre alignment.
Let us click at the centre of the box.
I will type Plant and click the mouse.
The text is created.
"""I can move the text with the Move key on the left hand side panel, if required."""
Let us now save this figure.
"""Let us click the File button at the top left hand corner of Xfig, hold and drag the mouse to Save and release."""
"""As this is the first time, Xfig asks for the file name."""
We can choose the directory and then the file name.
"""Let us type the name as """"block"""" and choose Save."""
"""The file gets saved as """"block.fig""""."""
You can see that name at the top.
Let us now export the file.
"""Let us click the File button once again, hold and drag the mouse to Export."""
"""Click the box next to Language, hold and drag the mouse to PDF and release the key to select the PDF Format."""
"""Now click the Export button. We get the file """"block.pdf""""."""
Let us open this file through the command open block.pdf from the terminal.
We now have the block diagram that we wanted.
We have completed our objective. We have the figure we want.
We have an assignment for you.
Substitute the box with different objects.
Create a rectangle using Polyline. Change the size and the direction of the arrows in the figure.
"""Move the text, line and box to different locations."""
Export the file in 'eps' format and view it.
"""View the file """"block.fig"""" in an editor and identify different components."""
Create entirely different block diagrams.
We have now come to the end of this tutorial.
"""Spoken Tutorial is a part of the Talk to a Teacherproject, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT),MHRD,Government of India."""
I have downloaded a few more web pages.

Here is a sample spoken tutorial.
“ Recording File”
We now explain  the process involved in creating spoken tutorials.
We start an outline as shown here.
We  write the script for each tutorial as shown here.
Then we record the script.
We have already seen the recording. Then we translate the script as shown here.
Then we dub it as shown here.
Recording files
This was a tutorial in Hindi.
We will come back to this.
Here is the  architecture of a spoken tutorial.
"""We conduct workshops using spoken tutorials, Domain experts are not required."""
Workshops are of 2 hour duration.
The students learn at their own speed.
They can use a  language of their  choice.
All of them can reach the same level.
We have found the workshops to be very effective.
These workshops are becoming very popular.
We currently conduct 200 workshops a month.
"""Number of confirmed workshops in North, West, East and South."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Introduction to Gmail.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to create a new google account, login to gmail using the google account, write an email, send an email, view an email and logout of gmail."
We will also learn about some of the important mailboxes like Inbox.
"""For this tutorial, you will need -  a working Internet connection"" and a web browser."
"""For demonstration, I will be using Firefox web browser."""
"""Lately, Google has provided a single account for all Google products like:"""
Gmail YouTube
Google Play Google Docs/Drive
Google Calendar....  and more.
"""So, with the same login, you can operate any of these."""
Let's begin by creating a new google account.
Open your web browser and type: http colon slash slash gmail dot com (http://gmail.com).
It will take us to the page where we can see 2 options at the top right-
Create an account   and Sign in.
"""If this is the first time this page is accessed from your machine, it will look like this."""
"""If this page has already been accessed from your machine, then the page will look like this."""
"""So, you will see text-boxes to enter your email username and password."""
And a big button that says Sign In.
"""Below this, you will see a link that says Create an account."""
Let's click on the Create an account link.
We are now in the Google Account creation page.
"""We can see a form on the right, wherein we have to fill our account and personal details."""
Let's enter our first and last names in the respective text-boxes.
I will give my name as Rebecca Raymond.
"""Next, we have to choose our username."""
Username  has to be unique and can be made up of alphabets or alpha-numeric combinations.
"""Let's give the username as """"becky0808""""."""
"""If the username is already taken, we will see the following message:"""
"""“Someone already has that user name, Try another”."""
Google will also suggest some usernames based on the first and last names we have given.
We can give any username of our choice and check for availability.
"""Now, I will give the username  as ray.becky.0808."""
This goes through which indicates this username is available.
"""Now, we have to create a password for this account."""
The information box on the left tells us how long the password should be.
Type a suitable password of your choice.
Then re-type the password to confirm it.
After this comes Birthday.
Select the month from the drop-down.
Then type the day and year in the respective text boxes.
Now select your gender. I am selecting Female.
The next field is Mobile phone.
I will skip this for now.
"""After this, is a text box that asks for our current email address."""
"""If you have an alternate email address, apart from the one you are creating now, type it here."""
"""If you don't, leave it as blank."""
Let's fill the remaining details now.
The next segment “Prove you're not a robot” has 2 verification steps.
Phone verification
Puzzle verification.
We can proceed with any one of these 2 options.
I will go with the puzzle verification.
"""Type the text/number shown in the image, in the Type the text text-box."""
"""The country where you are located is displayed, by default, in the Location drop-down."""
"""I am located in India. So, India is shown in my Location drop-down."""
"""Lastly, click on I agree to the Google Terms of service and Privacy Policy check-box, to check it."""
"""Once all the details are filled in the form, we have to click on Next Step button."""
"""Right now, we will not do so."""
"""Let us see what to do, if we select “Phone Verification”."""
Click on the “Skip this verification (Phone Verification may be required)” check-box.
Choose the location as India (भारत)
Then click on I agree to the Google Terms and Privacy Policy check-box.
"""And lastly, click on Next Step."""
It will divert to the Phone verification page.
"""Select a country flag from the dropdown, I am selecting  India."""
Enter your mobile number in the text box provided.
"""Select Text message (SMS)  option. Usually, it will be selected by default."""
Then click on Continue button.
You will receive an SMS on your phone.
It will now take you to the next part of the verification.
"""Type the verification code you received from Google via SMS, in the text box provided."""
Click on Continue.
We are now in the 'Create your public Google+ profile' page.
"""Here, you can see your name."""
"""Below this, there is an option to “Add a photo”."""
You can click on this to add a photo for your Google profile.
There is also a button named “Create your profile”.
"""For the time being, I'm skipping these steps."""
"""Instead, I will click on No Thanks  button to proceed to my email account."""
"""Now, we are in the welcome page."""
"""And in my case, it says “ Welcome, Rebecca”."""
My new email address ray.becky.0808@gmail.com is also displayed.
"""Now, click on Continue to Gmail button."""
It will start loading your mail account.
Based on your internet speed this may take some time.
"""If our internet is slow, we can click on Load basic HTML."""
It is available at the right side bottom.
It will load gmail without any graphical look.
Some information boxes will  pop-up on the screen.
Read them or explore further by clicking on the Next button and then close them.
This is the default or Standard view of your gmail account.
The center display area is where we can see all our mails.
"""Notice that there are three tabs here. We will learn about them in detail, in future tutorials."""
"""On the left side, we can see some labeled menu items."""
"""Inbox, Starred, Sent Mail, Drafts, and More are some of the prominent mailboxes of Gmail."""
"""By default, Inbox is selected and its contents are shown in the display area."""
Notice that Inbox has no. 3 in brackets.
This indicates the number of new mails that you have received.
"""When we create a new google account, we get some mails from the Gmail Team."""
You can read them for more information on how to use Gmail features.
"""Now, let's learn how to write an email."""
Click on the COMPOSE button on the left-hand side.
A window with the name New Message opens up.
It has four segments.
To – is the place where we type the email address of the person to whom we want to send the email.
"""Here, I'll type the same email-id that we created just now, i.e. ray.becky.0808@gmail.com"""
It means that I'm sending a mail to myself.
Next segment is Subject.
"""Here, we can type the brief subject line about the mail."""
Let's say “Welcome mail”.
Next is the content area.
Here we have to write our message that we want to send.
"""Let's type, “Greetings to all from the Spoken Tutorial Project”."""
"""In the last segment, there is a blue button that says Send."""
Click on it to send the email.
Notice the number of mails in the Inbox is now 4.
"""To read a particular mail, simply click on it."""
Here is the mail I sent to myself.
Let's have a look at it.
Click on the Show details arrow.
Here are the email addresses of the sender and receiver.
Here is the date and time when the email was sent.
Here is the subject line of the email.
And the content is here.
"""Now, notice that the number of unread emails in the Inbox is 3."""
"""Now, let us learn how to sign out from Gmail."""
"""At the top right, you will see your email-id."""
"""If you had uploaded a photo during account creation then you will see that, here, instead."""
Here is the Sign Out button. Just click on it to sign out.
You have successfully signed out of Gmail.
This brings to the end of this tutorial.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Creating and viewing inventories.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
To modify the login page to redirect to admin page
To fetch all the book details
To fetch borrowed book details
To display the books borrowed by a logged in user.
Here we are using:
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have  knowledge of:"""
Basics of Java Servlets and JSPs
Database and validation of fields.
"""Now, let us switch to NetBeans IDE ."""
I have created the Books table.
You can see the different fields in the table.
I have inserted 10 books into this table.
I have created Checkout table to store borrowed books.
I have inserted 5 entries into the Checkout table.
I have also created a model for Book and Checkout.
Book.java is a book model.
And Checkout.java is a checkout model.
"""Now, come to the browser."""
Let us login as the admin.
"""So, I will type the username and password as admin. Then click on Sign In."""
We can see that we come to the Admin Section Page.
We will come back to this page. Now let us switch to Netbeans IDE.
"""We will see,  how we modified the GreetingServlet to redirect to Admin Page."""
Let us see the GreetingServlet.java.
Here we check if username and password equal admin.
"""If yes, then we redirect to adminsection.jsp."""
We have already seen how to forward to another page using RequestDispatcher.
"""Now, switch back to the browser."""
We have two options here.
We will click on the radio button for List Books.
Then click on Submit button.
"""Here, we can see that we have the list of all the Books."""
"""It has all the details like- Book Id, Book Name, Author Name, ISBN, Publisher, Total Copies and Available copies."""
"""Now, I will show you how this is done."""
Switch back to the IDE.
"""Now, let us come to  adminsection  dot jsp."""
Here we have two radio buttons.
The first one is to list all the books.
"""We can see that in adminsection  dot jsp, we have form action  equal to AdminSection."""
"""Now, Open AdminSection  dot  java."""
"""Here, this checks the option that we click on."""
We clicked on List Books.
"""So, this part of the query will be  executed."""
We execute the query to fetch books from Books table.
"""Next, we create ArrayList to store the details of the books."""
Then we iterate through the result set.
We create the Book object.
We set BookId into the Book object.
"""Similarly, we set other attributes of the book into the Book object."""
Then we add book object into the books list.
Then we set the ArrayList books into the request.
Then we forward the request to listBooks.jsp using RequestDispatcher.
"""Now, we come to listBooks.jsp."""
"""In this page, admin can view the list of books."""
"""Here, first we obtain the books from the request."""
This HTML table will display the details of the books.
"""So, we will iterate through the book list."""
Here we display the BookId of the book.
"""Similarly, we display other attributes of the book."""
This is how we display the list of books.
"""Now, switch back to the browser."""
Click on List Borrowed Books.
And click on the Submit button.
We see a list of all the Books issued.
"""It has details like Transaction Id, Book Id and Username."""
"""Now, I will switch back to the IDE"""
and show you the code for the same.
Go to AdminSection.java.
We had clicked on List Borrowed Books.
So menuSelection is equal to List Borrowed books.
The steps are similar to what we saw for List Books.
We execute the query to fetch borrowed books details from the Checkout table.
Then we iterate through the borrowed books
and set it into request as checkout attribute.
"""Now, we come to listBorrowedBooks.jsp."""
Here we obtain checkout from the request.
We iterate through the Checkout list
and here we display the attributes of the Checkout.
This is how we display Borrowed Books.
"""Now, switch back to the browser."""
"""In the borrowed books page, we  have one more list."""
The list of books issued when the current date is more than the return date.
Switch back to IDE to see the code.
This is done in the same way as we did for Borrowed Books.
The only difference is in the SQL query.
"""In the query, we give the condition: return_date less than now() order by transaction_Id."""
"""Now, I will show you the interface for a normal user."""
Switch back to the browser.
Come back to the login page.
I will login as mdhusein.
Type the password as welcome
and click on Sign In.
We get a Success Greeting Page.
It has the books currently borrowed by the user.
"""It has details like Transaction Id, User Name, Book Id and Return Date."""
"""Now, let us come back to the IDE."""
Now we go to GreetingServlet.java.
We display the books issued in the same way as we did for the admin.
Here the difference will be that we have to display the books for the logged in user.
"""So, I get the username from this line."""
Then we fetch the details of borrowed books
with the condition username is equal to the logged-in user.
"""So, we get the list of books issued for the corresponding user."""
"""Then, in successGreeting dot jsp we will display the list."""
This is how your successGreeting dot jsp will look.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt to:"""
Modify the login page to redirect to admin page
To fetch the book details
To fetch the borrowed book details and
To display the books borrowed by a logged in user.

Welcome to Meet the GIMP.
Today’s tutorial is not about raw converting but about new coding while doing a real show and to correct some errors from the last tutorial.
I want to tell you something about this image .
I have made some additional changes while recording the show.
"""As you can see the sea is a bit dull and it’s just gray with not much definition in it and when I switch off the Sea layer here and the other layers, you can see there is some definition in the sea."""
"""And when I look at the layer mask, you can see that I used a layer mask which is mostly gray for the area I wanted to show."""
"""So, let’s redo this step again."""
I have deleted the Sea layer and made a copy of the Background layer.
I name the layer as Sea and place that layer below the Sky and above the Land.
I could have worked with the layer I had but I wouldn’t have got a good result because I had used the curves tool to get the sea a bit darker.
"""And with that, I have destroyed a lot of colour information which was present in that layer and I’ll get a better result this way here."""
"""Now, I again add a layer mask to the Sea layer, I use the Gray scale copy of the layer and add it."""
I click on Show layer mask and edit the layer mask.
I will use the Curves tool and I’ll repeat the same procedure by pulling this down but this time I’ll pull this upper curve up.
Now I have a layer mask which is nearly white for the area of the sea and sky and nearly black for the area of land.
"""To correct some missing structure here, I select the Brush tool and choose a bigger Brush here and start painting the land area with black colour."""
"""I don’t want to paint the sea layer with black colour. So, I exchange the foreground and background colour."""
And go to the sea area and start painting with white colour and I think I should do this a bit softer.
"""This area here, I think it was quite well but you can correct that later on."""
"""So, let’s choose a soft brush and see that we get this edge here fine."""
"""When I disable Show Layer Mask, we can see the stretch scene here on the border between land and sea."""
Let’s zoom into the image and you can see there is a halo where the layer mask and the layer don’t work together and I’ll work on it later.
Now I go back to the full image with Shift + Ctrl + E.
I select the Curves tool and check if I have layer mask selected and I include the Sky layer to see the whole image and now I click into the image and play with the curves.
Now you can see the halo between the sea and the land vanishes but the sea is now again bit dull.
But I can pull the curve up here and I get a clear sea here.
And I think I shouldn’t over do it.
"""I can see the sun shine on the sea, the shadow of the clouds, different wave structures and a bit blue colour as it should be on the sea."""
There is a bit problem with the bright stuff at the edge of the sky because sky  is too brightened up and I can solve that problem in later steps.
"""Ok, I can adjust with the Opacity slider the effect of Curves tool and I think I should make it a bit less for a good effect."""
A tip from John Arnold’s broadcast says that we should go to the full possible amount and then go down with the slider because it is much easier to see the effect when you go down
and we can decide the right amount easily.
"""And I think I have done too much with this part. So, I slide the slider down and I think this is ok."""
From where does this bright stuff comes on the horizon?
I deselect the Sky layer and check but it’s not because of it.
"""So, I deselect the Sea layer and its because of Sea layer."""
And I have to darken this part here.
And for doing that I use the Gradient tool.
I select the layer mask and now select the Gradient tool from the tool box and I want to have the land part white and sky part black and I want to have the border here.
The gradient starts with full white and ends with black.
"""So, I zoom into this part. I select the Gradient tool and  start around here."""
"""While making the line, I am pressing Ctrl key and left mouse button and pulling in order to get a straight line and leave the button here."""
"""You see, it worked! The brightness on the horizon is gone and you can see that the layer mask of the land is gone too."""
Let’s have a look at the whole image and you can see all our edits are gone.
"""So, this wasn’t the good way to deal with the horizon so I undo this step here."""
"""Now, first I select the rectangle and check if layer mask is selected and draw the Rectangle in the sky part."""
Now when the rectangle is drawn I can do edit work inside it and rest of the layer mask will not be affected.
Now I again do the same procedure.
Zoom into the bright part here and select the Layer Mask.
"""I want to have black above and white below. So, I start from here, go straight up to the horizon and now you can see  the sea is only white and land and sky are black."""
"""Shift + ctrl + A, disables all selection, shift +ctrl + E goes back to the whole image and  a lot better now."""
I want to edit the Sky layer in the same way like I did for the Land layer.
Just double the Sky layer and switch to Overlay mode.
This is way too much. So I pull down the Opacity slider a bit and we have a bit more contrast in the sky.
And now I think the image is nearly ready except for one thing.
This wall of the house here is way too dark.
This is the case for dodging and burning.
"""Dodging and burning is a term out of the dark room days, where you can  dodge  a picture by keeping your hand or paper or something else in the light beam of the enlarger between the enlarger and photographi"
There you take a paper and cut a hole in a specific form into it and so edit some light to some other parts of the image.
"""It’s quite tedious procedure to figure out which step to be done at what time and you need a lot of sheets of paper for that and when you want to look at such a process, I recommend you to look a film Well P"
"""It’s a film about James and it’s a terrific film even without this, a dark chamber seen."""
I can really recommend you that film.
Now let’s see dodging and burning process.
We have a Dodge and Burn tool in the toolbox here but I would like to work again with layer.
I add one more layer and I want to fill it with white .
I go to colour channel and I keep 50% for gray and 128% in other channel.
This gray colour is 50% gray and I switch the layer mode to Overlay and you can see nothing has happened.
Now I switch the colours to black and white and select a brush.
This brush size is about right. But I decrease the Opacity to let’s say 30% or so.
Now I make sure that I have the new layer  selected and change the foreground colour to white and background colour to black and I start to paint the wall here.
And perhaps you can see it that the compression has done its work and the side of the wall is brightened up.
This process is called dodging because I am keeping the light on the photographic paper and so the wall gets brighter.
When we look at the layer here you can see that I have a whiter area here and there are some other parts of the image which could be a bit lighter.
For example the rocks near the shore.
The best way would be zooming into the image and I can see that now I have made the wall brighter and the structure is nearly gone due to the JPEG compression.
But I can repair that by switching the colour and shortcut key for that is ‘X’ key and make it a bit darker here.
I should pull the Opacity slider a bit down and this is OK.
I think the horizon is very bright. So I adjust the circle size of the brush to paint that part and use black colour to darken that part of the image.
I can work through the image with changing the colour with ‘x’ key and make it a bit darker.
I think that was too much and I am not so sure about what I am doing there.
"""So, undo the step."""
You can see the technique that I made a layer and made it medium gray & 128% for each channel and change the layer mode to Overlay.
Medium gray and Overlay mode do nothing and you can paint into the image with white or black.
"""While painting with white, you make the image a bit brighter; with black you make it darker."""
I think now this image is really finished with editing.
I wouldn’t work again on it except some of you find a mistake in the edits I have made today.
I hope I haven’t done that and name the layer as Dodge and Burn.
That was it for today.

"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
"""Welcome to a presentation that introduces the spoken tutorial technology, that has the potential to make India IT literate."""
What is a Spoken Tutorial?
"""It is a recording of a computer session,"""
explaining some software along with a running commentary.
"""The resulting movie is the spoken tutorial,"""
typically of 10 minutes duration.
Steps in creating Spoken Tutorials are:
"""Outline, Script,"""
"""Recording, Translating the script into other languages and"""
Dubbing.  Let me explain each of these steps.
We will show the outline of two software systems:
Xfig and PHP/MySQL.
I have already downloaded all the required links for this tutorial from http://spoken-tutorial.org
Let us see the outline for Xfig.
Let us see the outline for PHP.
Let us go to the next slide.
The 2nd step in creating spoken tutorials is the Script.
"""As a movie needs a good script,"""
a spoken tutorial also needs a good script.
The script of the current tutorial is here.
The guidelines to write a script are here.
A tutorial that explains the guidelines will also be available soon.
I will now create a short 'spoken tutorial' that explains how to send an email from a gmail account.
"""Let me invoke iShowU, a screen recording software."""
Observe a rectangle on the screen.
Whatever comes within this rectangle will get recorded.
I have opened Netscape.
I have placed it exactly within this rectangle.
It is pointing to gmail.
I will speak in Tamil.
Let me start recording.
"""""""Guest.spoken aaga login seygiren gmail ai thirandagi vittadu"""""""
"""""""compose button moolam aarambikap pogiren"""" [1]"""
Subject: Test
ingu varuvom.
"""""""This is a test mail""""."""
Send button moolam email ai anuppugiren
"""ippodu sign out seygiren nanri, vanakkam."""
I just ended the recording.
"""Immediately, the recording software creates a movie."""
Let me first close Netscape and iShowU.
Let me now play the recorded movie.
“Recording plays”
Let us advance it.
Let me close this.
Let us now go to the next slide.
This is what I call as the spoken tutorial.
School going children can also create spoken tutorials – it is very easy.
Let me now explain the Tools we have for recording.
"""On Linux, recordMyDesktop."""
A spoken tutorial explains how to do this.
"""On Windows, we have Camstudio."""
This spoken tutorial explains how to do this.
Both are FOSS.
A tutorial gives guidelines for narration.
Let me play that.
Let me come back to slides.
The 4th Step in creating spoken tutorials is translating the script into local languages
to make it accessible for people weak in English.
I will show translated scripts for getting started on Scilab in
"""Hindi, Marathi and Bengali."""
"""Hindi, Marathi and Bengali."""
Let us go back to the browser.
"""Using the script, we change the spoken part only."""
Video remains the same.
"""On Linux, we can use Audacity and ffmpeg."""
A spoken tutorial explains how to do this.
Let me minimize this browser.
"""Underneath this, I have another browser with several tabs."""
Let me play this: “Recording plays”
"""On Windows, we can use Movie Maker."""
A spoken tutorial explains how to do this.
Let us go to the next slide.
"""We will now see Scilab spoken tutorials in Hindi, Malayalam and Bengali."""
“Recording plays”. Let me play Malayalam..  “Recording plays”. Let me play bengali..  “Recording plays”.
"""Let us go back here, to slides."""
Let us discuss how to present complex topics through spoken tutorials.
"""After all, a spoken tutorial is only ten minutes long."""
"""By combining spoken tutorials, advanced topics can also be taught."""
"""If sufficient small steps are available,"""
Himalayas can also be climbed.
"""Let us now view the study plans for """"LaTeX"""" and """"Scilab""""."""
LaTeX study plans..
Scilab study plans..
Let us go to the next slide.
One can bridge digital divide through spoken tutorials.
"""For example, one can explain: * how to buy train tickets through irctc."""
How to locate low cost agricultural loans.
How to locate information on primary health care.
How to obtain information on first aid.
How to do web search to locate the shop that sells Tvs at the lowest price.
"""Indeed, this list is endless."""
"""As a matter of fact, this approach can be used to bridge digital divide."""
Spoken tutorials are released under creative commons license.
These are available for free download from the spoken tutorial website.
Let us discuss the honorarium available for creating a ten minute spoken tutorial-
"""Rs. 3,500 to create script and slides"""
Rs. 500 for review by novice or beginner
"""Rs. 1,000 for recording the spoken tutorial - this can be done by the beginner as well"""
"""Rs. 1,000 for translation into a local language"""
Rs. 500 for dubbing into a local language
to be paid after review and acceptance.
The above amounts are for a ten minutes spoken tutorial. Actual honorarium will be proportional to the number of minutes.
"""There is a one time bonus of Rs. 5,000 also."""
"""Our target audience is a remote child,"""
"""working alone at midnight, without anyone to help her."""
"""In other words, spoken tutorials need to be created for self learning."""
"""We actively promote Open Source Software,"""
"""conduct workshops through student clubs,  using spoken tutorials and financial support."""
We also look for Campus Ambassadors.
We have a spoken tutorial on Campus Ambassador program.
Let us play it.. “Recording plays”.
Let us show the web site of our project:http://spoken-tutorial.org/
The current tutorial is available here.

We have come to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on for loop in java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the for loop in Java."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10 JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of relational operators and if statement in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please  visit  our website which is as shown. [1]"""
Here is the syntax of the for loop.
"""It consists of initialization, loop condition and increment."""
Then it has the for block which keeps on executing till the loop condition is true.
"""Now, let us try out an example in Eclipse."""
"""So, switch to eclipse."""
We already have a class named ForLoopDemo.
Let us add the for loop inside the main method.
"""So, inside the main method , type: int i semicolon."""
"""Then, for within parentheses i  equal to 0 semicolon i  less than  10  semicolon i  equal to  i plus 1."""
This statement decides how the loop is going to progress.
i =0 is the starting condition for the loop.
This condition allows the variable to be initialized.
i<10  is the loop running condition.
If the condition is true then the for block will be executed.
"""Else, it will be ignored."""
"""That means, when 'i' becomes more than or equal to 10, the block is not executed."""
Then i= i+1 states how the loop variable is going to change.
"""Here, the value of 'i' starts with 0."""
"""It keeps increasing by 1, for every iteration of the loop, until it becomes 10."""
"""Now, let us do something with 'i'."""
So open and close curly brackets.
"""Inside the curly brackets, type: System dot out dot  println and print i into i."""
This will print the square of each number from 0 to 9.
Let us see the output.
So save and run the program.
"""As we can see, the loop run over numbers from 0 to 9."""
The square of the number has been printed in each iteration.
"""Now, let us print all the 2 digit numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5."""
"""So, i should have values from 10 to 99."""
"""So, change i equal to 0 to i equal to 10."""
And i less than 10 to i  less than 100.
"""Then, inside the curly brackets, we print the number only if it is a multiple of 3 or 5."""
So type:if within brackets i mod 3 equal equal to 0 OR within brackets i mod 5  equal equal to  0
This statement checks whether 'i' is divisible by '3'or by '5'.
"""Then, in curly  brackets, we will print the value of 'i'."""
"""Now, let us see the output."""
So save and run the program.
We can see that the numbers are either multiples of 3 or 5. In this way we use for loop in Java.
In this tutorial we have learned how to use for loop in java.
"""For assignment, a  three digit number is called Armstrong Number if it is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits."""
"""For example, 153 is equal to '1 cube' plus '5 cube' plus '3 cube'."""
Find all such 3 digit numbers.

Hello.Welcome to the tutorial on Adding a File Chooser to a Java Application.
"""Create an application, Create the application form."""
"""Add the File Chooser,"""
Configure the File Chooser and
run the application.
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System, Ubuntu version 12.04"""
and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to add a File chooser to a Java Application using the javax.swing.JFileChooser component."""
"""As a part of this exercise, we will learn to create a small Java application that loads a '.txt' file into a Text Area."""
Let us first create the Java Application:
Launch the IDE.
"""From the main menu, choose File and New Project."""
"""Choose the """"Java"""" Category and the """"Java Application"""" Projects type."""
And click Next.
"""In the Project Name field, let's type: """"JFileChooserDemo""""."""
Clear the Create Main Class check-box.
Make sure that the Set as Main Project check-box is selected.
Click Finish.
"""Here, we will create the JFrame container and add a few components to it."""
Right-click on the Source Packages node.
Choose New > Other.
Choose the Swing GUI Forms categories and the JFrameForm type.
Click Next.
"""For Class Name, type: """"JFileChooserDemo""""."""
"""In the Package field, type: """"jfilechooserdemo.resources""""."""
Click Finish.
"""In the Properties window, select the Title property"""
"""and type: """"Demo Application""""."""
Press Enter to confirm.
"""In the Palette, open the Swing Menus category."""
Select the Menu Bar component and drag it to the top left corner of the Jframe.
Right-click the Edit item of the Menu Bar component.
Select Delete in the context menu.
"""Next, let us add a menu item that allows to open the FileChooser from the running application."""
Make sure that the Menu Bar' is selected before you drag another Menu Item here.
"""In the Swing Menus category in the Palette, select a new Menu Item."""
Drag it to the Menu Bar and drop it onto the File item of the Menu Bar.
Right-click jMenuItem1 in the Design view.
And choose Change Variable Name from the context menu.
Rename the item to Open and click OK.
Make sure that the jMenuItem1 is still selected in the Design view.
Press the Space bar to edit the text of the component.
Change the text to Open and press Enter to confirm.
Specify the action handler for the Open menu item.
"""Right-click the menu item Open and choose Events, Action, Action Performed from the context menu."""
The GUI builder automatically switches to the source view.
A new event handler method  OpenActionPerformed()  is generated.
Let us switch back to the  Design  view.
Let's add a menu item to exit the  File Chooser.
"""In the  Palette , choose the Swing Menus category."""
Select  Menu Item.
Drag it to the  Menu Bar below the Open menu item on the form.
Notice the orange highlighting that indicates where the jmenuItem1  is going to be placed.
Right-click jMenuItem1  in the  Design view.
Choose Change Variable Name from the context menu.
Rename the item to Exit  and click on OK.
Make sure that the jMenuItem1  is still selected in the Design view.
Press the Space bar  to edit the text of the component.
Change the text to  Exit  and press  Enter  to confirm.
Specify the action handler for the  Exit  menu item.
Right-click the menu-item Exit.
"""Choose  Events, Action, Action Performed  from the context menu."""
The GUI Builder automatically switches to the Source view.
A new event handler method named  ExitActionPerformed() is generated.
The  ExitActionPerformed  node appears in the  Navigator  window above the   OpenActionPerformed()  node.
"""If you cannot view your  Navigator,"""
"""go to the  Window  menu in the menu bar,"""
choose  Navigating  and click on  Navigator.
"""Here, you can see the  ExitActionPerformed  node appearing above the  OpenActionPerformed  node."""
"""To make the  Exit  menu-item work,"""
let us include the statement  System.exit(0);  into the  ExitActionPerformed()  method body.
Switch back to the  Design  mode.
"""From the  Swing Controls category of the  Palette, drag a Text Area  onto the form."""
"""Resize the added component to make room for the text, displayed by the  File Chooser  later."""
"""Rename the variable as """"textarea""""."""
Let us next add the actual  File Chooser.
"""If your  Navigator  window is not open, choose  Window, Navigating, a Navigator  to open it."""
"""And in the  Navigator, right-click the Jframe node."""
"""Choose  Add From Palette, Swing Windows and File Chooser  from the context menu."""
You can notice in the  Navigator  that a  JFileChooser  was added to the form.
Right-click the  JFileChooser  node and rename the variable to  fileChooser.
We have now added the  File Chooser.
The next step is to configure the File Chooser  to display the title that you want.
We will also add a custom file filter and integrate the File Chooser into your application.
Click to select the  JfileChooser in the  Navigator window.
"""Now, let's edit its properties in the  Properties  dialog-box."""
"""In the  Properties window, below the Palette,"""
"""change the dialogTitle to """"This is my open dialog""""."""
Press Enter  to confirm.
"""Now, switch to the Source mode."""
"""Now, to integrate the  FileChooser  into your application,"""
I have an existing code snippet which I will copy and paste into the existing OpenActionPerformed() method.
This example reads the file contents and displays them in the Text Area.
We will now call the FileChooser's getSelectedFile()  method to determine which file the user has clicked.
"""I will copy this code onto my clipboard and in the Source view of the IDE, paste it inside the  OpenActionPerformed() method."""
"""If the editor reports errors in your code, right-click anywhere in the code and select Fix Imports."""
"""Now, let us add a custom file filter that makes the File Chooser display only '.txt' files."""
Switch to the Design mode and select the fileChooser in the Navigator window.
"""In the Properties window, click the ellipsis button, next to the fileFilter property."""
"""In the fileFilter dialog-box, select Custom Code from the combo-box."""
Type new MyCustomFilter() in the text field
and click OK.
"""To make the custom code work, we will write the MyCustomFilter class."""
This inner or outer class will extend the fileFilter class.
I will copy and paste this code snippet
"""into the source of our class, below the import statements."""
Right-click the JFileChooserDemo project in the Project window and select Run to start the sample project.
"""In the Run Project dialog-box, select the jfilechooserdemo.resources.JFileChooserDemo main class."""
"""In the running Demo Application, choose Open in the File menu to trigger the action."""
Open any text file to display its contents in the text area.
Let me select the Sample.txt file and choose Open.
The fileChooser displays the contents of the text file.
"""To close the application, select Exit in the File Menu."""
"""In this tutorial, you learnt to:"""
Add a File chooser to a Java application and
Configure the File chooser.
As an assignment- use the same demo project we have created and add the following features:
Add a Save menu item under the menu bar.
Add keyboard short-cuts for all the menu items.
"""Add a code snippet to the Save action, to save the file."""
I have already created a similar assignment where the file chooser displays the Save option under the File menu
and gives you the option to save the text file which you open.

About GAMESS
GAMESS stands for:  General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System. (GAMESS) It is a general ab initio quantum chemistry package.
"""It is available at no cost, to both academic and industrial users."""
Information about installation and download is given at the following link. http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/download.html
Now we have generated input files for GAMESS and Gaussian programmes.
These input files are ready to be loaded into respective programmes.
Viewers please note: Gaussian is a commercial software.  Hence I will not be able to show the interface to load the input file.
As mentioned earlier GAMESS is free software.
"""Those interested can download GAMESS software from the given link. And, load the input file to generate the output file. http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/download.htm"""
I have some Gaussian and GAMESS output files on the desktop.
I have provided these files as code files along with this tutorial.
Let's view these output files in avogadro.
Open a new Avogadro window.
Click on open icon in the tool bar.
Navigate to the file location. Select Benzene.log
"""The file opens, we can see the structure of benzene on the panel."""
Benzene.log was generated using Gaussian.
It contains information about molecular orbitals and C-C and C-H bond stretching.
Sometimes the log file may not show orbital information.
In such case open the .fchk file provided in the codefiles.
"""To view the orbitals, click on the orbital name from the list."""
"""If you want to change the display of orbitals, click on the spanner symbol next to surfaces option in the display types."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Abstract Classes.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:  Abstract Methods and Concrete Methods"""
Abstract Classes and Concrete Classes and
How to use Abstract Classes.
"""For this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 12.04 JDK 1.7 and Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
You should also have the knowledge of subclassing in Java.
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
First we will see about Abstract Method.
An Abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.
It is declared using abstract keyword.
There should not be opening and closing parenthesis for this method.
Let us understand the usage of Abstract class with a sample program.
Now we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called AbstractDemo.
"""Inside this project, we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Abstract class."""
"""Now, right-click on src folder and click New > Class."""
Type the name of the class as Person and press Enter.
Now we will add the fields to represent the name and the age of the Person. Type:  String name semicolon.
Also type:  int age semicolon.
Now click on Source and select Generate constructor using fields.
Delete the super keyword from the generated code.
The constructor can initialise the values of name and age fields.
Next we will see about concrete method.
A Concrete method is completely implemented within the curly brackets.
We will add a concrete method to this class to print the name and age.
Type the following code as displayed on the screen.
"""This method showBasicDetails() illustrated here, is an example of concrete method."""
Observe that this method is implemented completely.
Now we will add an abstract method to this class.
"""So, type: public void showDetails( ) semicolon."""
"""An error comes up, since we have not yet added the abstract  keyword."""
"""So, now add the keyword abstract."""
Now we can see another error comes up.
"""This is because, abstract methods can be added only to abstract classes."""
"""So, now add the keyword abstract to the Person class to make it an abstract class."""
The class Person illustrated here is an abstract class.
It contains an abstract method called showDetails().
The figure here represents an inheritance relation.
"""Here, the Person class is an abstract class."""
The Employee class and the Student class are subclasses of the Person class.
These subclasses can provide their own different implementations.
These are done by showDetails( ) method present in the Person class.
"""For example: ShowDetails() Method in the Employee class prints the Employee ID and the Salary, where as ShowDetails() Method in the Student class prints the Student Register Number and Grade."""
Then right-click on the default package and create another class called Employee.
"""Now to make this a subclass of Person class, type:  extends Person."""
"""Now, we can see an error comes up in the Eclipse IDE."""
It indicates that we should provide an implementation to the abstract method showDetails( ).
We will do it a little later.
Now create two fields to represent the employee id and employee salary.
"""So, type:  String empid semicolon and int salary semicolon."""
Now click on Source and then select Generate constructor using fields.
"""This constructor can initialize the values of name, age, empid and salary."""
"""Let us now define the showDetails method. So, type: public void showDetails( )."""
"""Inside this method, we need to print the employee details."""
Type the following code as displayed on the screen.
"""Note that the error disappears, once the showDetails() method is implemented."""
Next we will see a Student class of the project.
I have already created a subclass called Student.
There are two fields in the Student class – register number and grade which represent student register number and grade.
A constructor is also created inside this class.
"""This constructor can be used to initialize the values for name, age, register number and grade."""
The showDetails method is also implemented in this class.
It prints the values of Student Register Number and grade.
Now note that the Employee class has its own implementation of showDetails().
And the Student class has its own implementation of showDetails().
Now right-click on the default package.
Click on New > Class and then type name as Demo.
"""Inside this class, we will have the main method."""
"""So, type main and then press ctrl+space to generate the main method."""
Now let us try to instantiate the Person class by typing Person p equals new Person.
Within brackets and double quotes type John and put a semicolon.
Now we can see an error. This is because the Person class is abstract and it cannot be instantiated.
Let's remove this line.
Type the following code as displayed on the screen.
"""Now, let us instantiate the Person class using the Employee class as Person p1 equals new Employee."""
"""In the first line, we are passing the values of different arguments."""
John is passed as Employee name.
40 as the value of age.
E267 as the value of Employee ID and 10000 as the value of Employee salary.
Now we can invoke the concrete method in the Person class as p1.showBasicDetails().
We can also call the showDetails() method using the object p1 as p1.showDetails().
Similarly instantiate the Person class using the Student class.
This is represented as Person p2 equals new Student.
Now we are passing the values of different arguments.
We can invoke the showBasicDetails() method and showDetails() method using the object as shown.
Now let us run this Demo program.
"""So, right-click on the class Demo and then select Run as > Java Application."""
We can see the output with the basic employee details like name and age.
These are printed by showBasicDetails() method.
Other employee details like employee ID and salary are printed by the showDetails() method.
Similarly the basic student details like name and age are printed by showBasicDetails() method.
Other details of the student like Student register number and grade are printed by the showDetails() method.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about: Abstract Methods and Concrete Methods"""
Abstract Classes and Concrete Classes and  How to create and use Abstract Classes.
"""As an assignment,  create an abstract class Vehicle which contains an abstract method run()."""
Create asubclass Car which extends the Vehicle class and implements the run method that prints “Car is running on 4 wheels”.
Also create asubclass Bike which again extends the Vehicle class and implements the run method that prints “Bike is running on 2 wheels”.
Also create a Demo class containing the main method to verify the results.

"""Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on taking User input in Java, using BufferedReader ."""
To take user input in Java
About InputStreamReader and BufferedReader.
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
"""how to write, compile and run a simple java program in Eclipse."""
You must also know  about the data types in Java.
"""If not, please refer to the spoken tutorial on these topics available at spoken hyphen tutorial dot org."""
"""Here, I am using: Ubuntu v 11.10 JDK 1.6 and Eclipse IDE 3.7.0"""
"""Now, we will learn what a BufferedReader is!"""
It is a class in java which is used to read text from an input stream.
It provides efficient way to read array of characters and lines.
"""To make use of BufferedReader , we need to import three classes from the java dot io package."""
These three classes are: IOException InputStreamReader and BufferedReader
We will learn about packages and how to import classes in the coming tutorials.
Now how is the input taken?
All the input that we take from the user will be in the form of string.
It has to be then typecasted or converted to the particular data type.
We will see that while we write our program to take the user input.
"""Now, let us see the syntax to implement BufferedReader."""
"""Once you import the three classes, you need to create an object of InputStreamReader."""
You also need to create an object of  BufferedReader.
We will learn about this in detail when we write our program.
"""So, let us switch to Eclipse."""
I have already opened a class named InputBufferedReader.
We will begin with importing the java.io package.
"""So, type: before the class, import space java dot io  dot star semicolon."""
"""This will import the classes InputStreamReader, BufferedReader and IOException."""
"""Now,  we will make use of BufferedReader inside the main method."""
We need to throw an IOException in whatever method we use the BufferedReader.
"""So, right after the main method type: throws space IOException."""
"""Now, what does this mean?"""
Exceptions are errors which occur in Java when some unexpected circumstances occur.
To prevent Exception errors we make use of throws keyword.
Throws is a keyword which is used during Exception handling.
It is used whenever we know that Exception error will definitely occur.
"""When we use BufferedReader, exception error always takes place."""
To prevent Exception errors from taking place we make use of throws IOException.
We will learn about Exception Handling in the coming tutorials.
"""Now, we will create an object of InputStreamReader."""
"""For that, inside the main method type: InputStreamReader space isr equalto new space InputStreamReader parentheses."""
"""Within   parentheses, type: System dot in and then semicolon."""
InputStreamReader is a class in java which allows us to take the user  input .
"""System dot in tells the java compiler to take the input from the user, using keyboard."""
The input that System  dot in takes is stored in the object of InputStreamReader for sometime.
After this we create an object of BufferedReader.
"""So, type: BufferedReader space br equal to new space BufferedReader and then parentheses."""
"""Inside the parentheses, type the object of InputStreamReader which is isr."""
"""Now, isr only helps to take the input from the user."""
BufferedReader helps to store the value in the BufferedReader object.
Isr passes this value to the BufferedReader object to store it.
"""Now, let us start taking input from the user."""
We will first ask the user to enter a String. So create a variable of String type.
Type: String space str semicolon.
Now ask the user to enter his name.
"""So, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes Enter your name and then semicolon."""
To take the input as  String we will type:
str equal to br dot readLine parentheses and then semicolon.
The readLine method will read the input from the user.
"""Now, let us take the input as an integer. Create a variable of type int."""
"""So, type:  int n  semicolon."""
Ask the user to enter his age.
"""So, type: System dot out dotprintln within brackets and double quotes  Enter your age semicolon."""
"""Also, create another variable named str1 of String type in order to take the input."""
"""Now, to take the input as String, type: str1 equal to br dot readLine parentheses  and then semicolon."""
"""To convert it into integer datatype, type: n equal to Integer with capital I  dot parseInt, capital I within brackets str1 semicolon."""
Integer is a class and parseInt is its method.
This method converts the argument passed within the bracket into integer.
"""Now, let us display the output for  name and age."""
"""So, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The name is plus str semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: System dot out dot println The age is plus n and then semicolon."""
"""Now,  Save the file, press Ctrl, S keys. Now let us run the program."""
"""So, press Control and F11 keys."""
"""In the output, you are asked to enter your name."""
"""So, type your name. I will type here Ramu,  press Enter."""
You will be asked to enter your age.
I will type here 20 and then press Enter.
We get the output as :
The name is  Ramu  And  The age is 20.
"""Thus, we know how to take an input from the user."""
In this tutorial we have learnt :
About InputStreamReader
About BufferedReader And Converting from String to the desired data type.
"""For self-assessment, take a float, byte and character input from the user and  then display the output."""
Also take a number as input and divide it by 3. Then display the output on the console.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on working with regular files in Linux.
Files and directories together form the Linux File System.
"""In a previous tutorial, we have already seen how to work with directories. You can find the tutorial at this website."""
"""In this tutorial, we will see how to handle regular files."""
"""We have already seen in another tutorial how we can create a file using the cat command. For details, please visit this website."""
"""Let us see how to copy a file from one place to another. For this, we have the cp command."""
Let us see how the command is used.
"""To copy a single file, we type: cp space one or more of the [OPTIONs]... space the name of the  SOURCE file space the name of the destination file."""
"""To copy multiple files at the same time,  we write: cp space one or more of the [OPTIONs]...the name of the SOURCE files that we want to copy and the name of the destination DIRECTORY in which these files wo"
Let us now see an Example. First we open a terminal.
"""We already have a file named """"test1"""" in our home directory."""
"""To see what is in test1, we type  $ cat space test1 and press Enter."""
"""As we can see the content of test1 is shown. Now if we want to copy it into another file called test2, we would write: $ cp space test1 space test2 and press Enter."""
Now the file has been copied.
"""If 'test2' doesn't exist, it would be first created and then the content of 'test1' will be copied to it."""
"""If it already existed then it would be silently overwritten. To see the copied file, type:  cat test2 and press Enter."""
"""We can also copy files from and to different directories. For example- type:  cp space /home/anirban/arc/demo1  which is the name of the file that we want to copy, space  /home/anirban/demo2 and press Enter."
What this will do is that it will copy the file 'demo1' from source diretory- /home/anirban/arc/ to the destination directory- /home/anirban; it will copy to a file whose name is demo2.
"""To see that the 'demo2' is there, type: ls space /home/anirban and press Enter."""
"""And as you can see, here is demo2."""
"""Before moving ahead, let us clear the screen."""
"""If you want the file to have the same name in the destination directory, you may not even mention the file name. For example-"""
Type: cp space /home/anirban/arc/demo1 space /home/anirban/ and press Enter.
This will again copy the file 'demo1' presenting the /home/anirban/arc/ directory to /home/anirban directory to a file whose name will be 'demo1' as well.
"""As before, to see the demo1, type: ls/home/anirban and press Enter."""
"""And, as you can see the demo1 file is there."""
"""Again, before moving ahead, let us clear the screen."""
Another instance when we do not need to give the destination file name is when we want to copy multiple files.
"""We assume that we have three files named test1, test2, test3 in our home directory."""
"""Now, we type:  cp space test1 space test2 space test3 space /home/anirban/testdir and press Enter."""
"""This will copy all the three files named test1,test2 and test3 to the directory  /home/anirban/testdir without changing their names."""
"""To see that these files have actually been copied, we will type: ls space /home/anirban/testdir and press Enter."""
"""As you can see test1,test2 and test3 are present in this directory."""
"""There are many options that go with cp. Here, we will see only the most important of them."""
Let us first go back to the slides.
"""Among the options, -R (The capital R) is an important one. It causes recursive copying of an entire directory structure."""
Let us see an example.
Let us try to copy all the contents of the 'testdir' directory to a directory called 'test'.
"""For that, we would type: cp space testdir slash test and press Enter."""
"""As you can see from the output message,"""
normally we cannot copy a directory having  some contents directly with the 'cp command.
But using the -R (mius R ) option we can do this.
Now we type:  cp space -R(minus capital R) space testdir/ test and press Enter.
"""The files have now been copied. To see that the test directory actually exists, type: ls and press Enter."""
"""As you can see, the 'test' directory exists. Let us clear the screen."""
"""To see the contents inside 'test', type: ls test and press Enter."""
You can see the contents of the 'test' directory.
"""Now, we go back to the slides."""
"""We have seen if a file is copied to another file that already exists, the existing file is overwritten."""
"""Now, what if we inadvertently overwrite an important file?"""
"""To prevent anything like this to occur, we have the '-b' option."""
This makes a backup of each existing destination file.
We can also use the -i(interactive)option. This always warns us before overwriting any destination file.
"""Now, let us see how the mv command works."""
This is used for moving files. Now how is that useful?
It has two major uses.
It is used for renaming a file or directory.
It also moves a group of files to a different directory.
"""mv is very similar to cp which we have already seen. So, let us quickly see how mv can be used."""
We open the terminal and type: mv space test1 space test2 and press Enter.
This will rename the file named test1 which was already present in the home directory to a file named test2.
If test2 already existed then it would be overwritten silently.
"""If we want our warning before the file is overwritten,"""
we can use the  -i  option with the mv command.
Say we have another file named 'anirban'. This file we also want to renew as 'test2'.
We will type:  mv space  -i space anirban space test2 and press Enter.
"""As you can see, a warning is provided asking whether test2 should be overwritten or not."""
"""If we press 'y' and then press Enter, the file would be actually overwritten."""
"""Like cp, we can use mv with multiple files but in that case the destination should be a directory."""
"""Before moving ahead, let us clear the screen."""
"""Suppose we have 3 files named  abc.txt, pop.txt and push.txt in our home directory."""
"""To see their presence, type  ls and press Enter."""
"""Here are the files  pop.txt, push.txt and abc.txt. Let us clear the screen."""
Now we want to move these three files to a directory called testdir.
"""What we need to do is, type:  mv space abc.txt pop.txt push.txt and then the name of the destination folder which is testdir and press Enter."""
"""To see them, type:  ls testdir  and press Enter."""
"""You can see the files  abc, pop and push.txt."""
"""Now, let us see some options that go with mv'. Let us first go back to the slides."""
The  '-b' or '–backup' option is present with the mv command. It will backup every file in the destination before it is overwritten.
"""The '-i' (minus i) option that we have already seen, warns us before overwriting any destination file."""
The next command we will see is the rm command. This command is used for deleting files.
Go back to the terminal and type: ls testdir.
We can see a file name 'faq.txt' present. Say we want to delete it.
"""For this, we type:  rm space testdir/faq.txt and press Enter."""
This command will remove the file 'faq.txt' from the /testdir directory.
"""To see that the file has been actually removed or not, let us again press  ls space testdir and press Enter."""
We can no longer see the file 'faq.txt'.
We can use the rm command with multiple files as well.
The  testdir directory contains two files 'abc2' and 'abc1.'
"""Suppose, we want to remove these files- 'abc1' and 'abc2.'"""
"""For this, we would type:  rm space testdir/abc1 space testdir/abc2 and press Enter."""
This removes the files 'abc1' and 'abc2' from testdir directory.
"""To see that they have been removed, type: ls space testdir again. You can no longer see abc1' and abc2."""
Let us clear the screen before moving ahead.
"""Now, let us go back to the slides."""
Let us summarize what we just said.
"""That is, to delete a single file we write rm and then the name of the file."""
"""To delete multiple files, we write rm and the name of the multiple files that we want to delete."""
"""Now, let us look into some of the options of the rm command."""
"""Sometimes a file is write protected. Using rm will not delete the file then. In this case, we have the -f option which can be used to force delete a file."""
The other common option is the -r option. Let us see where these option are  useful?
Let us switch back to the terminal.
"""rm command is not normally used for deleting directories. For that, we have the rmdir command."""
But rmdir command normally deletes a directory only when it is empty.
What if we want to delete a directory that has a number of files and sub-directories inside?
Let us try the rm command to do this.
Let us type rm and the directory that we want to delete which is testdir and press Enter.
"""From the output message, we can see that we can not use the rm directory to delete 'testdir'."""
But if we combine the '-r' and '-f' options then we can do this.
Press  rm -rf testdir and then press Enter.
"""Now, the testdir directory has been successfully deleted."""
Let us now go back to the slides to study the next command-
the cmp command.
Sometimes we need to check whether two files are same. If they are same then we may delete one of them.
Also we may want to see whether a file has changed since the last version.
"""For these and many other purposes, we can use the cmp command."""
It compares two files byte by byte.
"""To compare 'file1' and 'file2', we would write cmp space file1 space file2."""
If the two files have exactly the same contents then no message would be shown.
Only the prompt will be printed.
If there are differences in their contents then the location of the first mismatch will be printed on the terminal.
Let us see how cmp works. We have two files named sample1 and sample2 in our home directory.
Let us see what they contain?
"""Type: cat sample1 and press Enter. It contains the text- """"This is a Linux file to test the cmp command""""."""
The other file sample2 will contain the text and to see that we will type: cat sample2 and press Enter.
"""It will contain the text- """"This is a Unix file to test the cmp command""""."""
Now we would apply the cmp command on these two files.
We will write: cmp space sample1 space sample2 and press Enter.
"""As we can see, the first difference between the two files sample1 and sample2 is pointed out."""
Let us clear the screen before moving ahead to the next command.
The next command we will see is the wc command.
"""This command is used to count the number of characters, words and lines in a file."""
"""We have a file named """"sample3"""" in our home directory."""
"""Let us see its contents. For that, we will type: cat space sample3 and press Enter."""
This is the content of sample3.
"""Now, let us use the wc command on this file."""
"""For that, we would write wc space sample3 and press Enter."""
"""This command points out that the file has 6 lines, 67 words and 385 characters."""
These were some of the commands that help us to work with files.
There are many more commands. Moreover each of the command that we saw has many other options.
I encourage you to see more about them using the man command.
This brings me to the end of this tutorial at last.

"Srimad Bhagvad Gita, emerged off of Divine SriKrishna's lotus-face, is an entire self- existential essence of Indian culture."
'Gita to be read' is a wish of every person.
Bhagvat Gita is spoken by Krishna using Sanskrit language.
Lack of knowledge of Sanskrit is a problem for understanding of the Gita.
"Hence, being able to use the Gita as a medium of practice of Sanskrit language is a thought of Sanskrit Bharati; and its first part is this Gita-Sopaan."
This is that Gita-Sopaan's first part.
"On the basis of the Gita, these lessons are constructed for the step-wise increase of your knowledge of Sanskrit language and skill development."
"Here, for the presentation and practice of each topic, only the sentences related to Gita and Mahabharat are mostly accepted."
"In lesson titles too, as far as possible, along with the topic of that particular chapter, only the appropriate sentences from Gita are used."
"At the start of each lesson, kindly read the instructions carefully."
"Then, kindly follow your teacher's guidelines."
It is immensely beneficial to read aloud from day one.
"Hence, wherever 'read aloud' is suggested, kindly make sure to read aloud."
"Wherever there is an instruction to 'speak the sentences', kindly vocalize those sentences without hesitation."
"If you don't have much practice in Devanagari script, in that case, you will be able to practice with other books published by Sanskrit Bharati."
"For that purpose, kindly ask your Centre Teacher or Coordinator for information on many other books."
"In case there is any doubt regarding the lesson, feel free to ask your teacher for guidance."
Each day assign some time for Sanskrit practice and follow through.
This way your study will be organized.
May your Sanskrit study be successful.
It is an expectation that the Gita teacher would bring social welfare.

The Indian science of evocation of Shlokas and Mantras is unprecedented in the World.
In no other country such a science of memorization exists.
"Hence, this is India's exceptionally rare gift to the World."
This very method of memorization is intelligently used to memorize Vedas too.
"With this method, within a year, Bhagvad Gita can be effortlessly  memorized by everyone across all ages."
That exercise happens in three steps.
"1) The teacher recites one Paadam (term or concept) at a time, then the student recites the same term twice and so four terms are recited and imprinted in mind."
Then the teacher recites second line of the same Shloka.
The student repeats the line and this way the second line is practiced.
"After that, the teacher recites the entire Shloka and the student repeats it twice."
"This way repetition of ten Shlokas, recited by the teacher, happens; two more Paadam (one line) of eleventh Shloka are recited and repeated."
"2) After that, the student independently repeats those ten Shlokas ten times continuously at an appropriate time at home, everyday for the next ten days."
"At the same time, after the ten Shlokas, he repeats one line of the eleventh Shloka too."
"While repeating the previous ten Shlokas, he must start from the first line of the eleventh Shloka."
"With this two time narration, before and after, a co-relation between the group of ten Shlokas is established."
"Those Shlokas, by way of repeating ten times for ten days, get repeated a hundred times and are always at the tip of the tongue."
3) तदनन्तरं सप्ताहे वा पक्षे वा तावत्पर्यन्तं पठितानां सर्वेषां श्लोकानाम् एकवारं मुखेन कथनं भवेत् ।

The Indian music system is very closely related to nature.
 The standard notes of Indian classical music are set according to the sounds produced by animals and birds in a certain conditions and environments.
In this lesson we will learn about ragas.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able"
differentiate between swaras and ragas
idenitify Janaka Ragas and Janya Ragas
"and demonstrate two Ragas-Mãyamãlava Gowla,DheeraShankarabharana."
We learn about Raga which is the core of Indian music.
A raga is a series of notes systematically arranged 
which can bring out different experiences in a musician or a listener.
The  whole structure of Indian music is built around the concept of raga.
First we will discuss about swaras.
Every raga has a route which is arranged by
an Aarohanam (swaras arranged in ascending scale) 
an Avarohanam (swaras arranged in descending scale).
The number of ragas include 72 Melakartha ragas
but many ragas are derived from these 72 Melakartha ragas 
The ragas that are derived from any of the Melakartha raga is called Janya raga 
The parent raga is called Janaka raga.
Melakartha ragas are the parent ragas.
A  Melakartha  raga  is  one  which  has  all  7  swaras  and  has Aarohanam and Avarohanam in the correct sequential order 
"(eg.Maya malava gawla, Kalyaani, Sankarabhavanam etc.)."
"For a Janya raga, it is not necessary that it should contain all 7 swaras "
and may have its Arohanam / Avarohanam in the sequential order
"(eg. Mohana, Hamsadhwani, Sree ragam etc.)."
With  regard  to  the  7  swaras  as  mentioned  above
please  also understand that these 7 swaras are extended to make 12 more swaras and named 'Dwadasa swaras'
"with two different versions (minor & major) of swaras ri, ga, ma, dha and ni with just one sa and pa (as these two are basic swaras)."
List  of  Dwadasa  swaras  are  as  given  below.
These  used  in different variations of combinations make up the 72 Melakartha ragas
You can relate this easily if you look at the keys of an octave in a piano / harmonium.
" It's a fact, these 12 swaras together make an octave in all types of music everywhere."
"We will now learn about Raga, which is the core of Indian music."
A raga is a series of notes systematically arranged  which can bring out different experiences in a musician or a listener.
 The whole structure of Indian music is built around the concept of raga.
 Even folk melody songs are set in some raga or other.
 Some folk melodies are in mixed ragas
ie. one part of the stanza being in one raga and another stanza in another raga.
However  a combination of swaras which are pleasant to listen are known as ragas.
The Ragas are of two types especially in Carnatic music.
Janaka raga and Janya raga.
 This division of ragas into Janaka and Janya was given by Vidyaranya.
"A Janaka raga is also known as a Mela Raga, a Melakarta Raga,a Raganga Raga and a Sampoorna Raga."
There are totally 72 Janaka Ragas
Features of a Janaka raga
A Janaka raga has all the seven swaras in order in both the aarohana and the avarohana.
Example - Mayamalavagawla
It has only one variant of each swara.
The  variants  present  in  the  aarohana  are  present  in  the avarohana too.
Ragas derived from Janaka ragas are Janya ragas.
Features of a Janya raga
A Janya raga usually does not have all the seven swaras. It has either five or six swaras in the ascending scale/descending scale/both.
"Even if a Janya raga has all the seven swaras, the swaras are not in original order and/or the sequence of Swara will be different from the original."
Janya ragas are classified into the following groups
Upanga raga: A raga which has five or six notes in its ascending and/or descending scale(s) taken from its parent raga.
"Ex: Hamsadhwani (Derived from Dheerashankarabharana,the 29th Melakarta)."
Bhashanga  raga: A  raga  which  has  five  or  six  notes  in  its ascending and/or descending scale(s) taken from its parent raga 
"and one, two or three swaras not present in its parent raga."
"Ex: Bilahari (Derived from Dheerashankarabharana,the 29th Melakarta.Its Avarohana has the N3, but N2 is used in the raga too)."
"Upanga Vakra raga: The same as Upanga raga, but with the swaras not in order."
"Ex: Vasanta (Derived from Suryakanta, the 17th Melakarta)."
"Bhashanga Vakra raga: The same as Bhashanga raga, but with the swaras not in order."
"Ex: Ananda Bhairavi (Derived from Natabhairavi, the 20th Melakarta."
All Ragas are made up of the following components
Arohana  - A  set  of  notes  (scale)  used  to  play ascending melodies.
Avarohana - A scale used to play descending melodies.
"Vadi - This is the most important note in a raga (the tonic, in Western terminology)."
Samavadi - The second most important note (the dominant).
"Komal means soft and swar means ""note"""
"Any  of  what  western  theory  would  call  ""flattened""  notes included in the raga."
"Teevra Swar - Any ""sharpened"" notes included in the raga."
Varjita Swar - Any notes that should not be used when playing or composing using a particular raga.
Samaya - The  time of day when the raga would be played/sung.
Taal - A rhythm or beat associated with the particular raga.
To learn all these practically you need to go to a guru/teacher who is well-versed and also practice it daily.
Let us learn the basic components of the following Ragas
A raga is a series of notes systematically arranged which can bring out different experiences in a musician or a listener.

"The  forest  is  a  natural  environment  which accommodates besides trees, a large number of other creatures also."
 You may see huge trees aged 100 years sometimes.
" They grow very tall in  some  forests,  while  in  some  other  cases,  the  trees  spread wide."
" The varieties and types of trees grown in different forests depend upon the nature of land, rain and other environmental conditions."
Have  you  ever  thought  who  waters  the  trees  and  plants  in the  deep  forests? 
"  Definitely  no governments,  NGOs,  private organizations  etc  water  them."
 They  grow  naturally  with  rain-water.
"Different  types  of  plants  and  trees  have  been  described  and classified in Ayurveda, health science and many texts."
Manu Smriti classifies the plants as
"Vrikshayurveda, medical book for plants, has different taxonomy to offer."
 What kind of treatment should be offered for plants have been discussed in detail in Vrikshayurved.
" It's not just enough to keep human beings alone, but animals, birds, plants or any other creatures  also should  be  looked  after."
  This  was  basic understanding of Bharateeyas.
" However, Indians have thought very deeply about the nature, forest, resources etc. to understand and support as much as possible."
In a Sanskrit Subhashita the importance of trees and plants is emphasized through this shloka
According to this shloka - There is no sound which cannot be turned into a Mantra and no plant without medicinal value.
" No man on the earth is useless, but each is rare and wise, capable of discovering and rightly 'employing' all things in the environment in the right manner."
Memorise this shloka and try to understand the importance of each plant.
Indian tradition considers trees to be gods.
 We worship trees like gods.
 Five trees listed below are very popular for their divine properties and their association with the Gods
These trees are not just considered divine but have great medicinal value  also.
 The  trees  mentioned  in  the  table  are  worshiped annually or on specific days or on some festival.
Every plant has medicinal value.
 If we are informed about the medicinal properties of the plants we can use them when needed.

Many medicinal plants  can be grown around the houses for their medicinal value.
" It is very important to remember that to use any plant or tree as a medicine, you also need to consult a doctor before doing so."
Let us study about some of them.
"There are four types of tulsi mentioned in ayurvedic texts i.e. Rama, Krishna, Vana and Kapoor Tulsi."
Tulsi (the queen of herbs) has been known for its remarkable healing properties.
Tulsi is taken as the herbal tea.
"Juice of its leaves gives relief in cold, fever, bronchitis and cough."
"Many people wears the Tulsi beads, which is said to have certain physical and medicinal properties."
Brahmi  plants  act  on  the  connective  tissue development  and stimulates the healing processes.

"When we consider the cows to be very important part of farmer's life, we have to know how to look after them by feeding, cleaning, keeping them healthy, treating illness etc."
Keeping the cowshed (Goshala) clean and tidy helps a lot.
"A clean cowshed, keeps diseases away."
It make them healthy and it resulted in increased amount of healthy milk.
"So in this lesson, lets study about some simple ways to make Goshala clean."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
explain the importance of cleaning Goshalas
describe the maintenance of Goshala
explain the steps taken for cleaning process.
Goshalas are an important part of every households in rural India.
Our ancient texts are filled with praising Cows and their blessings on our life.
While emphasizing the importance of cow Rishis have said
"Let cows be before, behind and around me."
Let cows be in my heart.
Let me live in the midst of cows and  let them bless me.
"Often in India, the farmer's house is built with Soils bricks."
The entire  house  used  to  be  floored  with  Gomaya  (cow dung).
"However, this tradition is decreasing in many areas with the use of new building materials."
"It is said that cowdung has the ability to disinfect the space of its application from all kinds of harmful insects, germs, bacteria etc."
But it doesn't mean that we should not clean our Goshalas.
"Dirt, wastage such as remaining eatable of cows, cow dung, the grass and other things  layered on the floor make goshala dirty."
It reduces  the  hygiene  which  make  them  vulnerable  for  many diseases.
Keeping Goshalas clean is very important as it improves the health of cows.
Healthy cows may produce more milk with better quality.
Goshala (cowshed) is a place for the cows to relax and sleep during the night.
We all may have seen the goshala in our home or at our nearby places.
"Each cow has their own place in the resting area, called STHANA."
The Goshala may look different in different geographical areas because it is mostly prepared using local products available in the vicinity.
At some places the stone pillar are used for walls and grass is used for roof.
At some places we may see bricked walls with cement or tin sheet.
We should consider following important points while making a goshala
A  cow  needs  space  to  lie  down.
One  should  construct Gosthanas  enough  to  be  occupied  by  cows  most  of  the time.
Use appropriate products for making goshala walls.
"Stone Pillars, Brick Pillars, Wood Pillars, Unbaked brick walls, Baked brick walls or concrete walls may be used for wall making."
Good  air  flow  and  proper  lighting  must  be  managed  at Goshalas.
"If you are making bricks walls, create some holes on the walls for smooth flow of air."
"The Goshala must be covered with a roof made of iron sheets, grass thatch or concrete roof."
The roof must be high enough so that it cannot be eaten by a cow if it is made of grass or if hay is stored under it.
The shed should be constructed in such a way that the cow remains can be cleaned all the time.
Clean the cow shed every day.
"Very smooth floor may not be helpful for cows to stand, it may be very slippery"
so rough floor is ideal.
Dry leaves have to be spread on the rough floor for the cows to rest.
Clean and disinfect the floor every day.
This stops foot rot and abscesses.

Many of us are aware with the importance of cleaning goshalas.
"However, we don't know the exact and effective procedure to clean our goshalas."
Let us know the various steps used for making goshala clean and hygienic.
There should be adequate flow of air and light in the goshla.
It helps to keep it dry even in rainy seasons.
Dry materials are used to spread over the floor.
Collect the dry  materials  from  the  entire  floor  and  store  it  outside  the goshala.
"If  necessary,  use  minimal  water  to  wash  the  area  with broom or with pipe connection if bricks have been used for flooring."
The dry leaves spread on the ground should be removed along with cowdung to make organic manure.
Leave  the  cows  outside  for  grazing  for  sometimes.
"In earlier times, the cows were allowed to go into the forest for grazing."
"Once you remove the dry leaves or grass from the ground, easily the entire area becomes clean."
"The area in which the grass and cow eatables are placed, clean the area."
"In many areas, water is mixed with dry fodder alongwith wheat or oats flour."
In such cases remove the liquid remains everyday.
The waste material of the goshala should be collected at a separate place away from the goshala.
The cow dung should also be collected separately which can be used for Biogas.
"Mosquitoes, housefly and other insects are found in goshalas."
They make cows uncomfortable.
"Therefore, some fume by burning cow dung alongwith neem leaves may be used to keep them away from goshala."
These simple steps may be used for making goshala clean.
Keeping goshala clean and hygenic is very important.
Cows are an essential part of Indian society.
Goshalas are prepared mostly using locally available raw material.
It must have proper arrangements of air and light.
It should be clean every day.
Waste material should be kept seperately.

In ancient times humans used to live along river banks.
"They live in rural areas, economy was agrarian and basic needs could be fulfilled directly from natural resources."
Most of the human activities were in harmony with nature and did not affect natural environment adversely.
"With passage of time, humans enhanced their knowledge and resultant in technological advancements"
"hence growing industrialization, population explosion and desire to live a comfortable life have degraded our natural environment because we are used to living in our environment."
Any change in the environment around us which is not favourable troubles us.
"There are some changes that are not suitable to life, and they pollute our environment."
Protection of environment is very essential.
"We should protect our air, water, soil and forests in order to conserve environment."
We also have to see that the balance between natural things and living beings is maintained.
We will discuss ancient traaditonal practices which was used in India  as remedy for pollution and waste.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
explain the types and causes of pollution
identify the traditional techniques for purifying environment
traditional practices to use waste material in domestic needs.
"Vedic scriptures also mentioned the occurrence of environmental pollution  including  air,  water  and  soil  pollution  because  of artificial equipments, machines and toxic unnatural substances (synthesized chemical)."
So human life involves a number of daily activities.
Bathing  and  washing  of  clothes  with  soaps  and detergents add some chemical residue to water and change its quality.
Cooking of food by using firewood may give out smoke in  the  air.
Agricultural  activities  may  dump  fertilizers  and pesticides in the environment in modern world.
The presence of unwanted substances in a concentration which can have an adverse effect on organisms and environment is called pollution.
"Depending upon the area or the part of environment affected, pollution may be of the five types"
We all feel and breathe air.
"Sometimes, we feel very happy and remark about the fresh air around us."
The pollution in air may not be noticed until we see dust or smoke coming out from some source or some foul smell present all around.
All human activities from cooking at home to the working of highly  mechanized  industries  contribute  to  air  pollution.
"pollution  is  the  introduction  of  harmful  chemicals,  biological wastes,  and  particulate  matter  into  the  atmosphere."
Pollution has  harmful  effects  on  humans  as  well  as  on  all  other  living beings
"Pollutant gases cause irritation in eyes, throat and lungs."
"Liver, kidney, spleen and nervous system too are affected."
Also causes gastroenteritis.
Heart  related  diseases  tend  to  increase.  Many people tend to develop terminal ailments such as cancer.
"Water  pollution  is  the  contamination  of  water  bodies  like lakes,  rivers,  ground  water  and  oceans."
It  occurs  due  to  the discharge of untreated pollutants into water bodies.
It not only affects plants and organisms living near the location of discharge but  also  travels  to  other  locations  through  transportation  of polluted water.
Various sources of water pollution are
Soil pollution is caused by the addition of chemicals or other unwanted substances in the natural soil environment.
"As you can see in the pictures, soil pollution results in land degradation."
Don't you think here again we humans are responsible for the increase in soil pollution.
Addition  of  substances  that  change  the  quality  of  soil  by making  it  less  fertile  and  unable  to  support  life  is  called soil pollution
"Domestic sources: plastic bags, kitchen waste, glass bottles and other solid waste."
"Industrial sources: chemical residue, fly ash, metallic waste."
Agricultural residues: fertilizers and pesticides 
Soil erosion also leads to the degradation of soil due to uprooting of plants and over-grazing.
"Noise can be simply defined as ""unwanted sound""."
It is generally higher in urban and industrial areas than in rural areas.
using heavy machinery are exposed to high noise levels for long period of work hours everyday.
Intensity of sound is measured in a unit called decibel or dB.
The lowest intensity of sound that human ear can hear is 10 dB.
"Look at the figure , some sources of noise pollution is seen there ."
Radiation is a form of energy travelling through space.
Radiation pollution is the increase in over the natural back ground radiation.
 There are many sources of radiation pollution
 nuclear wastes from nuclear plants 
mining and processing of nuclear material
the worse case of nuclear pollution was the Chernobyl disaster in Russia occurred in 1986 but the effects still longer today.
Define pollution.
Name different types of Pollution.
Name any two sources of water pollution.
Emphasis  was  given  to  respect  for  natures  and  concept  of environment harmony.
"Vedas, Puranas and great epics also learnt to respect tress and rivers, kindness to birds and animals and reverence for the presence of divinity in nature."
Atrharva veda instructs 'Apo Vata Ashadhayah' means air and water are sacred and  like natural medicines and so it is very important to keep clean and pure.
"Another  hymns  of  Rigveda  says  -  if  the  forests/plants  are destroyed, it will adversely affect the clean air "
 also the mineral wealth as trees and plants are also the saviors of the precious wealth contained inside the earth.
"Other religions too enshrine respect for nature and environmental protection rest (plants and trees), sunlight, morning atmosphere etc are referred as purifiers of environment."
The  Vedas  also  mention  about  the  ozone  layer  as  earth  is surrounded by a membrane which is very thick.
the function of this layer is to protect earth from harmful rays or radiations.
Yagya  (yajna)  is  a  scientific  process  of  sublimation  and transformation of healthy constituents of plants/herbal medicines into  vapor  phase  and  their  expansion  and  dissipation  in  the surrounding air.
"It also helps in maintaining balance of oxygen, carbon-dioxide "
also reducing the harmful growth of poisonous and ozone layer depleting gases and radiations etc.
Yagya  (yajna)  is  also  the  source  of  shower  of  water  and  air purifying  and  vital  elements  from  the  upper  layer  of  earth's atmosphere and space beyond.
"Fire ritual of yagya has power to remove  all  the  faults,  impurities  and  pollution  and  purifies everything around."
"It is also most effective eco-friendly methods of  removing  harmful  germs,  bacteria  and  other  carriers  of infections and diseases."
"It is mentioned in yajurveda, yagya best means of purification of environment, maintenance of ecological balance and healthy and happy survival and all round well beings of all living beings and plants and trees."
Control of water Pollution Water is a powerful medium of purification and also source of energy.
"A narration in Manu Smriti suggests that One should not cause urine, stool and cough in water."
"Anything which is mixed with thses unpious object, bold and poison, should not be thrown into water."
It means we should not pollute our water resources.
Vedic period people took precautions to use water free from all sorts of impurities 
and that great care was taken for an adequate supply of unpolluted water.
"They must have had a plentiful supply of  water  for  drinking,  cooking,  washing  and  other  purposes."
People of ancient and medieval India put great efforts to test and analyse different types of water collected in different places and in different seasons.
Susruta has explained the six types of pollutants and has given the ill-effects caused by consuming or using water with these doshas.
"He has prescribed a few substances like clearing nuts, gomedaka, lotus-bulbs, moss, pearls, thick cloth etc, with which impurities including suspended ones can be removed from water."
"Boiling, making sunlight fall on the water, adding fragrance by dropping flowers in the water, dropping red hot iron balls, sand, lump of mud(alum) in the water and allowing it to clear are some methods prescribed for purification of water."
Water heated by the sun's rays is considered to be very good like gangam water
"when heated by the sun, the bacteria etc. are destroyed "
"and when cooled in night, water becomes soft and light."
"If the water gets polluted and becomes pungent, bitter, tasteless, saline  or  malodorous,  it  is  advised  that  arjuns,  musta,  ustra, nagakesara, kosalaka, amalaka together with ketakaphala should be thrown in the water."
"This will male the foul water transparent, tasteful and fragrant and in addition will confer on it many other good qualities"
"A lump of earth (alum), well-mixed with phana, mustaka, ela, ustra and chandana should be baked well in the fire of khadira and then dropped in water,"
Water should be brought in containers made of coconut shells or in earthern or copper pots.
Water from the containers should be poured out through tubes.
The containers may be wrapped in wet cloths or kept on clean sand to maintain the coolness of water.
How many Pollutants observed by Susruta in water?
What is the best way to purify atmospheres in Vedic period
"Earth, water, fire, air ether mind and false ego all together these eight constitute my separated material energies."
Do not disturb the sky and do not pollute the atmosphere.
"Ancient India civilization always believed to live in harmony with  nature  and  traditionally  toned  hygienic  environment  as described  in  Vedas,  Upnishads,  Smiritis  and  Dharamstras."
Worshipping nature as deity and recognizing earth as mother as they are the basic necessities of human kind to exist on earth shows a kind of conservation ethics.
"From our ancient literatures and  kautila's Arthshastra,  it  was  mentioned  that  maintaining sanitation of habitat was essential and inevitable."
India was rural and pastural and even Rigveda there is no mention urban life.
Later on some examples are seen in Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa.
The  sanitization  and  waste  management  techniques  spread through trade route around India.
Drainage systems are considered as a corner stone of urbanism development in the history of  India.
 Recent excavations at Harappa have shown to have flushed toilets in almost every house and were linked to the respective  city's central drainage network and the solid waste was discharged into a rectangular  jar soak pit for collection .
The waste management techniques used in ancient India were successful enough to recycle the household wastage.
Burning of wood or coal was used for cooking purpose and the carbon was decomposed underground.
Used to consume freshly prepared food so no packaging was done to pollute the environment.
Villagers  dug  a  small  hole  in  the  backyard  to  collect  daily household waste and covered it with mud/sand till pit got levelled.
"After a few months, this land was used in the farms as compost."
Some big holes were made near a big tree and the waste was collected  in  it.
The  waste  contents  were  mixed  with  the  mud during  watering  of  the  tree  and  were  slowly  converted  into compost.
"Returning of food waste to soil was a common practice since  vedic  times,  sustainably  recycling  nutrients  and micronutrients."
The real problem of waste started through the invention of plastic in the name of modernization.
The most favoured waste management is prevention and the least favoured is disposal of waste by storing or burying waste.
Reuse and recycling of waste material is an effective way of reducing air  pollution  
"Segregation of waste, pre-treatment at source, sterilization of rooms will help in checking indoor pollution."
Disposal of waste should be done in a scientific way.
"Vedic  scriptures  also  mentioned  the  occurrence  of environmental  pollution  including  air,  water  and  soil pollution "
"because of artificial equipments, machines and toxic 'unnatural substances."
The  presence  of  unwanted  substances  in  a  concentration which  can  have  an  adverse  effect  on  organisms  and environment is called pollution.
All human activities from cooking at home to the working of highly mechanized industries contribute to air pollution.
"Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies like lakes, rivers, ground water and oceans"
Soil pollution is caused by the addition of chemicals or other unwanted substances in the natural soil environment 
 Arharva veda  instructs 'Apo Vata Ashadhayah' means air and water are sacred and like natural medicines 
and so it is very important to keep clean and pure.
Reuse and recycling of waste material is an effective way of reducing air pollution 
"Reduce, Reuse, Repair and Recycle be our guiding principles for reducing waste generation."

"Residential gardening takes place near the home, in a space referred to as the garden."
"Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located on a roof, on a balcony, in a windowbox etc ."
"Gardening is also undertaken in non-residential areas, such as parks, amusement parks, and around tourist attractions and garden hotels."
"For  these,  gardeners  are  appointed  to  maintains  these gardens."
Qualities of a Gardener 
to have a love of nature and the outdoors.
• physical fitness and the ability to undertake manual labour.
• knowledge about plants and the environment.
• good management skills.
to be practical and have good problem-solving skills.
the ability to use appropriate tools.
To do any activity well it is advised to use appropriate tools.
Some of the tool of gardening are described below
"A trowel in general is a small, single-hand implement for digging, scooping, spreading, or otherwise manipulating dirt or other bulk materials."
"In  gardening  and  horticulture,  they  are  useful  in planting and potting"
also useful for digging holes and breaking up clumps of soil.
"Gardening trowels typically have strong, narrow blades with sharp points."
"They are good for making rows, furrows and weeding."
" A shovel is a tool for digging, lifting, and moving bulk materials  such as soil, coal, gravel etc."
It is a hand tools consisting with a broad blade fixed to a medium-length handle.
Shovel blades are usually made of sheet steel or hard plastics and are very strong.
Shovel handles are usually made of wood.
This is a multipurpose garden maintenance tool
"it is a rake, shovel and soil sift in one."
"This lightweight tool is ideal for breaking up soil and clods, mix fertilizer, smooth out soil clearing up weeds or fallen autumn leaves and much more."
" They are used to make rows, furrows, seed holes, cover seeds, till soil and cut and remove weeds"
"Loppers  are  a  type  of  scissors  used  for  pruning  twigs  and small  branches,  like  secateurs  with  very  long  handles."
They are  the  largest  type  of  manual  garden  cutting  tool.
"They  are usually  operated  with  two  hands,  and  with  handles  typically between 30 centimetres and  91 centimetres long to give good leverage."
A  good  barrow  is  strong  yet  light  enough  to  easily  transport when full.
"It used for  carrying bags, fertilizers, plants and garden waste."
"A small knife is often needed in the garden for cutting string, sticks and flowers, trimming fruit and vegetable plants and many other jobs."
Any  garden  needs  constant  maintenance  and  a  good  garden secateurs is an invaluable tool to have for any pruning jobs.
These help protect the hand while working and to avoid unwanted blisters
Buckets used for transporting water etc.
Watering Cans used  for watering of plants
 A garden hose is essential for carrying water to the garden.
Hoses are usually made from rubber or vinyl
rubber is more expensive.
Make sure the hose is long enough to reach comfortably to all parts of the garden.
Start by washing the dirt off your tools with a garden hose by scrubbing with a wire brush.
Dip the tools in a diluted solution of any household bleach.
Turpentine can be used for any items that might be covered in sap and vinegar can be used to soak items coasted in rust.
Rub wooden handles with linseed oil.
"Hoes, shears, scissors, knives, loppers, prunes, and shovels all need to be sharpened sometime and regularly."
Store Tools  in  a  clean  dry  place  after  cleaning  and wiping them
Determine the type of soil you have and plan to get the required mix.
Clay soil will hold water but does not drain well.
It is usually highly alkaline and will need a lot of organic matter added to it.
Sandy soil will drain well but requires frequent watering.
It will also need to be improved with organic material.
Very organic soil is usually highly acidic and will have both good drainage and moisture retention.
You may need to add lime to increase the pH level.
Add  plenty  of  organic  material  to  your  soil  before  you plant.
Dig and aerate your soil each season.
""
Check your soil for good drainage by digging a hole
 a foot deep (30cm) and filling it with water.
The water should drain out in around 15 minutes.
If it takes much longer or drains too fast the may need to take steps to rectify it.
Buy seeds of a reputable seed company.
You can select seed available at your home also.
Choose a variety that will do well in your climate.
When selecting seeds ensure that they free of the following:
Timing is important- not too cold and wet to sow
"Temperature matters - As a rule, the seed of most (but not all) Notes species germinates best in gentle heat."
"Moisture is important - As a rule, most seeds' germination and growth depends on keeping the soil just slightly damp to the touch."
Humidity is important for successful germination.
Light levels matter.
"Depth and spacing matter - Sowing seed too deeply is a classic beginner's mistake, as is sowing too densely."
Consider the space available to grow.
Plants need space to grow and to promote health with airflow to reduce disease like mildew and blight.
"If you have a small garden, look for bush, compact or container varieties to grow."
Water the plants regularly.
"In the summer season, you need to water them at least once every day."
Plants lose a lot of water during this summer and they can wither or have stunted growth if they are not well watered.
With regard to the amount of water to use one needs to consider the species of the flowers and their water requirements.
Other factors that you can consider are the type of soil in the garden and the amount of rainfall in the area.
Excess watering and poor watering methods can cause fungal diseases on plants.
"Garden  soils  lose  fertility  with  time,  subjecting  plants  to inadequate nutrients."
"When you notice signs of low soil fertility, you need to immediately apply appropriate fertilizers."
The best fertilizers for flowers are the water-soluble or liquid ones.
Some fertilizers can scorch plants 
when used incorrectly like when high amounts are used or when applied at the wrong time.
"To avoid this problem, follow the manufacturer's directions for the fertilizer."
Perform  a  soil  test  to  help  pick  the  correct  fertilizer.
Organic fertilizers  take  longer  to  release  in  the  soil
but they create a healthier soil over time.
Mulch  is  any  material  that  is  spread  or  laid  over  the  surface of  the  soil  as  a  covering.
"It  is  used  to  retain  moisture  in  the soil, suppress weeds, keep the soil cool, prevent soil erosion and adds nutrients to the soil"
"Organic mulches also help improve the soil's fertility, as they decompose."
For  mulches  choose the  ones  that  do  not  spoil  the  beauty  of  the  plants.
"Some recommended mulches include grass, leaves, wood chips, and polythene papers."
Weeds compete for nutrients available in the soil and the with useful plants.
Besides they can harbor pests and diseases.
"to get the best from your flowers, you need to remove any weeds that grow in your garden."
"If you are growing flowers in a smaller garden or using pots and vases, you can control weeds by just uprooting them."
"For a larger garden, you need to use garden tools like a hoe and pick"
you need to weed after every week.
"Sunlight is the source of energy in plants, and so you need to ensure  that  the  plants  are  getting  enough  of  it."
"Some  flowers need many hours of sunlight every day while others, like the indoors, need just a few hours."
So you need to know the light requirements of your plants in order to provide them with enough light.
"Pests can easily kill  plants, so it is important to prevent them from attacking the garden."
"You can prevent some pests by keeping the garden free from weeds, refuse and  by installing barriers and traps."
"Some pests that you should be aware of include bugs, mites, aphids, whiteflies, and gnats."
"If  plants  are  attacked  by  pests,  one  needs  to  use  appropriate pesticides to kill the harmful organisms."
"Like  pests,  diseases  are  quite  harmful  to  flowers."
"Most  plant diseases  are  caused  by  fungi,  bacteria,  and  viruses."
you can  prevent  fungal  diseases  by  avoiding  excessive  use  of water in your garden and by using clean weeding and pruning tools.
"Some animals, like cows and goats can destroy plants by feeding on  the  foliage."
Other  animals  like  dogs  and  cats  can  also  be destructive on garden plants.
The best way to protect your garden from animals is to install a barrier.
Pinching is the process of removing stem tips to encourage lateral growth and promote good shape.
It is recommended to pinch back  plants to increase branching and promote the formation of more flowers.
Thinning is the process of removing excess plants to create room for the growth of the remaining plants.
"On the other hand, culling is the process of removing undesirable plants (inferior, weak, infested or diseased) to give more room for the remaining plants or to control pests and diseases."
Staking is done to provide support for plant stems.
It involves fixing a stake or rod in the ground and tying a stem on it.
done on plants with weak stems or where plants are required to grow in a certain direction
Deadheading is the process of removing old or dead flower heads from a plant to encourage more blooming.It can also keep the plants looking tidy.
Soils  lose  their  physical  properties  with  time
lowering their capacity to sustain plant growth so it needs to be replaced
Organic manures are composed of dead plant and animal remains and contain plant nutrients.
They are applied to the soil to increase crop production.
"In the farms manures from cow or buffalo dung, compost  made  from  plants,  leaves  and  kitchen  waste,  and leguminous crops used as green manures"
Maintains soil fertility level.
Increases  the  nutrient  level  of  the  soil  by  improving  soil structure and aeration.
Helps to retain plant nutrients and moisture.
Well-decomposed compost buffers soil reaction and controls soil temperature.
Increases soil microbial activity which helps mineralization of applied chemical fertilizers
making them more available to crops.
Arrange composting material in a pit or heap.
"If composting is done in a heap, the site should be levelled and protected from rain by a roof so that nutrients will not drain off."
Compost is decomposed by fungi and bacteria.
"For proper microbial growth, add starter materials like wood ash."
"Add enough water to keep compost moist; the material should be spongy - not too dry, not too wet."
Turn the compost pit or heap at 30-40 day intervals for proper aeration.
Cover the compost pit or heap with mud or straw or plastic sheets.
This practice enhances decomposition.
Crumbly
Does not stick in the hand.
Dark grey or blackish in color 
Original material cannot be distinguished
One can find many job opportunities or get self employed in Horticultue.
"Horticulture is the branch of agriculture that deals with  the  art,  science  and  business  of  plant  cultivation."
This includes plants that are edible and ornamental.
"It also includes conservation  of  plants,  restoration,  landscape,  design  and construction."

A tailor is a person who cuts and sews fabrics to make garments.
Sewn garments can further decorated be with embroidery also.
Can you imagine stitching without needle and thread? Or cutting without scissors?.
No it is impossible
Do you have any idea of the steps involved in dress making.
"Garment construction involves many steps like cutting, stitching and finishing etc."
so we require many tools and equipments.
In this lesson you will learn about the tools used in sewing and some basic hand stitches 
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
identify and list the different tools used for hand stitching and embroidery
use the basic hand stitches to sew and repair garments
work and use the decorative stitches to decorate an item of clothing
appreciate the scope of basic tailoring.
"Tailoring is the art of designing, cutting, fitting, and finishing clothes."
A tailor depends upon his tools.
He requires a few tools.
"They  are-  a  pair  of  scissors,  a  sewing  machine,  a  measuring tape, a sharp needle, a thimble on his middle finger, some thread reels and balls, and an iron press."
"A tailor is someone who sews, joins, or finishes clothing or other items. They may create new pieces  of  clothing  from  patterns  and  designs  or  alter  existing garments to fit customers better."
Tailoring includes the following activities
Measuring clients to ensure that clothing will fit properly
Cut and measure fabric according to a pattern or design
"Sew clothing by hand, using a needle and thread or with sewing machines"
Finish  and  decorate  the  garments  using  trimmings  and embroidery 
"A basic knowledge of stitching/ hand stitching with needle can help us to handle small repair like tears, loose/lost buttons or hooks."
You could also decorate and make a simple dress look expensive and beautiful by embroidering it.
Every craft requires its specific tools and equipment.
Let us list and study some of the basic tools of stitching by hand.
Scissors—You will need them to cut your fabric and thread.
Measure Tape—You will need them to take measurements.
Needles  and  Threader—Needles  are  used  to  sew  and embroider.
They  are  available  in different  sizes  (Numbers).
They are chosen in accordance with the thickness of the fabric.
The  threader  helps  make  the  threading  of  the  needle  easy and quick.
Thimble—The thimble is worn on your middle fingertip to protect it while you push your needle.
Threads—You can't sew without threads! 
The most used are cotton or polyester
Rulers—They are used for taking straight measurements
Pressing while sewing makes the sewing neater and easier.
The Sprayer is used to moisten the fabric to be ironed to help give a neat finish
"It  is  used  to  cut/rip  out  seams,  to  open buttonholes etc."
It is used to transfer pattern markings to the fabric by leaving a fine imprint on smooth fabrics.
Study the table given below and fill in the columns as required.
Hand sewing needles are available in all kinds of shapes and forms.
"In most cases, the larger the size number, the smaller the needle."
Finer needles are used with thin or delicate fabrics while heavier needles are used with thicker fabrics.
There are tips and tricks that can help make threading a needle less difficult.
"For example, place a white background behind the needle to make it easier to see the eye and thread."
Cut the thread with sharp scissors (to prevent frayed ends) at a 45-degree angle.
"Be sure to stiffen the thread using water, saliva, or wax."
"If you still have difficulty, use a needle threader."
"Hold  both  the  needle  threader  and  needle  in  one  hand,  while keeping the loop of wire on the needle threader through the eye of the needle."
Insert your threadthrough the loop of wire on the needle threader.
Pull the thread through the loop so that you have a tail of least a few inches in length.
"Place the end of the thread on your pointer finger, holding it in place with your thumb."
Wrap the thread around your pointer finger a couple of times.
"Using your thumb, slide the thread loops towards the end of your pointer finger."
The loops will wrap around each other as they travel toward the end of your pointer finger.
"Slide the loose knot to the end of the tread, then tug on the thread to tighten the knot."
"The running stitch is the most basic of the hand sewing stitches, and has many variations."
"It's used for gathering, mending, and tucking."
"Depending on its use, you an either knot your thread or take a couple of back stitches to lock it into place."
"In its longer form, it becomes a basting stitch."
Bring your needle through the fabric from the back (wrong side).
"Once the knot hits the fabric, make a stitch to the left or right."
Bring the thread back up and repeat.
"Uneven Basting Use the same technique as the running stitch, but make longer stitches (between 1/4 inch and a 1/2 inch)."
" Before  sewing  machines,  all  clothes  were  stitched  using backstitches."
"Working from left to right, take a small stitch, then insert the needle at the end of the previous stitch"
bringing it out beyond the point where the thread emerges.
"Continue, always inserting the needle in the end of the previous stitch."
Fasten thread with needle pointing to the left (right) take up a very small bit of the garment fabric just above the fold of the hem.
Try to make your stitch very small as it will be visible from the right side.
Pull up thread.
"Move the needle a bit to the right (left) - about 1/4"" to 1/2""."
Take up a small amount of the hem fabric with the needle still facing to the left (right).
Continue to complete hem.
You can use this stitch to finish hems with fabric that doesn't fray.
"Working from left to right, take tiny stitches on the hem, and then on the garment. Keep the stitches loose and even."
They will appear as crosses on the wrong side and small stitches on the right.
This is a tiny and almost invisible
"when it's done right, and with care on both sides."
Bring the needle through the fold of the hem and pick up a thread of fabric at the same point. Make the stitches about a 1/2 inch apart and fairly loose.
Fasten the thread on the wrong side of the fabric
"then with the right side facing upward, insert the needle from back to front through the fabric 1/8 inch from the edge."
"Wrap the working head around behind the eye end of the needle, then behind the point."
"Pull the needle through, bringing the knot to the fabric edge."
Continue the process
Until making closely spaced stitches and knot.
"The eyelet version( See above) is worked in a circle, with the wrapped edge to the inside."
This blanket stitch variation has at least a 1/4 inch spacing between stitches.
This stitch got its name from being used to create flower stems and it is  good for working curved lines.
Start  by  creating  one  straight  stitch  forward.
"Then,  bring  the needle and thread up underneath the fabric, but instead of going through the center of your initial stitch, go just to the side of the stitch."
"When you're filling in leaves, it's likely you want the design to have a smooth appearance."
"This stitch adds a nice raised texture, and gets the job of filling the big area quickly."
"First, draw out the shape you want to fill to use as a guide."
"With your needle and thread , create one stitch that extends from one end of the shape to the other."
Bring the needle up again just next to the opposite side of the initial stitch.
"Keep the stitches close to one another, as required to fill the pattern or design you are working with."
"First, bring the needle and thread up through the fabric."
Then wrap the thread around the needle twice.
Hold the end of the thread taut and bring the needle down just next to the space where it came through the fabric.
Keep holding the thread taut as you pull the needle through.
You can vary the size of your French knots by wrapping the thread around the needle anywhere between one and three times.
"First, pull your needle and thread up through the fabric"
then insert it going down right beside where you first came up.
Don't pull the thread all the way through the fabric; allow it to form a loop.
Bring the needle up through that loop (this holds it from being pulled all the way through the fabric) and pull.
"To make the next chain stitch, place the needle either directly in the hole you just stitched"
"or close to it, and pull through to create another loop."
"Again, don't pull the thread completely through the fabric. Pull the needle up through the loop to hold it and pull."
Repeat the steps to continue the chain.
"When you reach the end, create a small stitch over the loop to secure it."
"This  variation  of  the  chain  stitch  is  often  referred  to  as  the ""detached chain stitch"" or ""lazy daisy."""
"Just like the chain stitch, take your needle and thread and create a stitch, but before you pull the thread all the way through the fabric, allow it to form a loop."
Bring the needle up through that loop in order to tether it from being pulled all the way through the fabric.
Create a small stitch over the top of the loop.
Space out the next loop or use the stitch to create a daisy.
Continue as desired.
"Another way to work the chain stitch is the feather stitch, which uses the second stitch to fasten the loop of the previous one."
This particular chain variation works well when you want to cover more space.
Start by bringing the needle and thread up through the fabric and creating a straight stitch.
Don't pull the thread all the way through; allow a loop to form and bring the needle up through that loop.
Space  the  next  stitch  over  in  the  opposite  direction  from  the previous stitch.
Create another loop by not allowing the thread to go completely through the fabric.
Pull the needle up through the loop and repeat on the opposite side.
"Bring the needle up in the bottom left hole, reinsert it at the top right to create a diagonal stitch."
"Bring the needle back up directly below its current position, in the next hole down."
Take it back through the fabric in the diagonal hole to the right.
Continue in this way across the row.
"To complete the stitches on the journey back, bring the needle up in the bottom right and take it back down through the top left hole to make the cross."
"when working this stitch, mark parallel lines using a pencil."
"Working left to right, bring the needle up through the fabric at the lower left (point 1) and work a stitch diagonally to the upper right (point 2)."
"Bring the needle up again to the left of the insertion hole (point 3), and then work a stitch diagonally to the lower right (point 4)."
"Come back up to the left of this (point 5), which becomes the new point ."
"(point 1), so you are ready to repeat to the end of the row"
Two important factors to keep in mind are
Button placement
Button attachment technique
"For a flat button, start by sewing an ""X"" on the fabric where you want to place the button."
Sew up and down through the holes in the button several times.
"On the final pass, bring your needle and  thread  only  up  under  the  button."
Wrap  the  thread  tightly around the base of the button a few times.
Pass the needle through this bundle a time or two.
Then bring the needle back to the back side of the fabric.
Stitch through the stitches to form a loop and make a knot.
A buttonhole should be long enough so the button can slip easily through  the  hole  without  strain  or  excessive  wear.
Normally length of the buttonhole should be equal to the diameter of the button  plus  thickness  of  the  button .
Decide upon your buttonhole placement.
Mark your fabric with a common pin.
Measure the size of your button
Cut a tiny slit in your fabric
Stitch around the opening of the buttonhole.
"Using double thread, stitch a tight blanket stitch. Place one stitch close next to another"
Thread a hand sewing needle and knot the thread.
Use a double thread unless the fabric is very thin.
Sew the holes on the end of the hook to the fabric
sew using simple in and out loops of thread or sew with a buttonhole/blanket stitch.
A minimum of six pieces of thread on each part of the hook and the eye is advisable.
More or less can be used depending on the strength of the thread.
Sew the neck of the hook to the fabric to keep the hook laying on the fabric.
Sew a couple of tack stitches to end the sewing.
Knot the thread and cut the thread.
Lay the garment flat and position the eye so the garment lies flat with the eye in the hook.
Sew the metal loops to the fabric in the same manner that you sewed the hook.
"On a loop eye, sew the loop down to the fabric at the end of the fabric, if the loop exceeds the edge of the fabric."
Eyelets are small round holes punched in the goods and worked around over and over.
"Thread  a  sewing  needle  with  a  double  or  single  thread, depending on the weight of the fabric."
Fasten the thread at the desired end of the eye location.
Create a loop by bringing the needle down into the opposite desired end of the eye.
Repeat to have four to six strands of thread bar.
"Bring the needle to the top of the fabric, at one end of the bar."
"Wrap the thread bar, creating a thread loop that the thread is brought through, similar to a blanket stitch"
repeating this process to cover and secure the thread bar.
"After covering the entire thread bar, fasten the thread at the end of the thread loops."
A snap fastener (also called press stud) is a pair of interlocking discs commonly used in place of buttons to fasten clothing.
A circular lip under one disc fits into a groove on the top of the other
holding them fast until a certain amount of force is applied.
Stitch through the holes at the edges of the snap using simple loops or blanket stitch.
"when working with needles, pins and knitting needles"
"Keep needles and pins at a certain place (a special box, cushion, etc.)"
"do not leave them at the workplace, never take the needle, pins in your mouth and do not stick them in the clothes."
Keep your eyes on the needle.
Be safe while ironing.
Make sure your nails are trimmed and hands washed.
Use appropriate cutting tools.
Handle scissors with caution.

State whether true or false
"For working of Herringbone stitch, mark parallel lines using a pencil."
"Never take the needle, pins in your mouth and do not stick them in the clothes."
Eyelets are big square holes finished at the edges
A buttonhole should be much bigger than the button
Repeat to have one to two strands for making the thread bar

 The Bizu Dance is a dance of the Chakma tribe of  Tripura.
Bizu means Chaitra Sankranti or the end of the Bengali  calendar year.
It is performed to welcome the New Year.
"It is  very rhythm dance on dhol (drum), baajhi (flute), hengrang (a  musical instrument made from bamboo) and dhuduk (similar to the hengrang)."
Music and dance is an integral part of tribal people.
Sometimes  it  is  being  used  to  protect  the  tribal people from the attack of wild animals.
"All men, women,  children and young and old alike participate in music and dance."
"It  is  associated  with  season,  festivals  and  other  community festivals."
"Musical  notes  are  drawn  from  sounds  of  birds,  animals,  tress,  water  flow,  air,  sound  coming  out  of  instruments."
Drums and sarangi type instruments are popular.
Instruments are  locally  developed  by  the  musicians  themselves.
"Common  instruments are dhol, tuntuna, charchari, timki, sarangi, khartal, jaltarang, trumpet, mandri, kotoloka and kundir etc."
"Raw material  to make instruments are wooden logs, sticks, bamboo, animal  skin,  leather,  dried  vegetables  like  gourds  and  pumpkin,  horns etc."
"Tribal dances are typical and leave strong impact by their group  dance form, fluidity of changing positions, their dress code, music  and instruments."
Since each part of country many has different  tribes so their dance forms.
"Some of popular ones are Gadbha,  Kondh,  Koya  ,Saora,  kaadar  nritham,  Kurumbar  nritham,  Ghoomar etc."
How the tribal music is related to our daily life?
Write any 4 characteristics of tribal musical notes.
Write the name of any 10 musical instruments.
Write brief notes on any 2 tribal dance.
"India is a country with a lot of diversity in its Terrain, languages, religions, climate and therefore clothing and in food too."
Food in our multicultural society has been known to bring together all religions and cultures.
"Food therefore finds an important place at  almost  all  occasions  be  it  a  wedding,  birthday,  a  religious occasion, pooja, at meetings,"
"Food  is  offered  to  our family,  friends  and  colleagues  when  we  meet."
We  cook  food differently in different cultures 
food is cooked according to the availability of ingredients available in that particular region.
Once the food is cooked it is brought to the persons who will consume it which we call 'Serving'.
How food is served in India differs from culture to culture and region to region.
It is necessary to know how we can serve the food that is cooked to the guests
For example we know that in the southern and eastern states of India rice is the staple food
while in northern India roti or chapati is the staple food
this is mainly because these regions have climate suitable for growing these food grains.
Rice  items  will  therefore  be  served  very differently than serving a chapati.
Foods of India are  known for its spiciness.
"Throughout our country, spices are used generously in food that make it more palatable."
Cooked food may be served fresh or packed for carrying with the person who will consume it.
In the past few years we have developed a culture of selling the food too in packaged forms.
Food industry is one of the flourishing and profitable propositions for business today.
"Traditionally food in India was eaten while seated either on the floor or on very low stools, durries or mattresses."
Most often food was eaten with the hands using ones fingers.
"Let us understand why serving food is important, how we can serve food keeping in with our Indian tradition and also study about the traditional utensils that are used to prepare or serve food."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
explain  the  importance  of  serving  food
"different  types  of  service, serving food at home and outside"
identify various traditional utensils used for serving food
serve food systematically.
Serving of food is the stage between cooking and eating 
"and involves important roles, mannerisms, and cultural forms depending upon the traditional practices of the community to which the people belong."
Different communities have different practices
for example-we have seen that Indians emphasize on serving food with love and offering second helpings too.
Serving of food may also depend upon where and how the food is had or offered
"for example food may be had at home, restaurant, office, picnic, school etc."
 Define Serving of Food.
 Give an example of how food is served at your house.
Food may be packaged and sent to individuals from one place to another .
"like our famous dabbawalas of Mumbai, it may be served to children in schools during the midday meal or may be served in front of the dinners in a restaurant or may be served to the families at home"
Serving at a hotel may be from a Kitchen from where food is carried to a side table or a trolley.
"Food is served to the persons or the persons may serve themselves from the serving utensils containing food, from the Cooking utensils."
In a restaurant the guests sit at a table with family and friends and are served food by the waiters from the restaurant.
"In restaurants food may be served/ordered à la carte, that is, the diners  may  choose  items  from  a  menu  or  the  food  could  be arranged in a Buffet and the guests could serve themselves from the food arranged on large common tables."
""
""
When food is laid out  on  large  common  tables  so  that  the  guests  can  serve themselves is called a Buffet arrangement.
buffet-Is a meal at which food is placed on a long table a people serve themselves.
In some Indian households women have often been seen serving children and men first
"Food  at  home  may  be  served,  like  we  mentioned  above,  at  a table or to the people sitting on the floor in many households."
 many Indian families use cutlery such as spoons or forks etc for eating 
but many also do not use any cutlery and use their hands to eat food.
The type of cutlery used is chosen based on  the  type  of  food  that  we  eat.
"Since  Indian  food  comes  in different shapes, sizes and textures"
we often prefer to use all our fingers to eat food 
"in order to enjoy the taste, smell, sight and touch of food."
"When the individual sits on the floor, the food may be served  on leaves, Thalis etc "
at many places food may also be served on a long table.
"We  are  aware  that  our  ancestors  cooked  food  in  earthenware because there would have been no plastic, steel or aluminium "
also science has proven that cooking in Matkas or clay pots adds several minerals to food thereby making food healthy 
"by doing this, food is made free from contamination of undesirable metals."
Clay pots are also alkaline in nature 
so they mix well with acidic food and balance its pH level.
These utensils keep the liquids cool in warm areas.
"Small bowls may be used to make curd, kulfi and also serve in them."
Earthern kullads which are environment friendly 
they are  used to serve water or tea.
Leaves are used for serving food which has been the practice from ancient times.
Fresh leaves even today are used as a plate for eating.
This is a common practice in many parts of our country such as in south and west India.
A large number of people from southern states use Banana leaves as they are easily available
these leaves are large and thick
they can easily serve as a plate.
In north India food or very often prasad may be served in donaas or pattals
these pattals are made of dried leaves.
This is mainly because banana leaves are found in abundance in the southern India as compared with  north.
Nowadays  however  plates  and  bowls  made  from thermocol  or  plastic  are  used  
which are not safe for our environment 
as they are not biodegradable.
"Examples of common leaves that may be used are Plantain leaf, Bastard teak leaf, Ricinus communis leaf, Calotropis leaf, Castor leaf, Secrete milky sap leaf, Lotus petals, Tahitian screwpine leaf, Stereospermum suaveolens leaf etc."
The order and type of foods served in a banana leaf varies from culture to culture.
The banana leaf is placed in a way that the broader side comes on the right.
"Things that are less used like as salt and on the right are usually gravy, rice, curd ,pickle and curry that are more requently accessed.  "
Gravy items are served on the top side away from the diner. Dry items such as Rice and papad are usually served on the bottom side.
Serving food on a plate also begins from the left hand and moves to the right.
"We have often seen that items such as salt, lemon, chutney raita and pickle that are eaten in less quantity are placed on the left side, right side usually has dry vegetables and in the centre are placed rice or rice items."
Gravy items are generally served in small bowls or katoris.
 Food from the Midday Meal kitchens in each area are brought to different schools
it is prepared fresh in school  in the morning.
"The food that is dal rice, chana, poorie alu, etc are served to children who either sit in rows on mats or line up in front of the person who ladles out the food into their lunch boxes."
""
Belan is a round hard surface 
"made of stone, marble, wood, plastic for rolling a chapati/roti."
It is accompanied by Belan
belan is used to roll the dough into a flat chapati on the Chakli.
A Belan is often made of wood and  may  come  in  different  sized elongated shapes.
Tava is a round shaped utensil that is used to make chapati.
"We have often seen them made from clay, aluminium, iron etc."
"We can also make paratha, chela or dosa on the tava."
A tava is made from thick iron 
"however we see a tava in different shapes, sizes and materials"
 for example tavas today can be seen made in non- stick so that the food does not stick to it.
Degchi is used mainly for boiling or cooking gravy food items.
It is made of Aluminium or copper or brass.
The shape of degchi helps to distribute the heat evenly.
Is a  perforated  spoon  that  allows  the liquid/oil to retain in the utensil. 
this is often used for deep frying and may also be used for serving food.
"this may made be from steel, iron, aluminum or brass."
Handi is a cooking utensil which is generally used for cooking rice  or  meat.
"Handi  may  be  made  with  clay, Aluminum  and sometimes steel or brass."
Like Degchi the shape of Handi helps to cook food quickly.
""
"From the nutritional perspective to taste, clay pots are well-suited"
clay pots are well-suited for all types of food
It is said that cooking  in  clay  pots  involves  the  slow  cooking  process  that improves  the  quality  and  taste  of  food 
they also balances the nutrients.
Khunti  is  a  metal  spoon 
its in the shape of a spatula 
it is used only for frying.
It is ideal for flipping food while frying 
"it is often made of steel, iron, aluminium, brass, wood and silicon "
now silicon to be used with non stick cookware.
are tongs that are used for taking hold of any object in the kitchen.
For example it could be used for puffing up chapati on the flame 
 maybe a sturdier one could be used for holding a small utensil that does not have a handle and is too hot to lift.
Sil batta or Shil noda is a perfect stone grinder
it is used to grind masalas and chutneys 
 Bengali curved cutting blade
this blade is fixed on a wooden platform and is used for chopping food.
it is mainly used for frying.
It is mostly prepared from Aluminium  or  Iron.
These  are  often  used  for  preparing vegetables without gravy 
in this vegetables can easily be tossed while cooking.

In this lesson we will discuss about the Indian dramaturgy.
Indian  dramaturgy is the product of native genius.
"In ancient India, there  were  many  forms  of  theatre  prevailing  that  belonged  to  the  indigenous tribes."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
explain the main component of dramaturgy
list the types of play (Drama)
list the stages for performing a play.
Natyshastra  is  considered  as  fifth  'Veda'  
it includes the elements of the four 'Vedas' 
"as dance from the Rig, song from the Sãma, mimicry from Yajur and passion from Atharva."
"In Natyshastra, all aspects of the theatrical art had been explained by the Bharatmuni."
He collected all the aspects of the  theatre in form of the theory from the ancient custom of oral  recitation  of  poetry  at  social  and  religious  gatherings  and  functions.
"According  to  the  Natyashastra,  the  sentiments  (Rasa),  the  psychological  states  (Bhãva),  the  histrionic  representation  (Abhinaya), the practices (Dharmi), the styles (Vãtti), the local  uses  (Pravãtti),  the  success  (Siddhi),  the  notes  (Svara),  the  instrumental  music  (ãtodya),  the  songs  (Gãnam),  the  stage  (Ranga)  are  the  main  components  of  Dramaturgy."
The Styles i.e. vritti play very important role in dramatic work.
Styles preceded the ten kinds of plays.
The varieties of  plays came into existence due to the varieties of styles.
Where nataka and  prakarana both  have  varieties  of situation and made up of all the styles

Drawing is one of the most basic ways to exercise your creativity.
the skills you gain from the activity translate to a bevy of different media.
"for this you can use  a  pencil,  pen,  crayon,  or  even  your fingers"
"Learning the fundamentals is simple to do, but like all art, they require a lot of practice to master."
"But once you do, you'll have the ability create images you're truly proud of."
There are standard drawing techniques
that you need to be familiar with as you put pencil to paper.
Some are so basic that you've probably used them before without even realizing it.
"In this  lesson  you  will  learn  about  the  basic  skills  of  drawing, drawing of shapes like circles and also understand the basics of colour."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
list the basic equipments used for drawing
explain the basic skills of drawing
"draw basic shapes such as circle, triangle, square etc."
create new colours by mixing two or more colours.
Most of us started drawing when we were young.
"Back then, materials  and  tools  were  not  that  important  to  us."
"A  standard pencil on some notebook paper would often ""do the trick""."
Some essential tools of drawng are listed blow.
They are graded from hard (H) to soft (B).
9H is the hardest 
9B is the softest
with F (for fine) and HB in the middle range.
"H pencils (2H, 3H, and 4K; they progressively become harder) are good for clear-cut, light lines, but will scratch into the surface of your paper"
"so B pencils are better for softer, tonal work."
Each grade of pencil will only produce a tone of a given darkness 
and no amount of pressure will make that tone darker.
"If you require a darker tone, you will need to switch to a softer grade of pencil. Soft pencils will give a greater range of tones than hard pencils "
and can be erased easily
without leaving an indent should you make a mistake.
It is for this reason that most drawings are made using a pencil which is HB or softer.
Coloured pencils are made in much the same way as graphite pencils.
The pigment is mixed with a clay filler and a binder.
Wax  is  added  to  act  as  a  lubricant  and  help  the  pencil  slide smoothly over the paper.
These are available in many different colours and forms.
"Some coloured pencils make sharp, definite lines"
while others are softer and can be blended more easily.
Layering colours will produce different shades and unexpected results can be achieved by using the same group of colours in different sequences
"as the name suggests, are made of charcoal and wax"
"provide fuller blacks than graphite pencils, but tend to smudge easily "
and are more abrasive than graphite
  Your standard eraser for erasing graphite.
This eraser uses friction to remove any material from the surface.
inks  available  in  a  range  of  colours
are either water-soluble or waterproof 
Water-soluble inks are not as widely available as waterproof inks.
Both inks can be blended with water to create tones.
A sketchbook is one of the most important things 
an artist can have  a book with blank pages of drawing paper.
Since  a  sketchbook is recommended for daily practice
it is important to choose one that is durable and has plenty of pages.
"Paper can be purchased as loose, single sheets or in sketchbooks and pads."
Single sheets enable you to try out several different papers 
and can be cut or torn to size according to your need
"If you are working on single sheets of paper, you will need to secure it to a drawing board."
"It might sound obvious, but make sure that the board is large enough for your paper and that its surface  is  smooth."
"An  easel  is  an  upright  support  used  for displaying and/or fixing something resting upon it, "
"In particular, easels are traditionally used by painters to support a painting while they work on it,"
"normally standing up, and are also sometimes used to display finished paintings."
Easel is put at an angle of about 20° to the vertical.
Pencils need to be sharpened with a quality pencil sharpener.
Charcoal pencils can be sharpened like graphite pencils.
Metal sharpeners work better than plastic ones.
You can also use a small knife to sharpen your pencils  8.
Felt tip pens allow the artist to create a variety of marks.
this allows the artist to create a broad range of line quality.
 this pencil are made of charcoal 
"and provide fuller blacks than graphite pencils,"
but tend to smudge easily and are more abrasive than graphite.
A very large range of pen options is available-so much so that it may seem a little overwhelming.
Technical pens are convenient to use for fast sketches
 their nibs make unvarying marks.
"Fountain  or  cartridge  pens,  roller-ball,  ballpoint,  fine  liners, and specialist art pens come with a wide range of nibs "
"All pens can create fine, flowing lines"
Drawing is both a talent and a skill.
It takes a lot of practice to become  good  at  something.
A  skill  is  something  taught  and learned
" through levels of learning, you develop expertise."
A talent is an inborn and natural inherent ability.
""
The ability to draw will come naturally for some people
their natural ability can be enhanced by further training and developing higher skill.
"For someone  who  does  not  know  how  to  draw,  they  can  gain instruction and develop skill, even to a high level of expertise."
Some basic skills of drawing are:
The First Skill: recognizing edges
"The Second Skill: recognizing - non-object shapes or ""spaces"""
"The Third - and most difficult skill - sighting, perspective"
The Fourth Skill: Judging Light and Dark
"Applied to drawing, these skills specifically become the ability to:"
"identify edges,"
"recognize spaces,"
"calculate proportions and angles,"
"judge light from shadow, and"
"the unconscious skill of ""putting it all together""."
Drawing is one of the most basic ways to exercise your creativity.
"Whether you're using a pencil, pen, crayon, or even your fingers, the skills you gain from these activity translate into a great artist."
Learning the fundamentals is simple to do
but  they require a lot of practice to master.
"But once you do, you'll have the ability create images you're truly proud of."
There are standard drawing techniques that you need to be familiar with as you put pencil  to  paper.
Some  are  so  basic  that  you've  probably  used them before without even realizing it.
The basic craft of drawing is about two things
you learn to control your hand and  to see.
Let us begin
"This approach challenges you to move your drawing tool back and forth across the paper in an even, level motion."
"Depending on how much pressure you apply, the darker your drawing will appear."
Hatching involves making tiny ticks on your page.
Make sure that each mark is parallel to the other.
"Lines that are close  together  will  look  darker,  while  lines  further  apart  will indicate  highlights."
Now  make  sure  to  try  other  directions  as well.
This  technique  is  the  logical  extension  to hatching.
"But instead of creating a series of parallel lines, have your marks intersect one another in a cross-like formation."
Scribbling allows your hand the opportunity to fly across the page.
Move your pencil in a random formation-no precise marks necessary.
"The more you scrawl all over an area, the darker it will look."
 It involves making a countless amount of tiny dots on your paper.
"Like all other approaches, the closer the dots, the darker the drawing."
"If you're using charcoal or pencil, try blending them."
"To do so, begin with the back-and-forth technique to cover your paper, and then rub the medium into it."
You can use your finger or cloth.
Another option for blending is to experiment with powdered graphite and use a paintbrush to gradually blend and build tone onto your pages.
Lines are among the most fundamental features of any drawing.
Your ability to position lines on your paper will affect the end result of your masterpiece in one way or another.
"In essence, your drawings begin with simple lines to create the guides"
rough sketches that will serve as foundation to what you're about to draw.
By understanding straight lines and mastering how to draw them
you'll realise that there's more to them than simple sticks.
You'll understand the illusion and movement they seem to create when placed with each other in a certain distance and in a certain position.
Experiment  with  curved  lines  and  you'll understand about graceful movements and fluffy figures.
"Mastering your straight and curved lines, you'll understand that combining some of them into a single pattern "
will provide you with magical results that you may have not expected.
 Connecting your lines together will give you shapes.
"Whether they're the basic 2-dimensional ones like squares and circles, the 3-D ones like spheres and boxes, or unique ones that are a result of your creative mind; shapes essentially give your drawings the volume and depth they should have."
"Understanding  shapes  is  important  because  when  combined together,  they  can  form  the  foundations  to  a  more  complex drawing."
A triangle on top of a square can turn into a house.
Ovals stacked together can become pets or wild animals.
A sphere with an irregular box below it can turn into a skull or human head.
"In short, everything you see in life can be drawn easily and properly  when  you  understand  that  they  can  be  visualised  as various shapes put together."
" Whether with your pencil, chalk, drawing inks, wax crayons or any other material you use, shading will further provide depth and volume to whatever you're drawing."
""
But shading anywhere on your canvas or paper isn't the way to achieving a stunning masterpiece.
That's why you should understand how light and shadows play with each other to learn where to put the dark areas on  your  drawing.
Flawlessly darkening some areas on your drawing while leaving white spaces will add a sense of 3- dimensional effect
" and if done properly, you could create an illusion where your drawings tend to pop out of the page as if they're real to those who see them."
Understanding Perspective Combining  your  knowledge  and  experience  on  the  above discussed  basic  elements  of  drawing
you can understand the concept of perspective in terms of drawing.
It essentially gives your drawing a sense of distance as well as provides viewers an idea of the relative space among the structures and characters in your drawing.
"Composition is a great tool to ""say"" something with a drawing, to shape its meaning or message."
Colour  theory  is  both  the  science  and  art  of  using  colour.
"It explains how humans perceive colour; and the visual effects of how  colours  mix,  match  or contrast with each other."
Colour theory also involves the messages colours  communicate;  and  the methods used to replicate colour.
Colour  is  perception.
""
""
Objects in  different reflect combinations  of  wavelengths.
Our  brains  pick  up  on  those  wavelength  combinations  and translate them into the phenomenon we call colour.
Humans see colours in light waves.
""
""
"The more light you add, the brighter the colour mix becomes."
"If you mix all three colours of light, you get pure, white light."
"In colour theory, colours are organized on a colour wheel "
"Colors are grouped into 3 categories: primary colours, secondary colours and tertiary colours."
The colour wheel consists of
"three primary colours - red, yellow, blue"
"three secondary colours - colours created when primary colours are mixed: green, orange, purple"
"six tertiary colours -colours made from primary and secondary colours, such as blue-green or red-violet."
"a line through the center of the wheel, and you'll separate the  warm  colours  from  cool  colours."
" reds, oranges, yellows are warm colours while blues, greens, purples are considered as  cool colours."
"Warm colours are generally associated with energy, brightness, and action, whereas cool colours are often identified with calm, peace, and serenity."
"When  you  recognize  that  colour  has  a  temperature,  you  can understand how choosing all warm or all cool colours can impact your message."
""
" Simply  put,  tints,  tones  and  shades  are  variations  of  hues,  or colours, on the colour wheel."
A tint is a hue to which white has been added.
"For example, red + white = pink."
A shade is a hue to which  black  has  been  added.
""
"For  example,  red  +  black  = burgundy."
""
 a tone is a colour to which black and white (or grey)  have  been  added.
This  darkens  the  original  hue  while making the colour appear more subtle and less intense.

understanding the change of seasons.
SKY (SPACE)
The sky is very large.
It is wrapped around our earth.
When we see it with our eyes we see blue color.
In Vedic culture it is called 'open space' or a place that is void.
It is one of the great five elements.
"If  we  look  at  the  expanse  of  the  sky,  from  theatmosphere around the earth, it is infinite."
"All the weather events like rain, storm etc. occurs in this atmosphere."
"All the planets, satellites, solar system and much Akash(sky) Ganges are foundin space extending beyond the same atmosphere."
Open Space
Our Akash(sky) Ganga is one of these many  Akash (sky) Gangesspread in space.
Our solar system is located in this.
We also know Akash (sky) Ganga as 'Kshir Sagar' and in English it is called'Milky Way' i.e. 'River of Milk'.
OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP
"The sun, moon and stars have a very important role in people'slife."
"In the absence of these, life of humans is not possible."
People of the older generation thought about them in different ways. 
It was believed that our earth remains fixed and the sun moves.
It rises  in  the  morning  and  sets  in  the  evening. 
"Later  it  was discovered that the Earth revolves around the Sun on its axis,while the Sun remains still at one place."
Days and nights are  formed only when the earth revolves around the sun.
"Like the earth, the moon also rotates.The moon revolves around the Earth."
"In this way, nature and human life have been created by the interconnection of the sun,moon, earth and stars."
Civilization and culture have evolved and developed from them.
Let  us  now  try  to  understand  the  solar  system  through  theinteraction of teachers and students.
"When sir entered a class, he had a globe in his hand. He startedobserving it very carefully."
"Sir asked- ""Children, do you know what is in my hand?"""
"""Yes sir, it is a globe."
"We have seen this many times, it is placed on the table of the Principal"", the childrenanswered in one voice."
"""You know, why I brought it to the class today?"" sir asked."
"""You must have brought to teach us  geography  today,""  Radha replied immediately."
"""Exactly, today I will give you information about the solar system i.e. Earth, Sun, Moon and stars, ""sir said."
"""What is this solar system, sir?""Gopal asked.""Now everyone tell! Well, everyone must have seen the sun,moon, earth and stars! ""sir asked."
"""I see many stars on the roof every day before sleeping. I try tocount them as well"", Vivek said."
"""So everyone has seen the sun, moon and stars?"""
"""Yes, sir, see it every day,"" the children said."
"""Together they are called the solar system."
"Today I will teach about it.""Sir raised the globe and showed it to everyone - ""Our earth isround like this and it rotates in this way, tilting on its axis."""
"Saying this, he moved the globe by hand."
"""Sir, what is the relationship between the Earth and the Sun?"" Aristina wanted to know."
"""You know that we all live on Earth."
So far there is no evidence of life on any other planet has been found.
It is believed that the Earth is broken by the sun.
The Sun is a large circle of fire and gases.
"It shines continuously with its light, that's why it is considered a star, ""said sir."
"""Sir, why a star? The sun is the sun, not the star,"" Aristina interrupted."
"""One who shines with its own light is called a star."
The one who receives its light from the star is called the planet. 
"Therefore our earth is the planet,because it receives its light from the sun."
As I said earlier it is round. 
It rotates from east to west on its tilted axis. 
"Along its axis, it also rotates around the Sun."
"It also revolves.This revolution of the Earth is completed in 365 days. . """
"""Does only the Earth revolve around the Sun, sir?"" Gopal asked."
"""No, there are seven more planets besides Earth - Mars,Mercury,Jupiter,Venus,Saturn,Uranus  and  Neptune,which revolve around the sun."
Earlier Pluto was also considered a planet.Now some scholars do not consider him a planet.
All these planets get their  shine  only  from  the  sun.The  bodies that orbit(revolve)around these planets are called satellites.We can call them the Sun's own family.
"These all together are called the Solar System,""sir explained in detail."
"""Well, those who orbit(revolve) the Sun, get light from it, theplanets, and the planets that revolve around satellites, ""Gopal said."
"""Got it all right.""""Do satellites revolve around the Earth as well?"" Arstu asked."
"""Only one satellite orbits (revolve) the Earth."
It is called the moon.
"By the way, many satellites also revolve around other planets."
"Like Mars have 2 satellites, 8 of Neptune, 23 ""Because the moonrevolves  around  the  earth,  that's  why  it  is  also  seen  by  us,sometimes hiding and moving out."
"But sir, why is there a difference in its size? Sometimes it lookslike a plate; sometimes it is incomplete like a laugh."
"But sir, why is there a difference in its size? Sometimes it lookslike a plate; sometimes it is incomplete like a laugh."
"""Yes, it keeps on increasing-decreasing."
"""Yes, it keeps on increasing-decreasing."
"When it starts decreasing it is completely hidden,then there is Amavasya(lunar phase) andwhen it shines completely in the sky,that night is the full moon night."
The journey from Amavasya(lunar phase) to Purnima(full moon) takes fifteen nights.
This movement of the Moon is called the phases of the Moon.
There are two phases of 15-15 nights - Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha.
The  dates  of  the  Indian calendar are based on these.
"""You must have also seen that many stars flicker in the sky."
"There are many stars in them, which are much larger thant he Sun intheir size,""sir said."
"""Then why do they appear so small, sir?"" Vivek asked."
"""Because, they are at a much higher distance from our Earth than the Sun."
You know that a distant object appears small.
"""Then there must be many groups of them sir,"" Vivek asked."
"""Is there a group of seven stars along the pole star (Dhruva tara)."""
Radha questioned.
"""Yes, it is right that the pole star in the north direction remains ina stable position and near those seven stars there is a cluster ofstars, which is named as Sapta Rishi,"" sir told."
"""Sir, sometimes a white milky way of star appears in the sky,what is that?""Arstu asked."
"""It is called Akash Ganga(milky way). Sometimes, the shootingstar also appear in the sky,"" sir explained, then said-"" All ourplanets, satellites, constellations and stars etc. revolve in space,ie the sky."
"Space means the sky, which has no end, thus youknow that all the planets including the earth rotate in the sky, sothey cannot rest on anything."
"• The sun, the earth, the moon, etc. makes up the solar system."
• The sun is a star in the solar system. It shines with its own light.
• Earth receives sunlight in the solar system.That's why earth is called a planet.
• Moon is the satellite of our Earth.It revolves around the earth. 
"• Like the moon, other planets also have satellites, which revolve around them."

4. From whom do satellites receive light?
DAY AND NIGHT OCCURRING
"""Sir you just told us that the Sun is a star, so why doesn't it showup at night? The stars shine  at night don't they?"" Raju asked."
"""You know that, we live on earth."
"The sun rises from the east and sets in the west."" sir said."
"""Wow! Who doesn't know this! I know it too,"" Gopal replied."
"""Then now must have know the truth that the sun does notactually go anywhere, nor does it come from anywhere."
It neither rises nor sinks. It keeps shining in the same place.
"It shines with its spreading light,""sir said while giving information."
"""But we see the sun rising and sinking,"" Gopal said, disagreeing."
"""Well, I have also told you that the earth is round like a globe."
"It also  revolves  around  the  sun  rotating  on  its  tilted  axis,"" sirreminded."
"""What happens with this, sir?"""
"""This is the reason why the sun rises and appears to be sinking."
That is why night and day are made.I have told you that the sunshines steadily at one place. 
The part of the earth that is exposed to the sun is filled with sunlight.
"The light which falls on the part of the earth there the day comes out, ""sir said, placing a part ofthe globe in front of the lighted bulb -"
"""Look, the part of the globe which is In front of this bulb isshining with light, while the shadow of the bulb is seen on theback of the globe."
"Thus, the light does not reach this back part. """"Meaning, the part which is hidden behind, has no light. It isconsidered night there,"" Gopal said."
"""Exactly, the Earth rotates on its axis in 24 hours.This formsnight and day."
"That is, the part of the Earth that faces the Sun, there are days. "
"Likewise, in the rest part, the night occurs. Thus,it is 12 hours a day and 12 hours a night."
Seven days are there in a week.The days of the week are also named according to theseconstellations.
"""Sir; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday arethe names of the planets, but on what basis are the names Sundayand Monday?"""
"""Why, don't you know that the Sun itself is called Ravi, it isnamed after Sunday?"
"The Moon also has a name Som, so a day is named as Monday."""
"""The day and night occur by rotation of the earth and the sun;likewise, the seasons occur by rotation."""
"""How is that sir?"""
"""This revolution of the earth is completed in 365 days."
"7 days in a week, 30 days in a month and 365 days in a year"""
"""But, you were talking about how seasons occur?"" Vivek said,interrupting in the middle."
"""Yes, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is differentduring this orbit (revolution)."
The part of the Earth which is closest to the Sun is affected by the heat which results to summer season.
"The part which is away, winters occur there."
"Due to the rotation of the cycle of seasons is formed. """
"""This way there should be only two seasons.""Gopal expressed doubt."
"""The  temperature  of  the  Earth  changes  due  to  the  increasingdistance between the Sun and the Earth. A mixture of these twoforms the other four seasons. These are called spring, monsoon,autumn and pre-winter,"" sir told."
- The earth rotates on its axis.
"- Because of it, day and night occurs."
- The Earth revolves around the sun is called revolution.
- Seasons are formed due to the mutual distance between the sun and the earth.

CONSERVATION OF FIRE(ENERGY) IN VEDAS
"Dear student, in the last lesson you read about fire i.e. energy. Inthis lesson you will read about the importance of conserving fire(energy) in the Vedas. In the Vedas, fire has been considered asthe basic platform for the creation of the environment."
The fire element is present in the form of energy in the whole world.
After reading this lesson you will be able
• To know the importance of Fire (energy) in the Vedas; and
• To understand the basic importance of Fire (energy) in the Vedas.
IMPORTANCE AND CONSERVATION OF FIRE (ENERGY) IN VEDAS
"In Vedic discussion, Fire (energy) has been called Global Fire (Vishvanar)."
Global fire means - the power that keeps the world engaged in work. 
This global fire has been considered as the main factor in the creation of the universe.
""
"In view of the protector of this global fire, sage Madhuchanda says to the Rigveda that"
"That is, one who wishes to keep the fire awake, he has knowledgeabout  the  Samaveda."
Knowledge  and  happiness  are  attained.
Some (likse) consider him as bondage.
"Here the Rigveda sages, point towards the use and protection of Fire (energy)."
Keeping awake means keeping it constant and continuously.
"In our Vedic contemplation, Fire has been considered in three forms -"
(1) Earthly fire
(2) Space fire
(3)  Ordinary (Dyosthani) Fire
The  fire  on  earth  is  called  earthly  fire.  Local  electric  fire  isconsidered as space and solar fire as ordinary fire.
"In this way, this global fire spread everywhere. "
The whole earth is resplendent with this fire.
"While enlightening the importance of fire, the sage of the Rigvedaprays to space fire to protect us from the disturbances of space."
It means that the sun should protect us from celestial disturbances;wind from space disturbances and fire from earth's disturbances.
The sage of the Atharvaveda prays for the protection from demoniacal fire -
I.e. O Sun! You protect me by viewing me.
It has been further said that O Sun illuminate us with his life force -
Punishment has been named in the Vedas to destroy and harm fire(energy).
The Atharvaveda prays that O Fire! Inure and afflict what hurts you -
"Pointing to the importance of solar energy, the kaanv sage of theRigveda says that the Continuous energy is received from the Sun -"
"That is, the rays of the sun continue to spread everywhere with the help of its superlative power."
"The energy of this sun (solar energy) is currently very important,so we need to pay attention to solar energy."
We should use the energy we get from the sun.
Sage  Gritsamad (x`rLen) of the RigVeda states that energy is produced by the rays of the sun which have the power to burn instantly.
"The importance of solar energy was pointed out in Vedic thought, which is getting our focus today."
"Today, efforts are being made to make electricity (electricity) from solar energy."
It is said in the Rigveda that the Sun makes the Som (lkse) strong.The earth also gets stronger with Som (lkse).
"In this context, Som (lkse) means the Moon at some places andSomalata at some places means the gas(Hydrogen, Helium) atsome point in reference to the Sun."
Earlier 'Richa' states that Som (lkse) makes the Sun strong. 
"Here the meaning of Som (lkse) can be derived from hydrogen and helium gas, because Som (lkse)transmits energy from the Sun."
It is said in the Yajurveda that the element of water is establishedin the sun -
"Here, the Sun of Water is (upholder). Proper combination ofhydrogen and oxygen.From the point of view of Sage above,theelement of water indicates hydrogen and the element of hydrogenonly indicates helium."
The Atharvaveda states that both fire and Som (lkse) elements are mixed in water
"Fire means oxygen here, Som (lkse) means hydrogen. In this way,the combination of the two can be considered as indicated in theAtharvaveda."
"In the Yajurveda, indicating the importance of the energy of theSun, it is said that; the Sun is the energy given by you and theenergy generated by that energy is the accomplishment of deeds,so you should combine us in the best deeds."
1. How many types of fire are mentioned in the Veda?
2. Explain the meaning of ordinary energy?
3. What does  “अग्निमीले पुरोहितम्”  mean?
• The importance of fire in the Vedas
• Reflections on fire protection in the Vedas
• The utility of solar energy in the Vedas

The Five Great Elements (Panchmahabhutas)
"Dear student, in the last lesson you've learned Vedic opinion aboutthe  creation."
In this lesson you will be able to get generalinformation about the five great elements.
"The  creation  has originated from these five great elements. On this subject, youcan also talk to your parents, grandparents or any elder memberof the family."
"Earth, water, fire, air and sky are called the fivegreat elements."
After reading this lesson you will be able to:
• get to know about the five great elements ;

THE FIVE GREAT ELEMENTS (Panchmahabhutas)
The word bhut is formed by the sum of the kt affixes in bhusattayam  (ground  metal). 
Bhut  means  one  who  has  power (existence) or one who exists. 
"Bhut are not the work of any other person, that is, there is no reason for their origin, but the existenceof everything else as a factor cause of the great elements."
"According to Maharishi Charak, these great elements are verysmall and difficult to identify by the senses."
"Because  of  their  importance  or  grossness,  they  are  known  asmahabhuta."
The  body  and  non  living  substances  of  all  livingbeings are made from them.
इह हि द्रवयं पञ्चमहाभूतात्मकम

Amazing earth.
"shabd, touch, form, taste, smell are the five properties of earth."
"Apart from the above basic essential properties, there are someother  characteristics  in  these  mahabhutas    which  we  can  feelthrough  our  senses,  for  example  in  the  earth,  water,  light,  airrespectively, we can infer the characteristics of smell, liquidity,consistency etc."
"Similarly, we can see the experience of resistancein the sky."
The Five Great Elements (Panchmahabhutas)- Properties
Sky - shabd
"Air - shabd, touch"
"fire (tej)- shabd, touch, form"
"aap (water) - shabd, touch, form, taste"

"Ahimsa means following nonviolence in action, speech and even in the mind."
Completely following nonviolence is the first Yama.
Let’s read a beautiful story of Buddha and Angulimala.
This story explains the meaning of Ahimsa and its implications in our life.
"This story begins at the University of Taxshila, which was a great university in ancient India."
Ahimsaka was a brilliant student.
He excelled in all his subjects.
"Because of this, the other students became jealous."
They made up stories to make the teacher believe 
Students told that Ahimsaka was evil.
The teacher believed these lies and decided to get rid of Ahimsaka.
The teacher knew that Ahimsaka never disrespected elders.
He always listened to his elders.
"so the teacher decided to give Ahimsaka an impossible task,"
"The teacher him that in order to graduate, he needed to collect one thousand little fingers."
"This is an impossible task, therefore Ahimsaka will never come back."
"Instead of giving up, Ahimsaka set out to collect one thousand little fingers."
"However, he soon discovered that nobody would easily give up their little fingers."
So he hid in the forest 
and murdered people to get their fingers.
He found that he had nowhere to store these fingers.
"So he put them on a string around his neck, to keep he count."
"Because of this terrific necklace of fingers, was nicknamed Angulimala, meaning ‘finger garland’."
Angulimala means ‘finger garland’.
"One day, Buddha left his monastery for a walk in the forest."
"Although Angulimala lived there, Buddha was not afraid, went there"
he continued on his way.
"On this particular day, Angulimala only had one more finger to collect, "
"so when he saw Buddha entering the forest, he dashed out to murder him "
"But no matter how fast he ran behind Buddha, he never seemed to be able to catch up with him."
We can see from this example that Buddha who was follower of nonviolence 
He transformed Angulimala into a monk who was a murderer.
Nonviolence is the personal practice of being harmless to self and also others in any condition.
So practice nonviolence.
"Satya is the second of the Yamas, following Ahimsa."
Satya means always following the truthfulness.
Let’s learn the meaning of Satya through a beautiful story of Kabir and a thief.
Kabir was a poet - saint.
One day he was humming a Doha (a couplet) as he sat weaving a cloth.
"Suddenly, the front door of his hut was thrown open and there stood a ruffian, "
"He told “Quick, show me a place to hide"""
the policeman is after me!
"Kabir calmly pointed to bales of cotton huddled together and said, “There! There you will be safe!” The introduder hid there."
Now the police man entered the hut and asked about the thief
"Kabir, in his unique style, casually pointed to the bales of cotton."
The policeman looked at Kabir’s face and  he did not take him seriously and left from there.
We can see from this example that Kabir who was follower of truthfulness transformed a thief into his disciple.
If you are not truthful to yourself it will harm you.
Asteya means non-stealing.
The Story of woodcutter which shows that how a woodcutter’s non-stealing attitude makes him rich.
This story gives you a clear understanding of non-stealing.
Kalidas was a humble woodcutter.
He was living in a village named Udayapur.
The village was near by a dense forest.
All the villagers were depending upon the forest for their livelyhood.
Kalidas was going regularly to collect firewood.
He was selling the wood in the near-by market.
With that little earning he was managing his family.
"Like usual routine, one day he had gone to the forest to collect the firewood."
He was cutting a tree near the river and His axe slipped away from his hand and was lost in the river.
That poor person got afflicted 
He had only one axe.
Thinking about the future he started weeping.
"Listening to his crying, the river goddess came in front of him"
She asked the reason for his crying.
Kalidas explained everything in detail to the river goddess.
After listening to everything the water goddess plunged into the river.
After a while she came out from the water with a golden axe.
She showed the golden axe to Kalidas and asked “Is it yours?” 
" Kalidas examined the golden axe and said “No my lord, it’s not mine.”"
"Keeping the axe aside, the river goddess plunged into the river a second time. This time she came with a silver axe."
She showed the silver axe to Kalidas and asked again “Is it yours?”  Kalidas said 
"“It is not mine. I am a poor woodcutter. How can I own a golden or silver axe!"""
 I have only an iron axe.
Listening to this the river goddess plunged once again inside the river. This time she came back with the iron axe of Kalidas.
"Seeing his axe, he showed his gratefulness and respect to the river goddess."
Seeing the honesty of Kalidas the river goddess got pleased
She gave the golden and silver axe as a gift to him with his original iron axe.
We can see from this example that the attitude of non-stealing is a boon from God.
So it is good to practice Asteya.
Who was trying to hide in Kabir’s hut?
Who was following thief?
Who was Kalidas?
Why Kalidas refused to accept golden axe?
Why angulimala was following Bhagwan Buddha?
Niyama is the second step of Ashtanga Yoga.
Niyama means personal code.
"There are five Niyama, they are Shoucha, Santhosha, Tapas, Swadhyaya and Ishwarapranidhana."
Among this five Niyama you will learn the first three which will help give you a clear understanding Niyama.
"The first of the five Niyamas is shoucha, which means cleanliness or purity."
Shoucha removes negative thoughts and makes us healthy.
"Right from small things like brushing teeth etc., fixed rules and regulations have been placed, such that utmost cleanliness prevails in the society."
Shoucham is of two kinds- 
"external cleanliness that includes the cleanliness of the body, objects and the surroundings"
the internal cleanliness that involves the purification of the mind.
Most people keep their house clean and neat.
But this attitude is not extended to the external surroundings.
Many people don't use the dustbins.
Cleanliness is not limited to keeping the house and surroundings clean.
"Human beings have made the air, water and earth dirty and polluted by their actions."
Therefore should throw garbage only into the dustbins.
"We should avoid those actions that may cause, water, noise or air pollutions etc."
"Shoucham is also internal cleansing where we abstain from jealousy, hatred, anger, greed, arrogance and develop the attitude of love, compassion, friendliness, cheerfulness etc."
Santhosha is the second of the Niyamas.
Santhosha means contentment.
The following Story of a happy man conveys a beautiful picture of Santhosha.
He was well-disposed to everyone he met.
"He always smiled, and had kind and encouraging words to say, whenever it was necessary."
"Everyone who met him, left feeling better, happier and elated."
"People knew they could count on him, and regarded him as a great friend."
"One of the village dwellers was curious to know what his secret was, and how he could always be so kind and helpful."
"He wondered, how is it that he held no grudge toward anyone, and was always happy."
Once he met him in the street.
" he asked him: ""Most people are selfish and unsatisfied."
They do not smile as often as you do; neither are they as helpful or kind as you are.
What is the secret behind it?
"The man smiled at him and replied, ""When you make peace with yourself, you can be in peace with the rest of the world."
"If you can recognize the spirit in yourself, you can recognize the spirit in everyone, "
and then you find it natural to be kind and well disposed to all.
"If your thoughts are under your control, you become strong and firm."
The personality is like a robot programmed to do certain tasks.
Your habits and thoughts are the tools and programs that control your personality.
"If you don't give attention, you will become free from being programmed"
the inner good and the happiness that reside within you will be revealed.
By this only good habits will get developed.
"But for this, it is important to work very hard."
The personality should be well developed. 
The ability to concentrate and to control the thoughts has to be strengthened.
The work is difficult and endless.
There are many walls that need to be to climbed. It is not an easy task. lamented the villager.
"He replied - Do not think about the difficulties, otherwise this is what you will see and experience."
"Just quieten your feelings and thoughts, and try to stay in this peace."
"Just try to be calm with people, and do not let yourself be carried away by your thoughts."
"""Is that all?"" asked the villager."
That person told to practice to watch the thoughts.
Try to watch your thoughts and see how they come and go.
Stay in the quietness that arises.
"The moments of peace will be brief at first, but in time they will get longer."
"The peace is also strength, power, kindness, and love.In time, you will realize that you are one with the universal power."
"Small thoughts such as selfish, small, limited ego, etc won't even touch you."
"""I will try to remember your words,"" said the villager,"
"""there is another thing that I am curious about."""
You do not seem to be influenced by the environment.
"You have a kind word for everyone, and you are helpful."
People treat you well.
Being good and being kind do not necessarily point to weakness.
"When you are good, you can also be strong."
"""Thank you very much for your advice and explanations"", said the villager, and said ""You explanation gave me the clarity"""
Now I became happy.
"We can see from the above story that, village man who understood the secret of happiness was not only happy but people around him were also happy."
"Long ago, there lived a great scholar and astrologer by the name Pani, on the banks of the river Indus."
"By the grace of Lord Shiva, Pani's wife delivered a healthy son."
The son came to be known as Panini.
The little boy was very active and his smile reminded one of the full moon..
"One day, a friend, scholar, and palmist visited Pani."
He was served the best food and was treated with the best services.
"After lunch, the great man called the child Panini and asked him to sit with him."
Panini readily agreed and sat happily with the great man.
He looked at the right palm of the child.
Because he has no education line on his palm
Pani asked - but would it be possible that you haven't checked my son's palm correctly?
I have checked the boy's palm thoroughly
What are Yama and Niyama?
Which are the three Yama’s explained in this lesson?
Which are the three Niyama’s explained in this lesson?
Why Panini made a cut on his hand?
Why river goddess returned all axes to the wood cutter?
You are the future of our Nation.
"You are expected to be energetic, physically fit."
And also be mentally fit.
This is possible through active participation in sports.
Such activities make the mind sharp and active
and help in increasing the level of awareness besides promoting creatitivity.
Sports activities should be part of your daily routine.
The importance of sports and games should be promoted everywhere.
In this lesson you will learn about some Yogic games.
"It help you to develop the abilities of awareness, concentration and attention."
"Given in this lesson are some Yogic games to help develop awareness, speed."
"These will help you to naturally improve your memory, IQ and creativity also."
"After reading this lesson, you will be able to: Undertake Yogic Games."
"Develop the abilities of awareness, concentration and attention."
They learn by experiencing the results of their actions.
Their actions depends on their experiences.
playing games has a number of advantages.
Such teaching learning methods help promote attention-focusing quality.
Games help the learner to focus attention more effectively than any other teaching tools.
This method is also used as a way to teach and learn in the early years.
The learning through play helps in the mastery of social skills of becoming a team player.
This is basically a game for teaching to be focussed.
The players will stand with their hands on the waist in a straight line or in a circle.
The organiser/teacher will arrange chairs in a line.
The number of chairs lined up will be 1-2 less than the number of children participating in the game.
The teacher will either blow a whistle continuously or arrange for some music to be played.
"When the teacher stops playing the musical instrument, all the players must run to sit on the chairs lined up."
The player who does not manage to sit on the chair will be out.
The teacher then keeps removing a few chairs after each round till finally the winner is found.
This is basically a game of alertness and being focussed.
"Each participant will try to keep his right hand on another's head as the Bhasmasura did and say ""Bhasma"", (Ash)."
At the same time the playere should stop others from keeping their hands on his head.
For this they use their left hand.
They can protect their head by keeping their left hand just above their head but not touching it.
One whose head is touched by another's hand is deemed out.
The game continues till the winner is found.
This is basically an awareness and number game.
The children sit in a circle and the teacher calls out some numbers.
"Whenever 3 and its multiples are called, the players will say ‘HARI’and wherever 5 and its multiples are called the players will say‘OM’."
"Wherever multiples of 3 and 5 are called together, the players will say “hari –om”."
The player who repeats the actual number called out instead of ‘Hari’ ‘om’ will be out.
All the players stand in straight line as shown in the figure.
"A player will be selected and he/she will stand 2 feet awa,"
in front of them facing the same direction as of those in line behind.
A line is drawn behind the line of the players at distance of about 20 feet.
The player selected will tell an interesting story to the players.
In between suddenly he/she will shout ‘Bomb Blast’.
Immediately all players standing in the line run back to reach the drawn line 20 feet away.
"If the player catches any player before they reach the line, he/ she is out."
The game continues with the new player.
All the participants sit in a circle.
A small parcel or a ball is passed from one player to the other player.
"When instructor whistles continuously, but stops suddenly, At that particular moment the one who holds the ball is the victim of bomb blast."
He/she then come to the centre where some chits will be kept in a pot with actions to be performed.
The players picks the chit and has to perform the action written on the chit.
"The actions could be dancing, mono-act, mimicry, shouting, songs, bhajans etc., "
the game continues till all have had a chance to do something.
This game is basically played to develop attentiveness.
"The children are seated in circle, "
and one player is selected to move around the circle with a handkerchief.
X' with a kerchief in hand runs around the circle dropping it behind 'Y’
Kerchief was dropped so carefully that 'Y' is not aware of it.
"If 'Y' is not yet aware of the kerchief, then 'X' after completing his round comes and punches on Y's back till'Y' picks up the kerchief"
now 'X' will occupy Y's place.
"If 'Y' comes to know about the placing of the kerchief before hand, "
he picks up the kerchief and chases 'X'
"If 'Y' touches 'X' before he completes the round, then 'X' has to run again with the kerchief."
Like this 'X' has to drop the kerchief at the back of some other player.
"If 'Y' does not succeed in touching'X’, then 'X' will occupy Y's place"
and 'Y’ will run and game continues as above.
A player will be selected and he/she has to assume the posture of a frog and start chasing the other players.
"In a given time, whomever the frog touches, that player is called out and he/she then has to assume the role of a “Frog”, and the game continues."
The player who doesn't manage to sit on the chair will be out.
Each player will try to keep his right hand on another players head and say Bhasma.
A line is drawn twenty feet behind the line of players.
"In a given time, the player acting as a Frog has to catch another player who then becomes the frog."
Education is incomplete without sports and games.
"In this lesson you have learnt some yogic games which are very useful in teaching us punctuality, responsibility, patience, and discipline"
It will make dedicated towards our goal.
Each game has a particular quality.
"It promotes harmony, group dynamics, peace and bliss."

Learn by heart and recite the poem taught in the class.
Yoga is a mastery over the mind.There are various streams of Yoga.
 Swami Vivekananda broadly categorized this into four streams as they are:
Karma Yoga  -    this  is  about  selfless  action  without  an attachment to the results.
Raja Yoga - this is the practical approach to reach higher states of consciousness.
Bhakti Yoga - this is an attitude of total surrender and love.
Jnana Yoga - this is the path of knowledge. It deals with the intellect.
"Swami Vivekananda said, “All streams of Yoga lead to the same goal.  "
"Do  it  by  work  (Karma Yoga),  worship  (Bhakti Yoga), philosophy (Jyana Yoga) or psychic control (Raja Yoga) by any one or two or all of these and be free”."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able"
"recall four streams of Yoga- Karma Yoga, Raja Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Jnana Yoga and"
"practice  Karma Yoga,  Raja Yoga,  Bhakti Yoga  and  Jnana Yoga."
Karma means any action which is physical or mental.
"Karma yoga is welfare activity, performed selflessly, unattached and silently. "
"Karma yoga is also an art of ‘working in relaxation’ with total ‘ Awareness ’. Our actions are classified into three, namely Tamas, Rajas and Sattva."
Tamas-This is the darkness and the crudeness in man. 
It is born  of  ignorance  and  the  cause  of  delusion. 
" It  binds  us through recklessness, laziness and sleep."
Rajas -This is full of passion and is born out intense desire and attachment.
 It binds the usthrough attachment with action.
"Sattva -This is pure, without impurities, illuminating and free from sickness. "
It binds usthrough attachment with happiness and knowledge.
Karma Yoga offers us three methods towards achieving the goal.
"First step: This is to destroy the Tamas and remove the resistance to action, both physical and mental."
"Second step:This is to overcome the problems of Rajas, manage the most difficult situations as fire-fighting with ease and not get lost."
Third step:This is to resolve all conflicts that arise on our way towards achieving the goal.
Let us now learn and understand one of the famous sloka from Bhagavad Gita which explains the Karma yoga:
"You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions."
" Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction. BG 2.47"
"This is a very popular verse of the Bhagavad Gita, so much so that even most school children in India are familiar with it."
 It offers deep insight into the proper spirit of work and is often quoted whenever the topic of Karma yoga is discussed.
 This verse gives four instructions regarding the Karma yoga
"Do your duty, but do not worry yourself with the results."
The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment.
"Even while working, give up the pride of doership."
Do your work in regulated and disciplined manner.
Raja means King. Raja yoga is the path of discipline and practice with will power.
  The main texts of this tradition are yoga sutra of Maharshi Patanjali. It is also known as Ashtanga Yoga (The eight-step yoga) because it is organized into eight parts:
Yama – Self control
Niyama - Discipline
Asana - Physical exercises
Pranayama  -  Breathing exercises
Pratyahara - Removal of the senses from external objects
Dharana - Concentration
Dhyana - Meditation
Samadhi - Complete realization
Raja yoga is also defined as the path of willpower.
 Lord Krishna explains this aspect  in Bhagavad Githa:
"Elevate  yourself  through  the  power  of  your  mind,  and  not degrade yourself, for the mind can be the friend and also the enemy of the self. BG 6.5"
Lord Krishna says that we must use the mind to elevate the self.
"In other words, we must use the intellect to control the mind. "
"In today’s time if we are suffering from various problems, suffering from  ill  health,  tensions  and  stresses,  these  are  of  our  own making. "
"Therefore, it is for us to change ourselves to overcome these miseries and grow to reach higher states of bliss, creativity and freedom."
Swami Vivekananda says that “We are the makers of our own destiny”.
 We have been given the freedom to choose either to make or damage ourselves.
" If we use this freedom of will, the power of intelligence and discrimination for development, we ‘make’ ourselves. And if we misuse, there is decline and we ‘damage’ ourselves."
"We  all  possess  that  “will”  power  as  a  manifestation  of  that freedom is in ourselves. Thus, Raja Yoga is to use that will power and elevate ourselves."
1. Karma means any action which is…………. or…………. .
"2. Our actions are classified into……… , ……… and……. ."
3. Raja Yoga is also known as…………….
"The term Bhakti comes from the root 'Bhaj', which means 'to be attached to God'."
 Bhakti yoga is a devotion and it is focused on the cultivation of love and devotion towards the God. 
" The origin of  Bhakti  can  be  seen  in  the  Upanishads,  specifically  the Shvetashvatara Upanishad. "
" The Bhagavad Gita, The Puranas and Narada Bhakti Sutra are important scriptures that explain the philosophy of Bhakti yoga."
Lord Krishna explains the quality of Bhakta in Bhagavad Gith that:
"Those  devotees  are  very  dear  to  me  who  are  free  from  hatred toward all living beings, who are friendly, and compassionate. They are free from attachment to possessions and egotism, equipoised in happiness and distress, and ever-forgiving. BG 12.13"
"Bhakti softens the heart and removes jealousy, hatred, lust, anger, egoism, pride and arrogance."
"Bhakti infuses joy, divine ecstasy, bliss, peace and knowledge."
"All  cares,  worries  and  anxieties,  fears,  mental  torments  and tribulations entirely vanish."
Bhavas or feelings are natural to human beings and so these are easy to practice.
 There are five kinds of bhava in Bhakti.
Shanta  Bhava:  The  devotee  is shanta  or  peaceful. 
 He  does  no jump  and  dance. 
 Bhishma  was  a Shanta Bhakta.
"DasyaBhava:  It  is  about  being  a servant of god. Lord Hanuman was a  Dasya  Bhakta.  He  had  Dasya Bhava, servant attitude."
"SakhyaBhava:  God  is  a  friend  of the devotee. Arjuna had this Bhava towards Lord Krishna. They both used to sit, eat, talk and walk together as close friends."
"Vatsalya Bhava: The devotee looks upon God as his child. Yashoda  had  this  Bhava  with  Lord  Krishna.  The  devotee serves, feeds, and looks upon God as a mother does in the case of her child."
Madhurya Bhava: This is the highest form of Bhakti. The devotee respects the Lord as his lover. This was the relation between Radha and Krishna. The devotee and God feel one with each other and still maintain a separateness in order to enjoy the bliss of the play of love between them.
"Navavidha Bhakti: The nine forms of devotion are Shravanam – Hearing the names, stories and glories of the God Keertanam – Chanting his glories Smaranam – Remembering the God"
• Paada sevanam – Serving the God’s feet
• Archanam – Worshiping the God
• Vandanam – Offering obeisance unto the God
• Daasyam – Serving the God as his servant
• Sakhyam – Developing friendship with the God
• Aatma Nivedanam – Total surrender of oneself to the God
Bhakti is bliss and more blissful would be our lives when we cultivate and practice the above discussed Navavidha Bhakti or nine  forms  of  devotion  in  our  journey  of  life  towards  theSupreme.
Jnana means knowledge or wisdom. Jnana yoga is the path of intellect and the path of analysis. This is also the yoga of wisdom and has its own methodology.
The fundamental goal of Jnana yoga is to become liberated from ignorance and to achieve the true knowledge or wisdom.
Lord Krishna say’s in Bhagavad Gith that:
Even those who are considered the most immoral of all sinners can cross over this ocean of material existence by seating themselves in the boat of divine knowledge.BG 4.36
The three methodology of Jnana Yoga are:
Shravana: It means hearing. Hearing a lecture or reading a book or watching a video all come under Shravana.
"Manana: After  hearing  a lecture,  you  must  start cognizing  about  it,  then logically try to understand it,  repeat  that  again  and again, questioning it to themaximum possible extent which is  called Manana."
Nididhyasana: It means experiment.
Experiencing true knowledge through Jnana yoga allows the student to know God and  be liberated.
"In this unit you have understood the four paths of yoga, namely Karma Yoga, Raja Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Jnana Yoga. "
You also learned the methods and steps of these Yoga.

Hatha yoga is an ancient spiritual yogic practice.
" The word 'Hatha' is composed of two syllables 'Ha' and 'Tha' which denote the 'Pingala' and the 'Ida', the vital and the mental, the solar and the lunar energies in the human system."
"Classical Hatha yoga has five limbs, which are;"
" Asana: This is the physical postures. It is to gain steadiness of body and mind, freedom from disease and the lightness of limbs."

" explain the importance of Hatha yoga in physical, mental, social and emotional level and practice Hatha yoga in correct posture."
IMPORTANT TEXTS OF HATHA YOGA
"Hatha Yoga starts from the Annamaya Kosha (physical level), which helps to create a balance between the mind and body."
"Although Hatha yoga begins with the Annamaya Kosha, if performed correctly, the practices of Hatha yoga impact the subtler Pranamaya (Vital force), Manomaya (Mental) and Vijnanamaya (Intellectual) Koshas  as well."
" As one practices Hatha yoga techniques, one's physical and mental potential begin to increase and unfold. "
 Many yogis have written the Hatha yoga texts.
Hatha yoga practices start from following:
Proper Diet- The Hatha yoga texts emphasize on moderate eating or consuming a measured diet. 
Hatha yoga pradipika suggests that One's eating habits should not be driven by cravings.
"A proper diet is one which is tasty, likable and nutritious."
The diet should be able to fulfill all the required nutritional needs of the body entirely.
It also suggests that one should eat only when hungry and not otherwise.
Proper Body Cleansing- Hatha yoga suggests a list of cleansing techniques known as shat-karma
Dhauti- Cleanse teeth and body
Neti- Cleanse nasal passages
Basti-Cleanse bladder
Trataka- Cleanse eyes
Kapalabhati-Cleanse phlegm
Nauli-Abdominal massage 
Proper Postures- Asanas are specialized postures of the body often imitating many of the animal postures. 
Large number of Asanas exists.
"The main four Asanas are: Padmasana, Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Vajrasana"
Proper Breathing- Pranayama is a breathing technique.
This practice will consciously regulate our breath combined with focused muscles exercises. 
There are several ways in which one can regulate the breathing.
" The following are the few examples of Pranayama: Nadishuddhe, Bhramari, Shitali, Ujjayi Mudra's and Vital Energies- Mudra's or hand gestures are important while performing meditation as these are vital to reach out as well as manipulate the dormant vital energies in the body."
Hatha Yoga Pradipika: The author of this text is Nath Yogi Swatmarama.
Gheranda Samhitha: This text is a conversation between Rishi Gheranda and King Chandakapali.
Hatha Ratnavali:This is an important treatise on Hatha yoga and Tantra written by Srinivasa Bhatta Mahayogendra.

Gorakshasatkam: This was written by Guru Goraknath.
Yoga Rahasya: This was written byNathamuni.
Siddhasidhant Paddhati:This was written by Guru Gorakhnath.
I. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RAJA YOGA AND HATHA YOGA
Hatha Yoga is the physical practice of yoga which focuses first on the Kriya and Asana practice. 
Hatha yoga is part of the integral system of Raja Yoga and focuses on the subtle energy flow in the body known as Prana.
Hatha Yoga is the ladder leading to Raja Yoga. 
We can find the reference of this in Hatha Yoga Pradipika.
"Prostrating first to the guru, Yogi Swatmarama instructs the knowledge of Hatha yoga only for the Raja Yoga (the highest state of yoga)."
Raja yoga is the royal path of yoga consisting of eight steps.
" The first steps, Yama and Niyama, are the moral foundations for the yoga practice followed by Asana, Pranayama, sense withdrawal, concentration, and culminating with meditation and Samadhi."
 Raja yoga is about controlling the mind and thought waves in the mind.
Hatha yoga suggests a list of cleansing techniques known as ………..
Yoga Rahasya was written by…………...
………………is a breathing technique.
WHAT ARE BANDHAS AND MUDRAS?
"Bandha Bandha means to lock, close-off, to stop."
" In the practice of a Bandha, the energy flow to a particular area of the body is blocked. "
"When the Bandha is released, this causes the energy to flood more strongly through the body with an increased pressure."
There are four types of Bandhas:
Mula Bandha - Anal Lock
Uddiyana Bandha - Lifting of the Diaphragm
Jalandhara Bandha - Chin Lock
Maha Bandha - Practice of all three Bandhas at the same time.
Mudra means a 'sign' or a 'seal' in sanskrit.
" The word mudra has a number of different meanings in yoga which include meditation practices. Here, 'Mud' means 'to delight' or 'to be happy' and 'Ra' means 'to give'. "
An action that gives us delight or extreme joy.
Mudra's are most commonly associated with various hand gestures.
"The fingers are related to different types of energies and when they are brought together in specific ways, they produce subtle effects."
The Basics of Mudra's
Thumb-The fire (Agni)
Index finger-The air (Vayu)
Middle finger-The ether (Aakasha)
Ring finger-The earth (Prithvi)
"Small finger-The water (Jala) so as to bring back the balance in the five elements, there are some specific methods of touching and aligning the fingers with each other."
"The following are the few examples of Mudra: Chin Mudra, Chinmaya Mudra, Adi Mudra, Bramha Mudra"

.  VIBHUTI  PADA
Dharana is holding the mind on to some particular object.
An unbroken flow of knowledge to that object is Dhyana.
"When that, giving up all forms, reflects only themeaning, it is Samadhi."
(These)  three  (when  practised)  in  regard  to  one  object  is Samyama.
By the conquest of that comes light of knowledge.
That should be employed in stages.
These three are nearer than those that precede.
But even they are external to the seedless (Samadhi).
"By the suppression of the disturbed modifications of the mind, and by the rise of modifications of control,the mind is said to attain  the  controllingmodifications  -  followinghe  controlling powers ofthe mind."
Its flow becomes steady by habit.
"Taking in all sorts of objects and concentrating uponone object, these two powers being destroyed andmanifested respectively, the Chitta gets the modificationcalled Samadhi."
"The one-pointedness of the Chitta is when it grasps in one, the past and present."
"By this is explained the threefold transformations ofform, time and state, in fine or gross matter, and in theorgans."
"That which is acted upon by transformations, eitherpast, present or yet to be manifested, is the qualified."
The succession of changes is the cause of manifold evolution.
By making Samyama on the three sorts of changescomes the knowledge of past and future.
"By making Samyama on word, meaning, andknowledge, which are  ordinarily  confused,  comes  theknowledge  of  all  animal sounds."
"By perceiving the impressions, knowledge of pastlife."
By making Samyama on the signs in another's bothknowledge of that mind comes.
"But not its contents, that not being the object of theSamyama."
"By  making  Samyama  on  the  form  of  the  body  thepower  of perceiving forms being obstructed, thepower of manifestation in the eye being separated, theYogi's body becomes unseen."
By this the disappearance or concealment of wordswhich are being spoken is also explained.
"By making Samyama on friendship, etc., variousstrength comes."
"By making Samyama on that effulgent light comesthe knowledge of the fine, the obstructed, and theremote."
"By making Samyama on the sun, (comes) the knowledge of the world."
"On the moon, (comes) the knowledge of the cluster ofstars."
On the pole star (comes) the knowledge of themotions of the stars.
On the navel circle (comes) the knowledge of theconstitution of the body.
On the hollow of the throat (comes) cessation ofhunger.
On the nerve called Kurma (comes) fixity of thebody.
On  the  light  emanating  from  the  top  of  the  head  sightof  the Siddhas.
Or by the power of Pratibha all knowledge.
"In the heart, knowledge of minds."
Enjoyment comes by the non-discrimination of thevery distant soul and Sattva.
"From  that  arises  the  knowledge  of  hearing,  touching,seeing, tasting, and smelling, belonging to Pratibha."
These are obstacles to Samadhi; but they are powers in the worldly state.
"When the cause of bondage has become loosened, theYogi, by his  knowledge  of  manifestation  through  theorgans,  enters another's body."
"By conquering the current called Udana the Yogidoes not sink in water, or in swamps, and he can walkon thorns."
By the conquest of the current Samana he issurrounded by blaze.
By making Samyama on the relation between the ear and the Akasa comes divine hearing.
By making Samyama on the relation between theAkasa and the body the Yogi becoming light as cottonwool goes through the skies.
"By making Samyama on the real modifications of themind, which are outside, called great disembodiness,comes disappearance of the covering to light."
"By making Samyama on the elements, beginning withthe gross, and ending with the superfine, comesmastery of the elements."
"From  that  comes  minuteness,  and  the  rest  of  the  powers, ""glorification of the body,"" andindestructibleness of the bodily qualities."
"The glorifications of the body are beauty, complexion, strength, adamantine hardness."
"By making Samyama on the objectivity, knowledge and egoism of the organs, by gradation comes theconquest of the organs."
"From that comes glorified mind, power of the organsindependently of the body, and conquest of nature."
"By making Samyama on the Sattva, to him who hasdiscriminated between the intellect and the Purusacomes omnipresence and omniscience."
By giving up even these comes the destruction of the very seed of evil; he attains Kaivalya.
"The Yogi should not feel allured or flattered by theovertures of celestial beings, for fear of evil again."
By making Samyama on a particle of time and its multiples comes discrimination.
"Those which cannot be differentiated by species, signand place, even they will be discriminated by theabove Samyama."
"The saving knowledge is that knowledge ofdiscrimination which covers all objects, all means."
By  the  similarity  of  purity  between  the  Sattva  and  thePurusa comes Kaivalya.
"Maharshi Patanj\ali was a great sage who had compiled all the 195  Yoga Sutras at Rudraprayag,  a  hilly  district  in Uttrakhand,   1700 years ago."
It is believed that Maharishi Patanjali was the avatar or incarnation of AdiShesha (The Serpent upon whom Lord Vishnu rests).
"His compilation, Yoga Sutra, is a universal textbook of Yoga, which is taught in all the schools of Yoga worldwide."
"It has a four chapters, namely;  . Samadhi  Pada  . SadanaPada  . VibhuthiPada  . KaivalyaPada This Yoga Sutra's are also called as Raja Yoga."
"Patanjali also wrote the commentary on Panini's Ashtadhyayi (Grammar). He is also the writer of a work on the ancient Indian medicine system, Ayurveda."
. Yoga Sutra's are written by………………...
. An  unbroken  flow  of  knowledge  to  that  object  is….......... (Sutra  . )
. The succession of changes is the cause of manifold……... (Sutra  .  )
. The glorifications of the body are…….;……..;…..and………. (Sutra  .  )
.  KAIVALYA  PADA
"The Siddhis (powers) are attained by birth, chemicalmeans, power of words, mortification or concentration."
"The change into another species is by the filling in of nature. Good deeds, etc., are not the direct causes in thetransformation of nature, but they act as breakers ofobstacles to the evolutions of nature, as a farmer breaks the obstacles to the course of water, whichthen runs down by its own nature."
"Though the activities of the different created minds are various, the one original mind is the controller ofthem all."
"Works are neither black nor white for the Yogis; forothers they are threefold, black, white, and mixed."
From these threefold works are manifested in eachstate only those desires fitting to that statealone.
"(The others are held in abeyance for the timebeing.) There  is  connectiveness  in  desire,  even  thoughseparated  by speices, space and time, there beingidentifi-cation of memory and impressions."
"Thirst for happiness being eternal, desires are withoutbeginning. Being held together by cause, effect, support, andobjects, in the absence of these is its absence."
"The past and future exist in their own nature, qualitieshaving different ways. They are manifested or fine, being of the nature of theGunas."
"The  object  ofperception  is  not  dependent  on  the  chitta;  what would happen to the object of perception when the medium of cognition is not there? Things are known or unknown to the mind, beingde-pendent on the colouring which they give to themind."
"The states of the mind are always known because thelord of the mind is unchangeable. Mind is not self-luminous, being an object."
From its being unable to cognise two things at the same time. Another cognising mind being assumed there will beno end to such assumptions and confusion ofmemory.
"The  essence  of  knowledge  (the  Purusa)  beingun-changeable, when the mind takes its form, itbecomes conscious."
For the discriminating the perception of the mind asAtman ceases. Then bent on discriminating the mind attains theprevious state of Kaivalya (isolation).
"The resolution in the inverse order of the qualities,berfect of any motive  of  action  for  the  Purusa,  isKaivalya,  or  it  is  the establishment of the power ofknowledge in its own nature."

"After studying this lesson, you will be able to:"
"learn Yogic games which will help the children to develop their awareness, concentration and attention abilities and   develop speed, creativity and group co-ordination that will improve memory, IQ and creativity skills."
"Children do not learn by being taught, but learn by experiencing the results of their actions."
"It has been found that learning through playing games has a number of necessary qualities, one of these being  their  attention-focusing  quality."
Games  tend  to  focus attention more effectively than most other teaching devices.
It is also used as a way to learn Social skills and Group awareness.
"Play and fun is the foundation of education. The best knowledge of life we learn, through play."
Awareness allows you to become positive rather than reactive but you need to be specific.
It's very easy to improve and can be started immediately.
"Open up your senses and become a sponge, soaking up all the information you can."
"Speak  and  more  importantly  listen  to  your  team  mates, coaches to get an understanding of who they are."

II. PATANJALI YOGA PRACTICE
The instructor stands in the center or in front of the group and gives orders.
"Only those orders given in the name of 'PATANJALI' should be obeyed, i.e. if instructor says sit, the group should not sit but if instructor says 'PATANJALI says sit' then all players should sit."
Those who do not follow the order will be 'out'. The last left out player who obeyed the order correctly will be the winner.
"(i) Variation  : In this game, all the instructions for right side action to be ignored."
"(ii)  Variation  : In this game, action opposite to what is told is to be performed."
"If the instructor says, turn right, all participants must turn left."
"If he says stop, the group should continue walk and so on."
"To play musical chairs, you need to have chairs or seats set up in a circle."
You should start with one less chair than the amount of players playing.
"So for example, if there are   people playing, you should have   chairs in a circle."
Set up the chairs with the seat of the chair facing the outside of the circle.
"If you don't have chairs, you can use carpet squares, or pillows instead."
"As  soon  as  the  music  starts  playing,  the  players  walk  in a  circle  around  the  chairs."
"You  can  choose  whether to  go  clockwise  or  counter-clock-wise,  but  all  players should go the same direction following the person in front of them."
"After some time, the teacher, or host should stop the music."
"When the music stops, each player needs to find a chair to sit down in."
There will be one player left without a chair to sit in because there is one less chair than players.
The  player  that  didn't  find  a  chair  to  sit  it  is  out  of  the game.
"After the person who didn't find a chair leaves the game, you need to remove one chair to play another round."
Start another round by playing the music and having the players walk around the chairs again.
The last round will be   players and one chair.
The player who sits in the chair this round is the winner.
It is important to note that:
It is a game that needs a lot of space in order to play it.
Make sure you have a wide open space in a room or outside to easily play the game.
IV. HARIOM This is basically an awareness and number game.

V. BHASMASURAH The story of Bhasmasurah:
Bhasmasura was a very powerful asura (demon).
"He was very big and strong but at the same time, he was also very foolish."
"Bhasmasura prayed to Shiva. Pleased with his devotion, Shiva decided to grant him a boon."
"When Shiva asked, Bhasmasura said,  ""Lord, please grant me the wish that whichever person, place or thing I place my right hand on, is reduced to ashes."
" Lord  Shiva  granted  him  the  boon  and  Bhasmasura  was  very happy.  Having got the boon, the wicked Bhasmsura tried the boon on Shiva himself. As  a  result,  Shiva  started  running from  Bhasmasura  to  save  himself. Seeing  Shiva's  plight,  Lord  Vishnu decided  to  help  him.  He  changed himself  into  a  beautiful  young maiden,  called  Mohini,  instead. He was attacked by Mohini's beauty and asked  her  to  marry  him. Mohini agreed to marry him, but she had a condition. She asked Bhasmasura to touch his head and promise her that he  would  not  marry  again  if  she became  his  wife.  Bhasmasura  agreed. As  soon  as  the  foolish demon touched his head, he was reduced to ashes. That is how Vishnu succeeded in saving Shiva from Bhasmasura.     Each participant will try to keep his right hand on another's head as the Bhasmasura did and say Bhasma"", (Ash)."
VI. RAM-SHYAM It is concentration or awareness game.

Dexterity games are a particular form of physical games where speed control is more important than physical attributes such as strength or endurance.
"There  is  a  pleasure  in  dexterity  where  the  complexity  of  the movement becomes second nature to the point where the person responds  without  having  to  think  about  how  they  move themselves, much as a driver does not think about where to move their hands or feet."

"Singing devotional songs, patriotic songs and inspirational songs increase one's devotion towards God and the Nation, helps in enhancing our pride for the Nation and Dharma and also increases our purity."
The word 'Vande Mataram' was the national call for Freedom in India.
These two words were always recited by many freedom fighters of India when they were hanged by the Britishers.
". Thus, the song 'Vande Mataram' reminds us of their sacrifice."
"It was written  by  legendary  Bengali  writer  and  novelist,  Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and selected as the National Song of India on 24 January 1950 "
"As this song is in the Divine language, Sanskrit, the one singing it as well as the one listening to it, is benefited."
Children should memorize this song in full and learn to sing it in tune.

"We all have Ego and we get angry over small, simple and silly matters which not only harm the self physically and emotionally but also pollute the whole atmosphere of the class room and home besides irreparable loss in cordial relationship."
Ego  is a feeling of pride in your superiority to others and self- importance.
"While playing with children, having fun, feeling of pride leads to road rage, tantrums and outbursts are all part of the high-emotions in this mindset."

"Blessings of our parents, well-wishes of far relatives,  love of elders etc are there with you all the time."
Do you agree?  Can you observe them alike any other source of energy?  You may not.
Because of their  invisible  form  and  not  observed  through  senses  or inference.
"Similarly, we receive energy from the universe."
The Sun is the most celebrated source of energy in the Vedas and in many traditions of the world.
The Sun is the center and source of the living and non-living universe.
Can we  give light and heat to the Sun?
Will we  return oxygen to the plants?
Will we  give pure water back to the rivers?
Will we give soothing breeze to the nature outside?   It’s impossible. 
Indian traditional system has some unique ways of giving back to the source and thanking the giver of energy.
Elders say that if you want to return anything to the nature keep in the mind
Do not waste
Do not pollute
Use only when it is needed
Give the recourses to the needy
Increase the quality of the source
This is the way to give back to the nature.

Recite the mantras of Bhagya Suktam
Explain in short the relevance of Bhagya Suktam
The entire world is made up of three aspects;
" Sattva, Rajas and Tamas."
These in their original form are invisible.
They are not seen by your eyes. You cannot touch them.
one  cannot taste Guna like salt.
you've seen  different t.v channels   making documentaries of different things the vast universe.
The spend lot of time lot of energy to follow animals birds plants insects at cetera.  Sometimes it takes more than a decade to document the life journey of of small insect. 
 Day and night without blinking their eyes with very sophisticated cameras the scientist wait to observe a creature.
This kind of passion is needed to know even three Gunas.
"Alike human beings, plants also have lives."
"As you know the life in the plants is inferred through different activities such as growth, movement, reproduction and breathing, similarly you have to infer these Gunas through continuous self-observation."
To know the vastness and all pervasive nature of Trigunas you should grow in life.
"But, even now you can see and observe about which of three gunas is predominant in you"
"Geeta is one such book which tells about three gunas in detail it says about how three Trigunas have influence on our thinking, sleeping, eating, behaving etc."
In fact there is nothing in the world which is not influenced by Gunas because everything is made up of Gunas only.
recite the shlokas from 14th chapter of Bhagavad Gita;
know the concept of Gunas in brief.
"I will again declare (to thee) that supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, having known which all the sages have gone to the supreme perfection after this life."
"They who, having taken refuge in this knowledge, attain to unity with Me, are neither born at the time of creation nor are they disturbed at the time of dissolution."
"My womb is the great Brahma; in that I place the germ; thence, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings!"
"Whatever forms are produced, O Arjuna, in any womb whatsoever, the great Brahma is their womb and I am the seed-giving father."
"Of these, Sattwa, which from its stainlessness is luminous and healthy, binds by attachment to knowledge and to happiness, O sinless one!"
"Know thou Rajas to be of the nature of passion, the source of thirst (for sensual enjoyment) and attachment; it binds fast, O Arjuna, the embodied one by attachment to action!"
"But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all  embodied  beings;  it  binds  fast,  O  Arjuna,  by heedlessness, sleep and indolence!"
"Sattwa attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while  Tamas,  shrouding  knowledge,  attaches  to heedlessness only!"
"Now Sattwa prevails, O Arjuna, having overpowered Rajas and Tamas; now Rajas, having overpowered Sattwa and Tamas; and now Tamas, having overpowered Sattwa and Rajas!"
"When,  through  every  gate  (sense)  in  this  body,  the wisdom-light shines, then it may be known that Sattwa is predominant."
"Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, longing—these  arise  when  Rajas  is  predominant,  O Arjuna!"
"Darkness, inertness, heedlessness and delusion—these arise when Tamas is predominant, O Arjuna!"
"If the embodied one meets with death when Sattwa has become predominant, then he attains to the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest."
"Meeting death in Rajas, he is born among those who are attached to action; and dying in Tamas, he is born in the womb of the senseless."
"The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattwic and pure; the fruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas."
"From Sattwa arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness  and  delusion  arise  from  Tamas,  and ignorance also."
"Those who are seated in Sattwa proceed upwards; the Rajasic dwell in the middle; and the Tamasic, abiding in the function of the lowest Guna, go downwards."
"When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas, knowing that which is higher than them, he attains to My Being."
"The embodied one, having crossed beyond these three Gunas out of which the body is evolved, is freed from birth,  death,  decay  and  pain,  and  attains  to immortality."
"What are the marks of him who has crossed over the three qualities, O Lord What is his conduct and how does he go beyond these three qualities."
"Alike in pleasure and pain, who dwells in the Self, to whom a clod of earth, stone and gold are alike, to whom the dear and the unfriendly are alike, firm, the same in censure and praise."
"The same in honour and dishonour, the same to friend and foe, abandoning all undertakings—he is said to have crossed the qualities."
"And he who serves Me with unswerving devotion, he, crossing  beyond  the  qualities,  is  fit  for  becoming brahman  ."
"Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the  science  of  the  Eternal,  the  scripture  of Yoga,  the dialogue  between  Sri  Krishna  and Arjuna,  ends  the fourteenth discourse entitled:"
“The Yoga of the Division of the Three Gunas”
"Three types of Gunas. satv, rajas, tamas"
Three types of  nature.
Essence of 14th chapter of bhagvad Geeta.
Describe three Gunas in detail.
Write the summary of 14th chapter of Bhagvad Geeta.
"When you were an infant, your father was everything for you."
"He provides anything you need,  he protects the family, he gives  you  emotional  support  almost  he  is  like  an all-rounder for you."
"Similarly, you mother; she makes it possible to get what you want, almost all the works of your house are done by her, basically she is the home maker, she cooks, cleans, manages, supports, mentors and what not? Don’t you think parents are everything for you."
"When you grow, capable of handling things yourself,  just your  parents  are  not  everything."
"You  can  see  teachers, managers, principals and village Panchayat officials etc. who are just more than capable than your parents.  However, there can be no one who cares you more than your parents or parent-like caring people, is it not?"
"It has thousands of limbs to act, eyes to watch, ears to hear etc."
This is the whole message of this Purusha Sukta.
"Purusha Suktam colorfully narrates the properties, characteristics of Purusha (cosmic existance)."
The body of capable of doing everything is called Purusha  in  Vedas.
"There  are  many  Purushas  also,  Vastu Purusha, Rashtra Purusha, Yajna purusha, Samaja Pursha etc."
"recite all the mantras of Purusha sukta,"
understand the basics of Purusha suktam.
May the gods rain peace on us.
"May all the two-legged creatures be happy, and may all the four- legged creatures also be happy."
May there be peace in the hearts of all beings in all realms.
"The Purusha  has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes and a thousand feet."
He has enveloped this world from all sides and has (even) transcended it by ten angulas or inches.
All this is verily the Purusha.
All that which existed in the past or will come into being in the future.
"Also, he is the Lord of immortality. That which grows profusely by food (is also the Purusha)."
"So much is His greatness. However, the Purusha is greater than this."
All the beings form only a quarter (part of) Him.
From mahavishnu  was born the Virat 
he is the one Making  this Virat  as  the  substratum   purusha 
"As  soon  as  he  was  born,  he multiplied himself. Later, he created this earth and then, the bodies (of the living beings)."
"When the devas performed a yajna, using the Purusha as the havis for the yajna, the Vasanta became the ajya, the Grishma  served as idhma and  the sharad  filled the place of havis "
"The devas, the sadhyas and the rishis performed the sacrifice by using that Purusha as the means of yajna, the Purusha who had been born in the beginning, after sprinkling him with water by the barhis "
"From that yajna  wherein the Cosmic Being was Himself the oblation, was produced the prasajta "
"Birds flying in the air, wild animals of the forest as also the domesticated animals of the villages were also produced."
"From that yajna (or sacrifice) wherein the Cosmic Being was Himself the oblation, were born the riks (the mantras of the Rig-veda) and the samans (the mantras of the Sama-veda)."
From that (yajna) the metres (like Gayatri) were born. From that (yajna again) the yujas (the Yajur-veda) was born.
"From that were born the horses, as also animals (like donkeys and mules) which have two rows of teeth. From that were born the cattle."
From that (again) were born goats and sheep.
What became of his face or mouth? What became of his two arms?
What became of His two thighs? What were (the products of) the two feet called?
From His face (or the mouth) came the brahmanas.
From His two arms came the rajanya (the kshatriyas).
From His two thighs came the vaishyas. From His two feet came the shudras.
From His mind was born the moon.
From His two eyes was born the sun. From His mouth were born Indra and Agni.
From  (His)  navel  was  produced  the  antariksha  (the  space between the earth and the heavens).
Dyuloka (or heaven) came into existence from His head.
"The bhumi (the earth) evolved out of His feet, and deek (or spacial directions) from His ears."
Similarly (the demigods) produced the worlds (too).
"I know his great Purusha ,  the  wise  one,  who,  having  created  the various forms and the nomenclatures , deals with them by those names, and who is beyond darkness and is brilliant like the sun."
"In the ancient days, Prajapati (Brahma) praised Him."
Indra who knows all the four quarters also spoke about Him.
"Anyone who knows Him thus, will become immortal even in this life."
For attaining liberation there is no other path
The gods worshiped  yajna through yajna 
Those very processes became the primary dharmas.
Those great ones attain that heaven where the ancient devas (demigods) and sadhyas live.
Prajapati  (the  Supreme  Creator)  moves  inside  the  cosmic womb.
"(Though) unborn, He takes birth in a variety of ways."
The wise ones know His (real nature) as the origin (of the universe).
The creators  desire to attain the positions of Marichi and others.
"Obeisances to Him, the self-luminous Brahman, who shines for the (demi) gods, who is the leader of the rituals of the gods and who was born even before the gods."
"In the beginning of creation, the gods, manifesting the light of Brahman, addressed Brahman thus: ""That brahmana who realizes  (You)  thus,  all  the  gods  will  come  under  his control."""
"O Purusha! The goddesses Hri (modesty) and Sri (Lakshmi, wealth) are Your consorts."
Day and night are Your lateral limbs.
The stars are Your form.
We worship and pray to the Supreme Lord for the welfare of all beings.
May all miseries and shortcomings leave us forever so that we may always sing for the Lord during the holy fire ceremonies.
May all medicinal herbs grow in potency so that all diseases may be cured.
"May all the two-legged creatures be happy, and may all the four-legged creatures also be happy."
May there be peace in the hearts of all beings in all realms.

Meanwhile the war was over leading to death of all those male members in his family except the Pancha Pandavas and the unborn child of Abhimanyu.
Yudishtra  the  eldest  of  the  Pandavas  became  the  King  of Hasthinapura and whom else would he go for advise other than Bheeshma the great.
Anushasanika Parva is in the form of questions  and  answers  between Yudishtra  and  Bheeshma .
"To a question as to what is the best possible stotra, Bheeshma answers that it is the Vishnu Sahasra Nama and teaches it to Yudishtra."
"Though it describes one thousand aspects and praises of the ord,  it  is  not  simple  and  easy  to  understand."
"Many  great Acharyas lead by Sankara Bhagavat Pada,. But this again was done in Sanskrit. With the modern civilization several translations of this stotra is available in English and in almost all major languages of India."

By the recitation of what mantra is a person released from the bonds of repeated birth and death?
What are those mantras by reciting which a being becomes freed from the bonds of birth and death.
"Bhishma said:— A person who is always engaged in praising with the hymn of a Thousand Names; the Lord of the Universe, the God of gods, and the limitless Supreme Being, And engaged in worshipping Him with devotion, meditating upon Him, glorifying Him, offering obeisance and adoring Him."
"one who is ever engaged in praising the Lord who is without beginning and end, the Allpervading-One, the Ruler of the Universe, the Supervisor of the worlds, the One Who is to be known from the Vedas, Who is Himself the Knower of all Dharmas, the One Who is constantly engaged in the Universal Welfare, Lord of the Universe, and the Cause of all beings such a devotee transcends over all the sorrows of this material world."
"This worship of the Supreme Lotus-eyed Lord at all times by a person endowed with devotion is regarded by me as the greatest of all religious practices He  Who  is  the  Supreme  Effulgence;  Who  is  the  Supreme Director;  Who  is  the  Supreme  Brahman;  and  Who  is  the Supreme, Highest and Ultimate Goal; He Who is the purest of the pure and the most auspicious amongst the auspicious, The God of gods and the indestructible Progenitor of all beings."

Observe the soil and keep in mind your soil is like a sponge. 
"Most houseplants like porous soil, which allows room for water and air pockets. "
"If your soil is moist, to begin with, hold off on watering for now. "
"If you notice water pours out through the drainage holes immediately, your soil is actually bone dry and the soil is repelling water, rather than soaking it in. "
Avoid pouring water onto bone dry soil. 
Water will only move through and  around  the  edges  of  your  planter  and  will  not  be absorbed by the roots. 
"Your plant should absorb water slowly through its roots so, before you water again, you'll want to check how dry the soil is. "
Use your fingers and feel if the soil is wet at least 2 inches below the surface. 
"If so, you can add water. "
"If your soil is wet at the surface, you can hold off. "
Proper availability of air is also important for the growth of Plants.

 It  is  also  essential  for making food through photosynthesis. 
The ancient texts also reflect the  importance  of  watering  plants. 
 It  has  been  written  in Vedas and other old scripts that watering plant is one of the sacred things. 
That's why giving water to Tulsi Plants is done by many people.

"However, they require it in different quantity. "
"The quality also differ in different reasons for example, plants needs more water in summers as waters get easily evaporated. "
"That's why, we have to check the availabilities of water or moisture in soil. "
"When they are filled, they become stiff and your plant stands upright. "
"When there is a lack of water, the cells deflate and the plant looks wilted - a clear sign Notes your plant needs more water. "
Plants produce cellulose that help to keep its shape.
"Water slowly as soil absorbs, not too quickly "
Water the plants with less quantity and slowing increase. 
Water the roots from very close distance.
" if you water from the  height,  the  soil  spreads  and  plant  will  not  have  any support to stand on the ground. "
Water the root zone.
Water the plants when it is needed.
"In our homes, vegetables, fruits are essential ingredients of our food. "
"We should try to grow these vegetables and fruits at our home in our kitchen garden as per the local climate. We should sow seeds according to season, give organic fertilizers and water. "

Hindustani music is a very complex and a  beautiful tradition of music that goes back over 3500 years. 
It originated from Indian music and is more popular in the north of India. 
"When you learn a language, you start with certain basic things like grammar and vocabulary."
then you start making your own sentences. 
"In Indian classical music also, you have to learn about the basic notes  or  swaras,  before  you  are  introduced  to  ragas  (musical themes).  After the mastery of the swaras, you are encouraged to start improvising and making your own melodies. "
"It is really not difficult  to  improvise  melodies,  once  you  have  mastered  the Swaras. "
In this lesson we shall learn about the origin of these swaras and their names. 
explain the origin of the Swaras; 
name the  Swaras in Indian classical music; 
identify their equivalents in animals and birds and 
describe the three main elements of music. 
When did you first experience the music? 
"When you were infant, whenever your mother wanted you to sleep,  whenever  she  wanted  to  feed  you,  to  console  you  etc. mother sung a song. "
"Eating, sleeping, playing and anything was done with songs being sung by your mother or any other lady in the  house. "
" These  songs  used  many  types  of  music,  such  as classical, semi-classical, light etc. "
Let us hear a story to understand better about the origin of these swaras.
"Ravivarma, king of Kalinga forest, was a tiger. "
He was looking after all the animals as his own family members. 
Ravivarma always liked listening to the music and singing. 
He himself was a great singer. 
Everyone admired his talent for music. 
Once he wanted to know if there was any other animal who can sing like him. 
Therefore he organized a competition for all the animals and birds. 
Everyone thought that ''I'm the best singer in the world and  
Ravivarma  will  select  me  only'.  
"They  all  started  singing together.  But you know how disturbing, it is if everyone sings at the same time. "
"King Ravivarma said, 'I cannot select the best singer if you all sing  together'. "
" Then  Ravivarma  asked  all  the  animals,  birds, reptiles, insects etc to register for the competition. "
"Wild animals, domestic animals and forest birds registered for the competition as all wanted to win the competition. "
"After everyone registered in the competition, the king started calling    them  one  by  one  on  the  stage  to  show  their  talent before the jury. "
It was really a great competition.  It continued for almost 4 - 5 days. 
"On the last day of the competition, they were all very eager to know the results. "
"This competition was very special.  They selected 7 animals and birds among all and not just one, out of thousands. "
In order to standardize the competition they said that the ''Swara'' will be made standard. 
"All singers, were asked to follow the norms and standards. "
"Peacock, cow, goat,  heron,  nightingale,  horse  and  elephant  were  selected winners. "
The jury fixed 7 Swaras corresponding these animal as follows: 
the rapturous sound of the peacock when rain clouds gather in the sky
the bellowing of a cow when her calf is separated from her  
the bleating of a goat in a flock 
the cry of a heron
the sound of the Indian Kokila (nightingale) in spring 
the neighing of a horse
the trumpeting of an elephant
Even today the Indian classical music is very much set to these standard Swaras. 
"A swara is the selected pitches from which the musician constructs the scales, melodies and ragas. "
Swara is a Sanskrit word that connotes a note in the successive steps of the octave. 
An octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with double its frequency. 
"In music, the pitch of a note means how high or low the note is. "
A swara is the selected pitch. 
"North Indian and South Indian classical music are two distinct traditions,  but  they  share  many  similarities  like  the  seven swaras. "
"Ancient Indians were deeply impressed by the spiritual power of music, and it is out of this that Indian classical music was born. "
Most music has at least 3 main elements. 
"The  melodies  of  Indian  music  are  based  on  ragas (in southern India, ragam). "
"Like a scale, the raga is a list of the notes that are used in a particular piece of music. "
Raga is a set of Swaras. 
"The  rhythms  of  Indian  music,  rather  than  being organized into short measures, are organized in long rhythmic cycles called talas (in southern Indian thaalam). There are more than 106 different talas. "
""
"In a performance, the rhythm has an important role as it gives texture and a sense of purpose to the melody. "
"Taal or Talas, literally a  clap,  is  the  term  used  in  the  Indian  Carnatic  music  for  the rhythmic pattern of any composition and for the entire subject of rhythm. "
Rhythm performs the role of a time counter. 
A Taal is a rhythmic cycle of beats on a percussive instrument. 
Each such pattern has its own name.  Each repeated cycle of Taal is called as avartana. 
"The  harmony  is  mainly  supplied  by  instruments such as the sitar, tanpura or santoor. "
Harmony in Indian classical music is mainly the result of the tanpura playing a combination of  the  tonic  (sa)  and  the  fifth  (pa)  or  fourth  (ma)  in  a  fixed pattern in the background. 
The Tanpura instrument has four long  strings. 
" The  strings  are  plucked  one  after  the  other, continuously throughout the music. "
"It takes about 5 seconds for one four-string cycle to be plucked, and although the drone itself  is constant. "
Songs and poems can be sung in different Ragas. 
"While singing if you add rhythm, song will be more enjoyable. "
With Raga and Tala any song will be really soothing. 
The  combination  of  Raga  and  Tala  set  to  a  song  makes  the music. 
"Ragas and Talas can be produced through vocal cords, instruments  etc.  "
"Whichever  Swara  you  are  singing  in  your voice can be replicated in Veena, Flute, Sitar, guitar, clarinet, keyboard,  violin  etc. "
" Whichever  Tala  is  being  indicated  in your voice can be produced on Tabala, Mridanga, Ghata, drums etc."
Explain the following terms
How does the Tanpura helps to create harmony?
Briefly  discuss  the  method  of  making  singing  of  song soothing and melodius.

I am curious to know what she adds in the food. 
I have to ask either my mom or my teacher. 
One fine day there was a lecture in my school on the same topic. 
The diet doctor told us many health benefits of food items which we eat on regular basis. 
She also warned us not to eat junk food as well as processed and packaged food. 
"She emphasized to have seasonal, local and fresh foods. "
"She also shared her childhood memories at her grandmother's place, how she grinds idli batter in stone pestle and mortar and cook sambhar in stone vessel on slow  fire. "
 I  was  recalling  the  difference  in  kitchen  and  food between my grandma house in village and my mom's kitchen in the city. 
"The  diet  doctor  told  us  when  you  can  memorize  the  names of  rivers,  mountains,  historical  places,  scientific  principles, mathematical  formulas,  don't  you  think  you  must  know the  ingredients  of  your  food  and  benefits  of  them. "
" To  learn something  about  different  kitchens  and  nutritional  and  health benefits  of  some  commonly  consumed  food,  this  lesson  is designed. "
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to:"
explain the food and its importance in our life;
differentiate traditional and modern food and kitchen;
listing of 20 items used in the kitchen; and
identify at least one health benefit of each ingredient.
The term 'food' refers to anything that we eat or drink and which nourishes  the  body. 
" It  includes  solid,  semi-solid  and  liquid."
"Food can be obtained from plant, animals and sea sources. "
"Hence there are plant foods, animal foods and sea foods. "
Each type of food has different proportion of nutrients. 
"and varies in colour, taste, flavour and appearance"
"Food contains mainly six nutrients, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and water. "
Many foods including spices and herbs contain some health protective compounds. 
Due to the presence of nutrients and health protective  compounds  food  performs  some  of  the  following functions
"Get energy to work, walk, jump, play etc. Grow and develop physically and mentally. "
Repair and revive body during rest and sleep. 
Protect the body from infection and diseases. Improve internal body functions. 
"When I entered the kitchen to more about kitchen and food, I found my many utensils to cook food and eat food. "
"Mom told me  that  chapati  is  made  on  tawa,  dal  in  pressure  cooker  and vegetables in either pressure cooker or karai. "
"Dry raw ingredients  like  pulses,  salt,  sugar,  tea  leaves  are  kept  in  suitable  size containers which are kept inside the cabinet. "
Salt and sugar are added to food to make food salty and sweet. 
 Fruits and vegetables and butter are kept inside the refrigerator to keep them fresh for long time. 
Since they contain more water they can spoil easily. 
Milk is also kept at low temperature and boiled 2-3 times in a day to avoid spoilage or kept in refrigerator and thus we buy milk daily. 
Mom also told me different types of foods which are used to prepare wide variety of dishes from chapati to halwa and dal to dhokla. 
"Broadly raw ingredients used in making different dishes include cereals, pulses, milk, meat, egg, fish, fruits, vegetables, sugar and fats and oils. "
"The cereals like wheat, jowar, bajra, ragi, oats, barley and rice, are used to make chapati, naan, bread, plain rice pulav etc. "
"They are  eaten  in  large  amounts  so  we  get  good  amount  of carbohydrates,  proteins,  vitamins  and  minerals. "
Whole  grains provide more nutrients including fiber while milling (removal of seed coat) reduces vitamins and fiber. 
Thus eating refined flour like maida is less nutritious. 
"Pulses are of many types such as chana, kabuli chana, rajmah, arhar,  moong,  urad,  massor. "
They  are  used  with  seed  coat  or without  coat. 
 Some  of  them  are  soaked  overnight  to  reduce cooking time. 
They are boiled or pressure cooked. 
They are good source of plant proteins. 
Germinated pulses are also used which provide extra vitamin C. 
"Milk and milk products such as  curd,  butter  milk,  paneer, cheese,  khoa  are  used  many people of all age groups and in sweet and salty dishes. "
"Indian sweets  like  burfi,  rosogulla, rabri, milk cake, kulfi are age old tasty dishes and even today relished worldwide. "
They are rich source of protein and calcium but poor source of iron and vitamin C. 
"Animal  foods  like  egg,  meat  and  fish  are  rich  in  fat,  protein, vitamins and minerals."
 but poor in fiber and carbohydrates. 
People eating these foods are called non-vegetarians. 
Fruits and vegetables are found in wide variety. 
They are very colourful and juicy. 
"Fruits are generally eaten raw like apple, mango,  banana,  watermelon. "
 Vegetables  are  usually  cooked before eating. 
"Potato, sweet potato, carrot are grown under the soil  and  contain  good  amount  of  starch  hence  called  starchy foods."
"Green leafy vegetables such as spinach, fenugreek (methi) are  good  source  of  vitamins and some minerals. "
They can spoil  faster  because  they contain  more  water. 
" Other vegetables  like  cauliflower, cabbage, beans, lauki, parwar also contain health promoting substances and add colour and variety in meal. "
Fats and oils are usually used to cook and fry the food. 
"Butter is usually used without cooking to add  flavour,  e.g. spread  on  the bread slice. "
Desi ghee is used to season dal or vegetables. 
Besides energy  it  contains  some  health protecting compounds. 
"Vegetables oils are obtained from soya bean, mustard, ground nut etc, "
they are used in cooking including frying. 
 Refining  of  vegetable  oils  reduces  health  protecting benefits. Solid fat like trans fat is very harmful to heart and other organs in the body. 
"Many people like to eat sweets after meal, on happy and festive occasion; "
"add sugar in tea, coffee and other drinks. "
White sugar is  used  which  is  only  simple  carbohydrate .
It should  be consumed in minimum amount. 
Jaggery and honey are also sweet but have some vitamins and minerals. 
Some foods like dry fruits and nuts are power house of nutrients and eaten for health promotion and health protection. 
Since they contain  high  amount  of  fat  and  other  components  they  are consumed in small amount only. 
Spices and herbs are commonly used to make our daily food appealing and tasty. But they contain many health promoting compounds thus they provide many health benefits.
Rich in good quality of fat and Good for brain eyes and skin

"These are prayers asking for good milk, to escape poverty by gifts of cows, for worship of cow and fulfilling desires. "
"Sage Valmiki's  Ramayana Aranya Kanda, Sarga 14  describes birth of Kamadhenu. "
She lived in the hermitage Ashram of saga Vasishtha and provided all products  necessary for sacrifices. 
The Ramayana Balakanda describes how king Kaushika tried to capture the cow by force.
King Kaushik was defeated by powers of sage Vasishtha. 
King Kaushika left for the forest giving up his kingdom.
He did penance for long years and become sage Vishvamitra.

"Preetam asks Ramu 'Kaka, why have you tied a cow in the shed? What does it give? Ramu the milkman replies 'Preetam, My cow is very Good. "
She gives me milk. 
I will take the remaining milk after she gives it to her baby calf. 
 Rigveda  mentions  that  cows  were  milked.
This Veda also gives knowledge of those prayers by which cows probably give more milk.
Milk was offered to the God and also used in sacrifices. 
Kautilya Arthashastra  gives  norms  of  milking    according  to season. 
Ayurvedic texts give the properties of milk. 
Cowherds  apply oil to the udders of cow before milking them. 
The first stream of milk is offered to Goddess Earth. 
The second stream is given to the calf and  only later the milk is drawn for our use. 
The milk is collected in a pot. 
"Preetam asks 'Kaka, what should I do with the milk in the pot?  Ramu says, 'Boil the milk after taking it to your home on a gas stove. "
See that milk does not spill over. 
Then off the gas stove and allow milk to cool in the pot. 
"After the milk is cooled, one can pour it  in a glass, offer it is to God."
This offering is done as a thanksgiving gesture to the God.
The remaining milk is to be converted to curds. 
Preetam asks Ramu Kaka 'How to convert milk to curd? 
Ramu says 'put a small amount of lime or curds of the previous day  into the milk that has cooked.  Keep it for a night. The next day one gets curd. 
Bacteria in milk get it converted to curd.
 If curds is mixed with water and diluted one gets buttermilk. 
Buttermilk is thin.
Use lemon juice or previous day's curd to make curd.
Taste the fresh curd by adding one spoon of sugar to it.

  It was churned with wood.
  Ancient Indian women used to sing songs while churning.
By  churning  buttermilk  one  gets  butter. 
"After receiving the butter, it is offered to Lord Shri Krishna."
Then taken by oneself butter can be taken by young  person  as  well  as  by  old  people. 
 It  gives  strength  and nourishes the body. 
"Freshly churned butter is sweet, cooling, light to digest and confers intellect. "
Butter increases intelligence as well.
Old butter causes diseases due to its sour taste. 
Another product  of the cow is Ghee. 
It is called clarified butter. 
"When butter is put in a container and heated, it melts and becomes ghee. "
"Freshly formed ghee gives wisdom, "
"good skin features, memory, strength and nourishment. "
It cleanses the human body 
It is  also  used  as  an  obtain  for  offering  in  the  sacrificial fire. 
It is praised as life itself in Vedic times. 
One must employ fresh ghee in consumption  during meals daily at least a spoonful. 
There are two other products of a cow that are considered good. 
These are its urine and dung. 
"Ramu says ""in my young day just like you, my elders did  not have casting gas. "
They collected firewood from forest to make fire. 
The forest was full of wild animals. 
The cows had to be protected. 
So a separate shed was constructed for them. 
"Grass, straw and leaves of trees were given to the cows they chewed then throughout  the day and the waste products formed dung in their body. "
They release the dung and urine. 
Cow dung was collected in a bucket and smeared over the walls. 
The walls were plastered with cow dung.
It was also smeared in from the house using a broom. 
It is collected and used for cooking after drying.
The cow dung is made in circular form keeping the same thickness.
 When  there  is  shortage  of firewood cowdung cakes were used. 
Cow  dung  should  not  be  allowed  to  accumulated  in  Goshala. 
"It must be collected and removed as early as possible, "
spread  out  in  the  sunlight  and  dried. 
This prevents fly and other insects.
  These insects can lay eggs in cow dung.
"Alternatively, cowdung can be used to feed a digester to prepare Gobar Gas. "
This is an excellent source of fuel energy 
It can be used for  cooking or along with fertilizers it can be used for agricultural purposes. 
 Cow  dung  keeps  environment  free  from  pollution. 
Therefore in ancient times the walls of houses were coated with cow dung.
"Cow's  urine  was  also  used  for  purification  purposes.  It prevents some diseases, improves soil fertility when used for agriculture."
Cow urine is very useful for agricultural works.
The  five  products  received  from  the  cow  as  discussed  above
"The  five  products  are milk,  cured,  ghee,  cow  dung  and  urine  "
These are  termed collectively as 'Panchagavya'. 
They enhance the body's immunity when used individually or collectively. 
Many diseases are cured by Panchagavya medicines. 
"Some  Ayurvedic  texts,  like  Pakadarpana  of  king  Nala, Bhojanakutuhala  of  Raghunatha  give  the  properties  of Panchaganya of cows. "

"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
Explain different types of industries
Describe different industrial products.
"Industries are mainly divided into two kinds :Small-scale industries,Large-scale industries."
Our Industries  Small  and  large-scale  industries  help  in  the  development  of  the country.

"Depending  upon  the  raw  material  used,  they  can  be  classified  as"
Some  people  manufacture  articles  either  at  home  or  in  other  small  places  by  using  the  necessary  machinery.
Such  manufacturing units are called small-scale industries.
"Leather  work industry, pottery, carpentry and handloom industry are some  examples."
Industries which undertake the manufacturing of goods on a large  scale by employing a large number of workers and using big  machinery  are  called  large-scale  industries.
"Those  producing  sugar,  cement,  automobiles,  radio,  T.V. etc. are  large-scale industries"

explain various agricultural operations
describe the methods to grow crops
learn techniques to protect crops
explain seasonal cropping patterns.
Agricultural  operations  include  various  steps.
Ploughing  and  harrowing are done before sowing.
"Once sowing is done, other  processes like irrigation, weeding, adding manures and fertilizers,  spraying of insecticides, cutting, harvesting, beating of cobs with  sticks, willowing and cleaning of grain, etc. are undertaken."
Then  the grains duly cleaned are stored in gunny or plastic bags and  sent to the market.
The farmers retain some of the grains for their  own domestic consumption.
It is very necessary to constantly watch the health and proper  growth of the crops.
This is to protect them from diseases.
For proper growth of crops it is necessary to provide manures and  fertilizers to the crops in the optimal doses.
It is also necessary to protect the crops  from birds and animals.
Spraying of insecticides and pesticides  helps protect the crops from insects and diseases.
There are mainly two types of crops depending upon the seasons  : Kharif crops and Rabi crops.
Crops that are sown at the beginning of the rainy season in the  month of June of July are called Kharif crops.
"For example, bajra,  rice, moong, groundnut, cotton, etc."
Crops  that  are  sown  in  the  winter  season  and  cut  before  the  summer season are called Rabi crops.
"For example, wheat, gram,  Notes  jowar etc."
Crops which grow on rain water are known as rain fed or Barani  Crops.

Explain various functions of food
Know  functions or different nutrients
explain nutritive components of various foods and
describe  the  process  to  choose  different  food  rich  in  a  nutrient.

What  is  being  cooked  in  your  house today? 
We all eat food.
"We may eat food of many varieties-roti, rice or dosa, meat or vegetables"
but food is imporant for all of us.
Let us try and understand the reasons why all human beings eat food.
 Can you list the reasons?  
The food that we eat performs three important functions
"These are :  Physiological function, Social function, Psychological function "
" All living beings whether man or animal, require food for their growth and development."
"Without food, there would be no life."
"Thus,  the  primary  function  of  food  is  physiological."
This  is fulfilled in the following ways.
 When we work we need energy.
"Even when we reset, we  need  some  amount  of  energy  to  carry  out  the  basic  body functions."
Food provides energy to the body.
A young child needs food to grow.
"Even when we are healthy, our body tissues need to be built and old tissues need replacement."
Food provides us the resistance to fight against the diseases.
"Food has always been a means of extending hospitality, good will and friendship amongst people in all cultures."
Exotic dishes are prepared and served to guests on special occassions.
"During festivals, it is seen in communities that each household prepares similary special foods which are shared."
"Thus, food brings people together and binds them in a special way"
thus giving food a very important social value.
Food also performs an important psychological function.
It is seen that we use food as a means of expressing our emotions.
 Gandhiji's hunger strikes effectively communicated his disagreement with the British policies.
They also touched the hearts of millions of Indians and motivated htem to actively join the freedom struggle.
Food  also  gives  us  a  sense  of  well  being  the  security.
Eating habits  of  poeple  have  been  known  ot  vary  in  different psychological conditions.
"For example, when nervous or under stress, some people keen eating continuously while others turn away from food."
"Thus,  food  has  many  more  functions  other  then  supplying nutrients for health."
 List the functions of food
"Besides being tasty, food must also be nutritious."
"In different foods,  cartain  substances  known  as  ""nutrients""  are  found  in varying degrees."
"There are five main nutrients found in all food stuffs. These  are  -  Carbohydrates,  Proteins,  fats,  mineral  and vitamins."
"In  order  to  make  food  nutritious,  there  must  be  a balanced consumption of all these."
"Such a diet is known as a ""Balanced Diet"" and is it essential for healthy living."
"Do you remember Ramu, Velu and Rahim?"
Let us go to their houses today and see what is cooking.
Ramu's  mother  is  a  very  good  cook.
Let  us  see  what  she has  cooked  today.
"Dal,  Gobi Aloo  Sabzi, Parantha,  Curd and Kheer too!"
Seems to be a special occassion !
What could it be?
"Velu's mother has made Rasam, Boiled rice, Sambhar, Kuttu, Sweet Curd and Mysorepak."
All are Velu's favourite dishess he is coming back fromt he hostel today.
Everyone today seems to be cooking delicious mouth watering food.
"But food must not only be tasty, it must also be nutritious."
Do you remember the five nutrient components of food which make the food nutritious?
"Yes, they are : Carbohydrates,Proteins,Fats, Minerals  and  Vitamins"
All foods have these five nutrients but in varying amounts.
Certain foods are very rich in one or two of the above.
"Hence, they form rich sources of these nutrients in our diet."
For example : Milk and meat are rich sources of protein.
Each nutrient proforms an important  physiological  function.
"Hence,  our  diet  must  be  a balance  mix  of  all  these  nutrients."
Following  functions  are performed by each nutrient
These make the bulk of our diet & are our chief source of energy.
Main souces are :
"Cereal grains - wheat, rice, bajra."
"Tubers - potato, sweet potato."
"Sugar, Jaggery"
These  serve  as  the  major  source  of  body  building  material.
Proteins are found both in animals and plants.
"Main vegetarian sources  of  protein  are-Soyabean, pulses, cereals,milk, paneer, gound-nuts"
"Non-vegetarian sources of this are - meat, fish, eggs."
These are energy rich foods.
"Nuts such as groundnut, butter and ghee form milk, vanspati, vegetable oils are all rich sources of fat."
They are required for the maintenance of good health.
Vegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins.
They are required for protection.
Rich sources are vegetables and fruits.
We need to drink water because if is of great importance to the body.
It is used to transport all other nutrients to various parts of the body.
80% of the human body is acutally water.
Fill in the functions of nutrients.
Match the following foods with their nutrients
explain nutritive components of various foods 
Functions of different nutrients
  describe  the  process  to  choose  different  food  rich  in  a nutrient.
Their importance in life
What are the important functions of food?
List the five nutrient components of food.
Let  us  observe  the  cooking  process.
"Some  foods  are  cooked  in  water,  and  others  in  oil."
"Yet,  others  are  cooked  on  direct  flame."
"Why do we cook at all, if we can eat raw food? "
Can  you  think  of  some  reasons for cooking food? 
Check to see if you can list all the reasons.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to"
Explain the reasons for cooking food
describe various methods used in cooking?
Cooked food is easy to digest
Take some wheat and try to eat it  raw.
Now take some wheat dough and Lets Cook  make a Roti.
A roti is easy to eat
Roti is easy to  digest
Is'nt it?
Cooking enhances the taste of food 
Try eating a raw potato or brinjal.
How does it taste?
"Now try the potato, chopped into small  pieces and sprinkle some salt and pepper on it."
Do you notice any  change from the raw form? Yes.
" the colour, taste, texture and the  flavour of the fried potato pieces would be much better then the  raw form."
Cooking adds variety to food 
Let us try and think or the various products which can be made with potatoes.
"Now let us write  down some of them - pakora, potato curry, potato parantha, dum  aloo, potato chaat..the list is long, indeed."
Cooked food has a longer shelf life
""
"Don't you think that the  boiled milk, cooked sarson ka saag stay for a longer time? "
"Oh! yes, definitely."
Perishable commodities like vegetables and milk  stay longer if cooked.
"But foods like dals, wheat, rice stay longer  when not cooked."
Cooking makes our food safe 
"Due to the application of heat during cooking, micro-organisms are killed by the heat."
This  makes the food safe for human consumption.
read carefully and tick for  the  true  and  the  false  statement
Cooking process kills the harmful micro-organisms.
The flavour of carrots does not change on cooking  
Cooked spinach has more shelf life then raw spinach.
The texture of potato does not change after cooking.
"Do you remember our friends : Ramu, Velu and Rahim?"
"Let us  see, what they are faving for breakfast."
"Ramu is having gobi-  praranthas, Velu Idli-sambhar, Rahim Samosas and Chutney."
"Idlis  are steamed, samosas fried and pranthas roased on a tawa."
So  cooking can be with
Moist heat - idli
Dry heat - parantha
Frying - Samosas
The question arises Why  is  cooking  done  by  various  methods?
"it  done  by  various  methods  provides  variety  in  the  taste,  flavour  and  texture."
Now let us study the various methods of cooking in greater details.
These can be boadly classified as
"Moist Heat ,Dry Heat, Frying"
Food is cooked with water as the cooking medium.
Let us list  down the methods of cooking with moist heat  
"Boiling ,Steaming, Pressure cooking"
Can you recall two things which are boiled? Yes.
Potato and rice are the two things which instantly  come to one's mind.
"After the potatoes are boiled, we discard the left-over water."
"For boiling rice, we use just sufficient amount of water,"
" the water is absorbed, when the rice is being cooked."
Use just sufficient amount of water 
water only cover the food product.
 keep this in mind
"If  excess  water  is  discarded,  we  loss  all  the  water  soluble  nutrients."
Put the food to be cooked in boiling water.
If  it  is  covered  with  a  lid  the  steam  quickens  the  cooking  process
beacuse of this reason the water does not evaporate.
"Use the left over liquid, rich in water soluble nutrients, for  making dals, curries, soups and for making dough."
the food to be cooked is not in contact with the  water
but is cooked in steam of the boiling liquid.
"Idli, dhokla  and  vegetables  are  some  of  the  items  which  are  cooked  by  steaming."
Steam will be formed only when the water boils.
"Use a light fitting lid, so that the steam is retained inside."
Food is light & easy to digest
"therefore, it is recommended for patients and the aged."
Oil or ghee is not used.
"Food is not overcooked, as it is a slow method of cooking "
 and food is not in direct contact with heat.
Here the food is cooked in steam under  pressure.
For this we use a special device called a pressure cooker.
The pressure cooker has a rubber gasket that seals the pain and  its lid
"thus, no steam escapes."
"Since the steam is under pressure,  the temperature attained is much higher and the food is cooked  much faster."
The weight (whistle) controls the pressure built up  inside the cooker.
"When the whistle blows, one should lower the  flame."
"Thus, temperature is controlled in the cooker and food  does not get burnt."
  Advantages of Pressure Cooking
Quick method.
Less water is used.
Nutrients and flavour are retained.
Hot air is used as a medium of cooking here.
This method is used  in
"baking,Roasting"
Food  is  cooked  in  a  tandoor  or  an  oven.
Heat  generated from the fire rotates around the food in the form of hot  air and this cooks the food.
"Some examples of baked products  are - cakes, bread etc."
How to make an oven at home
Take an empty oil tim & cut its upper lid.
Put a layer of mud and sand inside the tin.
"Now heat the tin on coal, gas or kerosene stove."
Put food to be cooked in this pot tin and put the lid on it.
Cook on slow fire.
Do not open the cover of the oven very frequently 
as cold air enters to make the food hard and dry.
A cooker put inside down on the flame can also be used as a  Tandoor.
Food to be cooked is in direct contact with heat 
"for eg.-hot air, sand, fire."
"are some other foods be which can roasted are- roti on tawa, brinjal in fire,Sweet potato, paneer, potato etc."
Hot oil is used as a medium for cooking here.
"When  we  fry  pakoras,  puris  or  samosas,  they  are  completely  immersed in oil."
This is called Deep Fat Frying.
It is a quick  method of cooking.
"How do we fry a parantha, dosa or an egg,a small amount of oil  is taken in a frying pan or tawa."
This is called Shallow Fat Frying.
More ghee is absorbed by this method or frying.
Always use oil which is hot for frying.
Food when put in cold  oil absorbs more oil  
"due to which food may get broken,"
"for example- cutlets, when put is cold oil making the oil dirty"
"Before frying, cover the food item to be fried with a layer of  maida, suji, egg or besan."
This helps to increase the flavour  and the taste of the food being cooked.
"Whatever oil is left after frying, should be strained and put in  a closed utensil"
 used for cooking as usual.
Tick for the statements that are true for pressure cooking  and for the statements which are false for pressure cooking
Quick method
No direct contact with water
Less water is used
No special equipment is needed for pressure cooking
"Yoga is an ancient spiritual science that seeks to bring the mind, body and spirit in balance"
"The word 'Yoga' is derived from the sanskrit root 'Yuj' which means to attach, join, harness or yoke"
"By practicing the different yoga techniques you will achieve good health, relaxation, and inner fulfillment"

"It additionally helps in expanding adaptability, muscle quality and body tone"
Overall it improves breathing and vitality
After studying this lesson you will be able to: explain the importance of yoga
"trace the history of yoga, list different techniques of yoga, describe the basics of yoga"
"Thousands of years ago, the ancient Rishis (sages) lived in the forest, mountains, and the caves of India"
"They observed their environment,  and  saw  how  the  animals  and  nature  moved  in perfect harmony"
"They imitated the movements of the animals, the trees, the mountains, and even the movements of the stars, and created a wonderful technique called Yoga."
It helps to inculcate healthy habits and adoption of a healthy lifestyle to achieve good health
"Teaching of yoga at the school level, will help to encourage a positive  and  healthy  lifestyle  for  better  physical,  mental  and emotional health of children"
"Practice of yoga will help in the development of strength, stamina, endurance and high energy at the physical level in the children"
"Besides, yoga empowers one with increased concentration, calm, peace and contentment at the mental level."
"Yoga is not a part of any religion, it is a way of living that aims towards a healthy mind in a healthy body."
"Other forms of physical exercises, like aerobics, assure only physical well-being."
They have little to do with the development of the spiritual or astral body
Yogic exercises are important in : Attainment of perfect equilibrium and harmony
Self-healing - Removing negative blocks from the mind and toxins from the body
"Enhancing personal power, Living with greater awareness"
"Developing attention, focus and concentration, especially for children"
"Reducing stress and tension, Improving your posture and flexibility"
"Building better relationships, Improving your self-confidence"
Improving your memory and concentration
"Helping you sleep better, Aiding good digestion"
"The development of yoga can be traced back to over 5,000 years"
"But some researchers think that yoga may be up to 10,000 years old"
"The science of Yoga has its origin thousands of years ago, long before the first religions or belief systems were born"
"In the yogic tradition, Shiva is seen as the first Yogi or Adiyogi, and the first Guru or Adi Guru"
"The Number of seals and fossil remains discovered in Indus Saraswati valley civilization show yogic  activities  and  figures  performing Yoga,  "
suggesting the presence of Yoga in ancient India
The above pictures are the seals excavated from the Mohenjodaro site  show Pashupati ( Lord Shiva)  in yogic posture (Bhadrasana)
They were sitting cross-legged with arms outstretched
The pose was of meditative state
"We can say that the history of Yoga is approximately over 5000 years old, starting from the pre-vedic era and continuing till date"
The History of Yoga  can be divided into five  main periods : 
Vedic Yoga is portrays ritualistic ceremonies
It can be traced back to the period of Rig Veda
"Great explorers of early yoga, naming a few, are Vasistha, Yajanavalkya etc"
"This the main source, from which we get documented  information about Yoga practices and the related literature during this period, are available in Upanishad texts"
Yoga was slowly refined and developed  by  Rishis  (mystic  seers) 
They documented  their practices and beliefs in the Upanishads
"The classical period is defined by Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, the first systematic presentation of yoga"
This was written sometime in the second century
"This text describes the path of Raja Yoga, often called ‘Classical Yoga'."
Patanjali is often considered the father of Yoga
His Yoga Sutras still strongly influence most styles of modern yoga
"A few centuries after Patanjali, many yoga masters have created a system of practices designed to rejuvenate the body and prolong life which is called as Hatha Yoga"
Listed below are  the few of the Hatha Yoga Texts.
"Hatha Yoga was strongly promoted in India by the intensive work of  T. Krishnamacharya,  Swami  Sivananda  and  other  yogis practicing Hatha Yoga"
"In the modern period Swami Vivekananda spread the wisdom of Yoga to the world, especially in the west"
"He classified the Yoga into four, namely: Karma Yoga, Raja Yoga, Bhakthi Yoga and Jnana Yoga"
"Teaching of yoga at the school level, will help to encourage a positive and healthy life style."
Patanjali's Yoga Sutras is the first systematic presentation of yoga
"Vasistha, Yajanavalkya  are great explorers of early yoga"
In the modern period  Swami Vivekananda spread the wisdom of yoga to the world.
"Yoga at an early age, shapes young minds and bodies."
"giving tools that will enhance and support children to be balanced, creative, and tension free individuals"
"It promotes self esteem, concentration  and  body  awareness  and  the  ability  to  steer smoothly through life's challenges"
"Physically, yoga enhances body coordination it has a powerful effect on brain development, and leads to heightened focus"
"Now  a  days,  you  all  are  overstressed  with  the  pressure  to accomplish, in a world flooded with information"
Yoga is a tool that teaches you healthy ways to release stress to bring your bodies back  into  equilibrium
"Yoga  builds  strength,  confidence  and resilience."
"Remember that a strong body is able to digest food better, breathe better and withstand stress"
"The practice of yoga can help you to self regulate, besides being a wonderful aid to promote mental health and combat attention disorders"
Briefly the aims and objectives of Yoga education at an early age are to: 
enable you to have good health
practice mental hygiene and possess emotional stability
integrate moral values
and attain higher level of consciousness
Yoga helps to achieve all these objectives in an integrated manner
Regular practice of Yoga helps - In encouraging self esteem and body awareness
In maintaining flexibility and strengthening the growing bodies
"To enhance concentration, memeory and IQ"
"Anger management, To build present moment awareness"
It helps to manage anxiety and stress
Helps in developing creativity
Developing cordial peer and social interactions
Bringing emotional stability and Inculcating moral values
Developing discipline and responsibility
Every one of us want to be happy! 
Happiness directs our lives.
"To overcome the pain and to achieve happiness, all humans practice the yoga"
"This natural feeling is found not only in human beings, but also in animals."
"Yoga is a very ancient science that helps us not only to develop flexibility in our body, but also strengthens it."
It also brings happiness and peace of mind also
Yoga  believes that happiness is our natural state
"When the body and the mind are out of balance, we cannot experience this happiness"
"With the help of yoga poses, breathing exercises, focusing within and  meditation, we can bring back this harmony of body and mind, "
and achieve this natural state of happiness
"At  the  base  of  the  yoga  practice  are  the  following  five  basic principles: Proper exercise, Breathing, Relaxation, Diet, and Meditation"
"The practice of  Yoga has beneficial effects to every part of the body - muscles, joints, ligaments, blood circulation, digestion, etc"
We are what we eat
A proper diet should accompany a yoga practice to maintain a healthy physical body
"A diet of purely fresh, locally grown, and organic ingredients is recommended"
"Yoga emphasizes attention to breath, and taking long, deep inhalations that begin in the lower abdomen and fill up the entire chest cavity"
"This increases lung capacity and oxygen flow throughout the body, which clears and cleanses the mind"
One can achieve inner peace through proper relaxation leading to spiritual cleansing
The final but most important aspect of the yoga philosophy is positive thinking and meditation
"Meditation allows one a way to ease the constant chatter of the mind, and control it"
The basics of yoga according to the Upnishads : Our Upanishads says that our natural state is state of silence where our minds stops chattering
It is the state free of all thoughts or a state of peace
"When  your  mind  is  free  of  thoughts  it  is  a  state  of  bliss, knowledge and creativity"
Peace is important for all those who: are in search of greater and more permanent happiness and bliss
"seek knowledge, want to be totally free"
aspire to become more and more creative
An ideal society is one in which the above features are found
"It is constructed by setting up and observing the prescribed social norms and value system (Yamas and Niyamas) habits, customs, manners,  etiquettes,  etc"
These  will  help  us  to  move  in  the direction of peace
You have to work for such a spiritual setup.
You need to create such a environment where all individuals progress towards their goal of peace and the achievement of the required social values
You must work towards the creation of an Spiritualy Inclined Environment
"With  such  a  spiritual  background,  you  are  free from  over  stimulation,  unhealthy  competition,  comparison, stress and pressure to achieve unrealistic targets"
"Each soul is potentially divine as Swami Vivekananda puts it, every child is differently gifted"
Through yogic practices we should calm down our mind and nurture our area of interest and talent to achieve our potential
Yoga brings perfect equilibrium and harmony in the body and advances the mind making it powerful.
Dhyana reduces the fickleness of the mind and can control well
What is Yoga? What are the benefits of Yoga?
Trace the history of Yoga and explain how many periods it is divided into? Briefly explain those.
What are the objectives of Yoga? What are the basics of Yoga?
"Dear learner, Patanjali has given Ashtanga Yoga or eight steps of yoga."
"Those eight steps are Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi."
The first two steps that Patanjali describes are the fundamental ethical rule or code called Yamas and the Niyamas.
These can also be looked at as universal moral principles and personal observances.
Yamas deal with right personal attitude.
Niyamas are social disciplines as to how we deal with people around us.
It is advised we should match our inner attitude with the external action.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to : explain the basics of Yamas;"
list the types of Yamas;
explain the basics of Niyamas;
and list the types of Niyamas.
"Yama is mainly classified in five types : Ahimsa (non- violance), Satya (truth fullness), Asteya (non-sterling), Brahmcharya (chastity) and Aparigraha (non-possesiveness)."
Lets understand with story.
"One can hurt a person in three ways namely, by deeds, by words or by thought! All three forms of hurting are not good and one should avoid these."
Sometimes we hurt others without realizing it.
"Normally, you do harm without thought."
"One throw stones at animals without any reasons, catch insects, butterflies etc."
This is a pass time which gives much pain to these creatures.
Our shastras say that such acts invite punishment.
Here is a story which illustrates this law.
"In the past, there was a pious Maharshi called Mandavya."
He spent whole of his time in the forest doing Tapas.
He used to observe silence for long periods.
One day thieves entered the palace of the king of the land and stole some jewels.
"The guards woke up but before they could catch them, the thieves ran away with the jewels."
"The guards chased them and the thieves entered the forest, They then saw the Maharshi "
"Due to fear of guards, they dumped all the jewels near the Maharshi and escaped with their lives."
The guards saw the Maharshi with the eyes closed and all the stolen jewels lying in a heap near him.
They concluded that the Maharshi was the leader of the robbers and they presented him before the king along with the jewels.
The king was convinced that the Maharshi was guilty and ordered that he be put to death by being pierced by a spear.
"At the time of death, the Maharshi suddenly remembered that during his childhood he used to amuse himself by catching insects and pricking them with thorns and that the punishment that he was undergoing was the result of that sin."
He immediately instructed his disciples who were present there to be non-violent always.
We should therefore never willfully harm any creature however small it may be.
"Satya means ""to speak the truth,"" yet it is not always desirable to speak the truth on all occasions."
Because it could harm someone unnecessarily.
"We have to consider what we say, how we say it, and in what way it could affect others."
"If speaking the truth has negative consequences for another, then it is better to say nothing."
Let us understand the Satya by a story.
One day a wood cutter's axe accidentally fell into a river.
The poor wood cutter made a good search in the water.
But his efforts were in vain.
"Finally, he burst into tears."
"Hearing his sobs, God appeared before him."
The God disappeared into the river and came up carrying a golden axe.
The wood cutter did not accept it.
He stated that his axe was not made of iron.
God disappeared and soon returned with a silver axe.
The wood cutter again denied that it was his axe.
God once again plunged into the river.
It soon reappeared carrying the axe of the wood cutter.
He greeted the God with words of profuse thanks and great joy.
God was impressed by the man's honesty.
He presented him with the golden and silver axes in recognition of his truthful nature.
Asteya is a third part of Yama.
"Asteya means ""not to steal""."
"Lack of gratitude can fuel an unhealthy desire for things that we don't currently have, such as name brand clothes, or the most supped up car."
"The root cause of asteya comes from the thinking, ""I'm not good enough,"" and ""I don't have enough."" "
The need to steal essentially arises because of the lack of faith in ourselves to be able to create what we need by ourselves.
"The moment we feel a sense of ""lack"" in life; desire, want and greed emerge."
This steals our own contentment away from the things that we have now that are bringing purpose and happiness to our life.
Let us understand the Asteya by a story.
There was a diamond thief who stole only the most precious gems 
He spotted a well-known diamond merchant purchasing the most beautiful diamond and decided to steal it.
"He spent his entire time, trying to find the diamond, but despite all his endeavors he failed to locate it."
"When the train reached its destination the thief, restless in his incapacity, could not contain himself and told the merchant the truth;"
"Sir, I've been following you everywhere for the last three days trying to find the rare gem you purchased. I have not been able to get my hand on it."
Please tell me where you hide it .
"The merchant said: ""When I first saw you, I suspected you were a pickpocket "
and so hide the gem where I thought you'd never look-in your own pocket!
And with that he reached into the thief's pocket and brought out the amazing gem which was in the thief's possession all along.
"The above story of the thief and merchant shows that whatever we want to steal and are desperately seeking, is in our own pocket."
All we have to do is look!
"Aparigraha means to take only what is necessary, "
and not to take advantage of a situation or act greedy.
"We should only take what we have earned; if we take more, we are exploiting someone else."
Let us understand the Aparigraha by a story 
There is another great story about the wisdom of Tenali Rama.
"The famous King of Vijayanagar, Krishnadevaraya's, mother was a very pious and orthodox lady."
She had visited all holy places and given much of her treasures in charity to temples.
"Once she showed the desire of giving away the fruits in charity and her son, the king, obliged."
"Unfortunately, his mother died. Krishnadevaraya followed all religious rites."
"On the last day, the king called some brahmins and said, 'my mother's last wish was to offer mangoes to brahmins."
But she could not fulfil this wish and died.
What can I do so that my mother's last wish could be fulfilled and she can rest in peace?'
"The brahmins were greedy. They said that only if the king would give each brahmin a gold mango, would his mother be able to rest in peace."
Krishnadevarya on hearing this immediately ordered some gold mangoes to be made 
"and presented them to the Brahmins, thinking now his mother would be happy and peaceful."
There was a minister called Tenali Rama and he heard about this.
He called those brahmins to his home to perform the last rite ceremonies of his own mother.
All the brahmins came to Tenali's house. 
Tenali closed all the doors and windows and stood in front of them with a red hot iron rod.
"The brahmins were taken aback, but Tenali removed their confusion and told 'My mother had knee pains'"
And as a remedy she wanted me to cure her with these hot iron rods.
But she died before I could help her.
"So now I want to fulfil her wish by giving you all this treatment', Tenali said to the brahmins."
The greedy brahmins understood that they have not done right and they returned the mangoes to the King.
"Later, Tenali Rama told king Krishnadevarya that the treasure of the palace should not be exploited by giving them to such greedy people."
"Instead, it should be put to feed and serve the needy."
"The above, story of three bhramin's shows you that one should not be greedy."
And also shouldn't take more than they need.
"Niyama means ""rules"" or ""laws"" which should be followed "
These are the rules prescribed for personal observance.
"Like the Yamas, the five Niyamas are not exercises or actions to be simply studied."
They represent far more than an attitude.
"The first Niyama is Saucha, meaning purity and cleanliness."
Shaucha has both an inner and an outer aspect.
Outer cleanliness simply means keeping ourselves clean.
"Inner cleanliness has as much to do with the healthy, free functioning of our bodily organs as with the clarity of our mind."
Let us understand the Shaucha by a story.
"In a village there were three best friends - Mohan, Lalith and Arjun."
They studied in the same school.
All the three were good in their studies.
They all liked the school.
It was the place where they all met.
They never missed school.
Their village was very beautiful. Many tourists visited this place.
Once Arjun didn't come to school for five days.
Lalith and Mohan were worried.
They decided to visit Arjun.
They were shocked to see the place where he lived. It was very dirty.
When they reached Arjuns house they saw that he was down with very high fever.
His mother was crying badly.
"Arjun looked very soft and tired, He could hardly talk."
Malaria is a disease that is spread by mosquitoes.
His father told them that due to unhealthy living conditions very few tourists visited the place.
The next day the boys told the class about Arjun.
They decided to do something for their friend.
So they decided to clean the place during the weekend.
So the students gathered in the street and divided themselves into small groups and started cleaning the place.
"They swept the roads, collected the waste and threw it in the dustbin. They also cleared the dirty water."
"Thus, the mosquitoes became less."
They continued the cleaning process every week.
This was an eye opener for the people staying around.
They slowly started participating in the cleaning spree.
All were happy and the place became clean and tidy.
Very few people fell sick.
Tourists started visiting the village as before.
The principal appreciated the children in the assembly.
The district collector too appreciated the children for making the people aware.
The cleaning effort of the people of the village was shown on the TV.
Many states also adopted the cleaning movement.
Thus a small movement that started in a small village spread to the whole country.
"Finally, even the President one day declared that our India is a clean India."
"If we want our country to be a clean and healthy place to live,"
 we should first keep our house and surroundings clean.
"Not only external cleanliness, but internal cleanliness is also needed."
"Another Niyama is Santosha, modesty and the feeling of being content with what we have."
"To be at peace within and content with one's lifestyle, finding contentment, even while experiencing life's difficulties for life becomes a process of growth through all kinds of circumstances."
Let us understand the Santhosha by a story.
"Once, there was a king named Kushala."
He was a very kind king.
"He had everything, wealth, health, army, etc."
Kushala was the most powerful king.
"The only problem was that, he was not contented with whatever he had."
"As he was a kind king, the God gave him a blue magical crystal."
"Through it, King Kushala was able to transform into anything."
"As it was the day time, the sun was very bright and shiny. The king became jealous."
"With the help of the magical crystal, he transformed himself into the sun."
Suddenly there were clouds everywhere in the sky.
The clouds didn't even allow a single ray of the sun to reach the ground.
"The king was angry with the clouds, so he transformed into the clouds."
He had fun floating in the air.
"Suddenly, there was a mountain in his way."
"He thought that the mountain is stronger than a cloud. Thus, he turned into a mountain."
Suddenly there were some stone cutter coming to cut the stone from the mountain.
They began to cut down the stone from the mountain.
The king thought again that the stone cutters that follow the rules of the king are stronger than a big mountain.
"With the help of the magical crystal, he transformed into a stone cutter."
His king gave him the order to cut some stone and bring it to his soldiers.
"Finally, he decided to be a king again."
By the above story we can understand that being contented with what we have is very important.
Tapas refers to the activity of keeping the body fit 
and handle the inner urges without outer show.
"Literally, it means to heat the body and, by so doing, to cleanse it."
Behind the notion of Tapas lies the idea we can direct our energy to enthusiastically engage life and achieve our ultimate goal of creating union with the Divine.
Let us understand the Tapas by a story.
There is an inspiring story in the Kathopanishad about a little boy named Nachiketa.
He was the son of Udalak Rishi.
Once Udalak organized a yajna to please the deities.
It was customary in those days to donate cows to brahmins at the end of the Yajna.
Udalak was a miser brahmin
he donated old and weak cows to the brahmins.
None of the cows yielded any milk.
This disturbed Nachiketa.
"He asked his father about it, ""Father, to whom would you give me in charity?"" "
"This made his father very angry, but he decided not to say anything."
"When Nachiketa repeated the question, Udalak lost his temper and said, ""I give you to Yama."" "
He reached the Yama's kingdom and was told by Yama's guards that he had gone out for three days.
Nachiketa decided to wait on his doorstep till he returned.
"He waited for three days. No food, no water."
Yama returned on the fourth day and saw little Nachiketa at his doorstep.
"He felt pained for keeping a brahmin waiting without welcoming him, without food and water."
"Nachiketa declared, ""My first wish is, when I return home may my father welcome me lovingly."
My second wish is to grant me the knowledge by which I can be worthy of living in the heavens.
"My third wish is to grant me Atmagnanam -knowledge of the Atma."""
This story also inspires us to be kind to all creatures and to respect one's parents.
The fourth Niyama is Swadhyaya.
Swa means ‘self’ Adhyaya means ‘inquiry’ or ‘examination’.
You all know who Guru Dronacharya was ?
He was the royal Guru (teacher) of the Pandavas and Kauravas.
He used to teach military art to the princes.
"Once, a boy named Ekalavya asked Guru Dronacharya, ""Gurudev, will you teach me the art of archery?"" Ekalavya aspired to study archery in the gurukul of Dronacharya, the greatest known teacher."
Dronacharya was in a dilemna as he had promised King Bhishma that he will teach this art only to the princes.
"Ekalavya was not a prince, so Dronacharya was hesitant to teach him and he duly conveyed his refusal to Ekalavya."
"Deeply sad by Dronacharya's rejection, Ekalavya returned home."
"After practicing for years together, Ekalavya eventually became an exceptional archer."
Once Guru Dronacharya took the Pandava and Kaurava princes to the forest for practicing archery.
A dog was also accompanying them.
Dronacharya was amazed to see the dog's state.
He was wondering how such a success could be achieved.
"Dronacharya and his students investigated, and came upon Ekalavya, practicing archery."
"On seeing Dronacharya, Ekalavya was filled with joy. He bowed down to him."
"Dronacharya asked Ekalavya, ""Where did you learn archery?""."
"Pointing towards the clay statue, Ekalavya replied, ""Under you, O Guru."" "
Ekalavya had learnt archery by self introspect and effort with immense devotion and reverence towards his Guru Dronacharya.
"From the above, story of Ekalavya we can understand how he got mastery over archery through his Swadhyaya or self introspect."
In the previous lesson you have learnt Yama and Niyama with the help of relevant stories.
"You have understood that, Yamas are personal disciplines or restraints and Niyamas are social disciplines or observances."
Now in this lesson we are going to learn about the Asana and Pranayama.
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to : explain the terms Asana and Pranayama;"
list the types of Asana and Pranayama;

"Our ancient rishis of India based on their observations of nature - animals, birds etc. devised a number of asanas or postures."
"It is not by mere chance in Hatha yoga terminology, all the postures are named after the different animals of the jungle."
"Each posture or pose, whether the lion, camel, cat or peacock, has a purpose of its own."
Asana literally means 'seat'.
"An asana is a body posture, originally a sitting pose for meditation, "
"and later in hatha yoga and modern yoga as exercise, adding reclining, standing, inverted, twisting, and balancing poses to the meditation seats."
All asanas should be done by observing the stability - Sthiram.
Remember that all yogic postures or the yogasanas are performed slowly and with stability.
Asana is a gift given to us by ancient sages.
By regular practice of these Asanas one can live a long and healthy life.
"For doing these Asanas, one needs to learn to focus on the pose."
 and learn to align the body correctly in relation to how it functions.
"Alignment, balance and strength are key factors of all asanas."
Helps maintains flexibility and strength of muscular-skeletal system.
Increases concentration and focus by calming the mind.

"While the Padmásana, Siddhásana, the Vajrásana and the Sukhásana are known as the meditative postures."
All the remaining postures are called cultural postures.
These postures are meant essentially to develop the personality.
"To develop confidence, to overcome shyness and to become confident and dynamic, it is advised to practice the cultural asanas,"
"especially that involve back bending postures and the Chakrásana, Bhujangásana (the cobra postures)."
The Ardha Chakrásana (standing bending backward) and Suptavajrásana are also good.
These practices strengthen the chest and shoulders.
"People who are egoistic, are observe to always hold their shoulders back and heads up."
"For such people, humility can promoted by practicing the front bending postures like Paschimottánásana, Shashankasana, Padahastásana."
These are prescribed to help overcome the egotistic characters and to develop a pleasing and warmer personality.

Pranayama helps to make the breath slow and rhythmic.

What are the suggested guidelines for practicing Pratahara?
Explain the method of practicing Dharana.
Explain the special features of Dhyana.
Yoga is a discipline to improve or develop one's inherent power in a balanced manner.
It guide and offers the means to attain complete self-realization.
The literal meaning of the sanskrit word yoga is 'Yoke'.
Yoga can therefore be defined as a means of uniting the individual spirit with the universal spirit of god.
"In this lesson you will learn about Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi."
"After studying this lesson, you will be able to, explain the terms Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi, list the special features and benefits of Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi "
"And adopt the correct procedure for practicing, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi."
"Pratyahara is derived from the sanskrit word - prati, meaning ‘away’ or ‘against’, and ahara, meaning ‘nourishment’ or ‘food’."
"Therefore, the whole word denotes a withdrawal from what nourishes the senses."
Pratyahara means ‘withdrawal of the senses’.
"It's a powerful way to master your mind, cultivate inner peace, and boost your focus and concentration."
"Before we can actually teach kids to control their senses, they need to understand what they are required to do ."
"Start by identifying the five senses— sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell."
"Pratyahara is considered important in yoga helping the practitioner into concentration, meditation and, eventually, to the goal of samadhi (union with the Divine)."
"By withdrawing the focus from the senses and the external environment, the mind can turn inward, deepening yogic practice."
The main objective of Pratyahara is about training the mind to withdraw from the senses.
It allows the mind to be peaceful so that good concentration can be developed.
It helps to stay away from distraction or disturbance.
"This is crucial, especially at the beginning, and reduce the physical stimuli as much as you can."
"Sit comfortably on a chair, on the floor, or try to get into any other comfortable position of your choice."
"Probably it is not a good idea to lie down, because if you do, you might fall asleep."
"Remember, the idea is to remain conscious and not to doze off."
"Pratyahara is not relaxation, it is an exercise of awareness."
Close your eyes and try to move your body as little as possible for about 10 minutes.
Avoid gossips and negative talks.
Gossip is a bad thing for children. 
"Especially when done with the intention is to say or spread words that are hurtful, damaging to a one's feelings or reputation."
Associate with good friends.
Once there was a fruit seller.
He had a few mangoes in his basket.
"All the mangoes were good, except the one, which was rotten."
"He thought, 'If I leave this rotten mango in the basket full of good mangoes then that rotten mango too would turn to good'."
"So, he left the rotten mango in the basket full of good mangoes."
"However, a week later, when he opened the basket, he was shocked to see that, contrary to his expectation, all the good mangoes had become rotten."
"Keep this point in mind, and always try to remain in the company of good and well-mannered friends."
Observing the nature helps create a sense of wonder in you.
Which you can carry over to other aspects of your life.
Being out in nature helps children to become more aware.
Nature gives you the chance to engage all the senses.
"Enjoy the rising sun, full moon, gaze at the tree, observe the birds, listen to the chirping of the birds etc."
Singing and music play an important role in our culture.
Especially singing and listening to bhajans.
"Right from birth, parents instinctively use music to calm and soothe children, to express love and joy, and to engage and create interaction."
Inculcate a sense of appreciation for Indian classical music. 
"Try to learn Tabla, Sitar, Santoor or Harmonium etc."
These will have a great impact on developing positive aspect of the personality.
Observe your feeling before food and while having food.
"You must be fond of food items such as vada-pav, pav-bhaji, pizzas, chinese food, biscuits, potato chips and cold drinks."
But are you aware of the adverse effects of consuming these items in excess? 
These have a harmful effect on our mind and body.
We think on the basis of whatever we eat and in turn act according to what we think.
Let us understand this with the help of this story.
"Once, a Monk committed a theft at king's palace after having his meal."
The king was shocked at this incident and sought to find out how even a Monk could commit a theft.
"While investigation, he found out that the cook who had prepared that day's meal had committed a theft."
"In this way, the food served, became a medium to pass the bad habit."
"Homemade food is fresh, healthy and easy to digest."
Not only it satisfies our hunger but also provides us with good nutrition.
Wash your hands and legs before eating your lunch.
"Before having food, pray to Kuladevata (Family Deity) or the Upasyadevata (Deity of worship)."
Do not talk in between while having your food.
Have food with a pleasant mind thanking the supreme for the food.
"Finish all the food in your plate, do not waste anything."
"By withdrawing focus from the senses and the external environment, the mind can turn inward ."
"Pratyahara is not relaxation, it is an exercise of awareness."
Nature gives you the chance to engage all the senses.
For Pratyahara close your eyes and try to move your body as little as possible for about 10 minutes.
It is one-pointed concentration.
"It is fixing one' s full attention at one place, object, or idea at a time."
Dharana is the ability to bring the mind into focus and to hold the concentration on a single point.
"In true dharana all body-consciousness and restless thoughts cease, enabling one to focus on the object of meditation without distraction."
"The mind will be free within the periphery of this area, but it should not cross the boundary."
This exercise is known as Dharana.
To understand this definition let us read this story:
A farmer own a calf.
The calf want to roam around in different directions.
"To control the calf from such wandering in different directions, it was not possible to tie it up to a particular point."
So the farmer tie a cord of certain length to its neck and then ties the other end of the cord to a hook in the ground.
"The calf freely moved in the circle, the radius being the length of the cord, but cannot go out of that circle."
Thus the farmer had a control on the calf and also the calf is not at a loss either.
Because it gained a controlled freedom.
This attitude and the idea is important.
"The mind, which is just like the calf wants to roam around everywhere, it is not possible to engage it at a particular point or location."
"Dharana is focusing on a single point which could be - your breath, a mantra, a word, or any object."
"In the beginning, focusing of the mind is difficult."
Therefore a beginner can start meditating for a few minutes only and later on can increase its duration.
Concentration is direction of attention to a single object.
We all have the ability to concentrate.
"Think of the times when you watch movies, play games, it is total concentration."
But at other times your thoughts are scattered.
Your mind jumps from one thing to another.
It's for those time that you need to learn and practice concentration.
"Learning a skill takes practice whether it is dancing, writing, or concentrating."
"The practice of concentration can be developed by performing asanas, breathing practices, pranayama and meditation."
Dharana trains your mind to be attentive and attain aware.
Sitting quietly observing your breath.
"Sitting in Padmasana, close your eyes and observe your inhalation and exhalation."
As you inhale your abdomen bulges out and as you exhale the abdomen sinks.
"Do A-U-M chanting, chanting (A-kara , U-kara, M-kara, A-U-M) in a sequence and focusing on the picture of OM will help you in Dharana or focusing."
Dhyana is a sanskrit word meaning ‘meditation’.
"It is derived from the root words, dhi, meaning ‘receptacle’ or ‘the mind’; and yana, meaning ‘moving’ or ‘going’."
"Unfortunately, the word dhyana is usually translated as meditation, implying a state of calm."
Let us briefly see what dhyana is.
"Earlier to practicing dhyana, the relevant steps of yoga, namely, Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, and Dharana should be practiced."
"It helps you to get rid of negative emotions like fear, anger and develops positive emotions like love, compassion, friendliness and cheerfulness."
Meditation keeps the mind calm and quiet.
"It increases concentration, memory, clarity of thought and will power."
It rejuvenates the body and mind.
"Samadhi is derived from the sanskrit, sam, meaning ‘together with’ ‘completely’ and dha, meaning ‘put’."
It means a complete state of concentration.
"According to system of Patanjali, samadhi is the eighth and final step in the meditative process."
"It is that before the self is released from its self-ignorance and enters the ultimate condition of kaivalya, ‘aloneness’."
"In samadhi, the process of concentration, the object of concentration, and the mind that is trying to concentrate or meditate all become one."
The mind is no longer focusing on the object in an objective manner.
Samadhi is sometimes called self-realization.
Self-realization means getting to know yourself better.
"In the process, you learn to love yourself more."
It's about accepting where you are today at this very moment and moving from a place of honesty.
Tolerance is needed so much in the world today and more so in our own country.
It starts at home in our own mind.
"When we can move from a place of truth and acceptance of ourselves, we can begin to accept and respect others."
Practice Sit in a comfortable position.
Close your eyes and breathe freely through your nose for a few minutes.
Undertake conscious breathing or pranayama .
"Repeat the practice everyday, increase the duration of focused breathing slowly."
"Before you enter a state of samadhi, there is a joy of experiencing stillness."
This effortless state of samadhi is called dharma medha samadhi.
From this emerges an indescribable state of awareness devoid of all desires.
You have studied the basic set of asanas in the previous lesson .
"The ancient rishis of India devised a number of asanas based on their observations of nature - animals, birds etc."
It is not by chance that a whole jungle of animal postures is known in Hatha Yoga terminology.
"Each posture or pose, whether the lion, camel, cat or peacock, has a meaning of its own."
"People who are egoistic, always have their shoulders back and heads up."
"Therefore, every cultural asanas has been designed to build the personality."

1. INTERDEPENDENCE OFORGANISMS
"Everything, organisms and plants are dependent on each other."
They are connected together.
"Nature has made us in a way thathumans, plants, animals and organisms are connected to eachother."
This makes a balance in nature.
If one of them slips out orget separated then the chain gets destroyed.
"For example, you all must have seen an earthworm."
They aremostly found in rainy or moisture land.
Do you know that theyare very helpful in making soil fertile?
They make soil hollowand fertile for agriculture. This helps in high production.
"In thisway, earthworm, soil and crops are related to each other."
We willread about some related components of nature in this lesson.
After reading this chapter you will be able to:
Know about the inter dependence of plants and animals
Explain the balance of nature.
List the causes of natural imbalance.
Tell the correct method of using natural resources
1.1 HOW ARE PLANTS AND ANIMALSCONNECTED TO EACH OTHER
We all know that plants prepare food by the process ofphotosynthesis in the presence of sunlight.
In this way greenplants are dependent on animals.
"On the other hand, animalscannot prepare their own food. They are dependent on plants fortheir food directly or indirectly."
"For example, bees are dependent on flowers to prepare honey."
They get pollen grains flowers and stick from one flower toanother. This process is called pollination.
"In this way, plants getbenefit from bees and bees get benefited from plants for honey."
This is called interdependence.
"In the same way, butterfly andplants are also dependent on each other."
1.2 DEPENDENCE OF ANIMALS ONEACH OTHER
There are many organisms which are dependent on each other.
"For example, some organisms and protozoa present in foodpipe of termites."
These organisms are not the food of termitesbut they are helpful in digesting the wood eaten by termites.
"Inthis way, termites get digestible food and microorganism getfoodand place to live."
Have you seen any bird sitting on buffalo's back or cow's back?
Have you seen them eating something from there? Indeed.
Thesebirds and animals sit and eat small insects.
This helps animals ingetting rid of insects and birds get food too.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 1.1
1. Write the name of any one thing that we get from animals?
2. What does bee get from plants? What does plant get frombee?
1.3 NATURE'S BALANCE
"Every organism needs food to live,"
you know that big animalseat small or less powerful animals by hunting.
In the same way the powerful animals eat animals smaller to them.
This makes achain called food chain.
"Imagine a small jungle (forest) where only plants, deer and lion live."
What will happen if all lions arekilled in the jungle?
This will increase the number of deer inthe jungle.
There will be a time when all the plants will be eatenby the excess population of the deer.
"After plants end, all deerwill too die of hunger."
Note and observe how the excess or shortage of any organismcan harm the natural balance.
This has a bad effect on all theorganisms.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 1.2
1. If all the snakes of the garden are killed then what willhappen?
2. If all the plants of a garden are destroyed then what willhappen?
1.4 NATURAL IMBALANCE
You all must have heard from your parents and elders that ournature is not clean as it used to be.

Who is responsible for this imbalance?
Think about it. Youwill find that humans create situations leading to the imbalanceof the nature.
"For example, you will be shocked to know thathuman cut more trees than he grows in nature."
This leads tothe decrease in the number of trees.
Humans also release harmful chemicals from factories in waterresources daily. This also pollutes water.
Every day factoriesand vehicles emit harmful gases in environment which increases pollution.
Note that man is responsible for increasingpollution.
Interdependence of Organisms
Think what is the basic cause of nature's imbalance?
Themaincause of nature's imbalance is the increasing population of humans.
"Let us understandMore population needs more grains to eat, more clothes to wearand more space to live."
Human cuts forests to produce moregrains establish more factories and build homes.
This causesimbalance in nature.
We need to control the continuous growthof populationto stop the imbalance in nature.
1.5 OPTIMUM OR BEST USE OFNATURAL RESOURCES
Using nature is good but exploiting nature is bad.
We musttake only those things from nature which is necessary for us.
"Generally, plants should be in that number where animals eatenplants"
and new grown plants are equal.
This also applies to bothherbivores and carnivores animals too.
"We get water from many sources like river,falls, ponds and rainor underground reserves. We use water forirrigation of plants."
Underground water means water availableafter digging the earth.
Have you ever thought that where does underground water comes from?
A part of rain water is absorbedby earth. Water collected under the earth is called undergroundwater.
If the rate of using this water is different from the rate of collection then underground water level will go down.
Asituation will come where we will not get a drop of water fromunderground.
"Think if there will be no water, will there be life?"

USEFUL PRODUCTS FOR US
"Wherever you live whether city or village you have seen manyobjects around you,"
"many things like utensils, clothes, books,toys, chair, table, cycle, car, telephone etc are daily use items."
Ifthese things are not available then what will be our life?
All thesethings have become an important part of our life. We cannotimagine our life without them.
But these things are not availableto us at one go.
Although humans used to wear animal skin andeat raw fruits and vegetables. He used to live in caves. Now thelife has completely changed into a comfortable one. It tookthousands of years to happen.
"During this long journey humanlearnt to use the natural object from his surroundings. He alsodiscovered new objects,"
various types of metals are found inIndia from Vedic times.
"These range from agricultural equipments,construction tools or weapons. Many examples of using metalsand other objects can be seen."
Let us learn about the daily use of some elements in this lesson.
"After reading this lesson, you will be able to:"
Understand the need of aluminum and copper wires inelectricity;
Tell the reason for naming an age of human civilization asmetallic age;
Explain the process of colouring glasses and making types ofglasses;
Explain the reason for non-foaming of soap in hard water;
Describe the effect of polythene and
Importance of fertilizers and pesticides.
2.1 OUR NEEDS
Necessity is the mother of invention
"Food, shelter, clothing,transport and communication are our basic needs."
We need manyobjects to fulfill our need.
"For example, we use utensils to cook,store and serve food products."
"Utensils are made up of manyobjects- examples- metals, glass or clay (bone china) and now adays we use non-stick, plastic and products of other utensils."
"Ifwe discuss regarding clothes, we find many beautiful dressesmade up of cotton, woolen, silk, nylon, polyester etc."
"In the same way soil, brick, cement, wood, mortar, glass,aluminum and other materials are made to build houses."
Iron netand grill etc is used to make windows and doors.
"Maximum furniture is made up of woods but now a daysfurniture made up of plastic steel, can, iron etc."
"Many usefulitems like watch, pen, telephone, fridge, t.v., car etc are made upof many modern particles."
All these things were our need and wewere motivated to develop many kinds of objects from theseelements.
2.2 MINERALS
We have been using metals since ages.
"The use of metals hasbeen very important for human life that many civilizations havebeen named after metals like Iron Age, copper age etc."
Many objects are made up of many type of elements.
Have youever thought where these metals came from?
Some metals arefound naturally in mountains where as some are prepared byhumans in factories.
Minerals available in nature have been classified into twocategories- metallic and non-metallic.
We get metals from metallicminerals. These are also known as mineral ores.
"89 types ofminerals are found in India, out of which 11 are metallic, 52non-metallic, 4 fuel minerals and 22 other minerals."
Let us know about metal minerals.
Those minerals from whichmetals can be extracted easily are called metal ores.
"Some of the important minerals are iron, copper, aluminum,manganese and gold."
"In the same way, many non-metallic andminerals are also found in India,"
"these are mica, gypsum,limestone, dolomite and asbestos."
2.3 METALS AND NON-METALS
Now identify the things given in the figure 1.1 and classify whichare made up of metals and non-metals.
Some of these objects are made up of metals and some are madeup of other objects.
"For example, knife, spoon, nail-bolt, keylock etc are made up of metal"
"where as rope, shoes etc are madeup of plastic or leather"
and Chakla-belan by wood.
"Pots aremade up of mud,"
"bottle, glass, bucket etc can be made from plastic."
Let us know more about metals.
Properties of metals
Whatever we have said about metals is based on our dailyexperience and knowledge.
Many metal elements can beseparated from each other on the basis of physical qualities.
Thesephysical characteristics are used to identify metals.
(A) Physical Properties
1. metals are shiny and they have a special metal lustre.
"2. metals are hard but sodium, magnesium are exceptions, thesecan be cut easily by a knife."
3. metals can be made into thin sheet.
Aluminum polythene isused to wrap chocolates and medicines; it is also used to keepthe food fresh and warm.
4. Metals are ductile.
metal wires are good conductor of electricity.
Wires can bemade from aluminum and copper.
5. metals are good conductors of heat.
These are used in thecooking food utensils.
"6. metals are hard and strong, these are used to constructbuildings, trains, vehicles, instruments and bridge etc."
Non-metals are different from metals. They don't have physicalproperties of metals.
"Some examples of non-metals are- nitrogen, chlorine and oxygen gases, carbon, silicon etc."
let us know whatthe chemical properties of metals are.
(B) chemical properties
"Chemical properties of metals include reactions with air, waterand acid."
"Some metals like sodium potassium, aluminum, copper,iron etc are more reactive whereas gold, platinum etc are lessreactive."
"These metals are found in free form on earth. Therefore,they are less reactive."
"Due to reactive properties, oxide, sulphidesand carbonates etc are found in compound form."
"Other than pure metals, mixture of metals are also used."
Theseare known as alloy.
Let us get more knowledge related to it.
Alloy
Alloys are compounded and homogenous mixtures and areprepared by melting of metals.
Some properties of alloy aredifferent from metals.
For example- Brass is composed of copperand yon metals.
Tin is strong and corrosion resistant but copperis a soft metal.
"In the same way, iron gets rust easily."
"However,when mixed with carbon produces steel mixed metal."
"When iron,carbon, chromium and nickel mix together, then they formstainless steel."
"These mixed alloys are strong, tough and does notget rust. This form of metals are used in many ways."
some of thecommon alloy are-
Let us now learn about human made elements after metals andtheir uses which were discussed in the beginning of the lesson.
"This includes cement used for construction, glass, soap,detergents, polymer, fertilizers and pesticides."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 2.1
1. Aluminum is found as _____ ore.
2. _____ metal can be cut easily from knife.
3. Limestone is found in _____ and _____ states.
4. Write the names of any three maximum reactiove metals?
5. What is ductility?
2.4 MATERIALS USED IN CONSTRUCTION
"Construction of home, bridges, roads and dams use naturalstone wood, metals and bricks, lime, cement, concrete etc."
"Naturalstones like granite, marble and sand stone are also used."
"Thesematerials have been used in the construction of nagarjunsagar dam. Tajmahal, vridheshwar temple and Lal Qila ofDelhi."
"Indian sculpture is world famous for its monumentalheritage on stone and building vast temples,"
we have seen makingbig temples by joining pieces of stone without mortar in earliertimes
these stones are used now a days in homes and buildingsin cities.
these stones are used now a days in homes and buildingsin cities.
Earlier it was used to join stones and bricks.
Afterwards bitumenand lime began to be used.
"However, Portland cement wasinvented in the 19th century."
"Now cement is used in constructinghomes, buildings, bridges etc."
let us read about cement.
Cement
Portland cement was discovered by Joseph Espidy in 1824.
Hemixed limestone and loamy soil to make a powerful waterresistant material. The colour of this material looked like thelime stone of Portland.
"Therefore, the material was called Portlandcement."
"Modern Portland cement has 60-70% calcium oxide, 17- 25% silica, 3-8% aluminum oxide and up to 6% iron oxide;"
Limestone and loamy soil is mixed as per desired ratio.
This is heatedin a rotary kiln at the temperature of 1150 Kelvin.
The materialis called clinker.
"When powdered gypsum is mixed with thismaterial, cement is produced."
"The plastering material is prepared by mixing sand, cement andwater"
to hold brick and stones. It is also used for plastering.
"Concrete is formed by mixing sand, soil and water in cement."
"This is used in corners of road and middle pathways, roofs ofhomes and electricity poles etc."
2.5 SOAP AND DETERGENT
"Many soaps and detergents are available in the market for bathing, washing and cleaning."
They are made attractive by adding colorsand smell.
Soaps are prepared by the chemical reaction of fat of sodiumhydroxide with oils available in natural form.
Natural oils areobtained from fats of oily organisms and seeds from plants.
Someexamples of oils are - palm oil and olive oil.
Esters present inoils get decomposed by water with sodium hydroxide. We getacid present in aster with sodium salt and glycerol.
This way we find that sodium salt of acids are soaps.
When soaps are used in hard water then foam is not built.
"Ithappens because hard water has soluble calcium and magnesiumsalt, these react with soap to form non dissolve particles."
But this thing doesn't happen with detergents
they produce foamseven in hard water
because they do not form non dissolve particleswith calcium and magnesium salt.
Let us now understand how soap and detergents are a part ofcleaning process.
Many detergents are available in market now days. Some of themare biodegradable
but not all.
Bio degradable meansdecomposition can be done by micro organisms like bacteria andworms.
Those non biodegradable particles flow in rivers andother water resources and pollute them. This water is harmfulfor both water plants and water animals.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 2.2
1. What is the difference between soap and detergent?
2. How are detergents harmful for environment?
2.7 FERTILIZERS AND PESTICIDES
Fertilizers and pesticides are used largely to fulfill the food needsof the growing population of the world.
Let us first read aboutfertilizers.
Fertilizers
Fertilizers are used to increase the production capacity of theland.
They help plants in getting proper nutrition and high yield.
Fertilizers improve the following elements in plants.
1. Nitrogen - nitrogen is useful for development in pants andprotein synthesis.
This dissolves in water and reached plantsafter getting absorbed in roots by water.
2. Phosphorus - this is essential for development of roots ofplants.
We get it from phosphorous mountains.
3. Potassium - this element is important for the production offruits on plants.
This is used as potassium sulphate.
Watersoluble 'super phospate' and 'triple super phospate' etc areobtained by grinding mountains and its reaction with sulphuricacid.
Regular use of chemical fertilizers is harmful for nature.
Thisincreases pollution and affects the fertility of the soil.
It is alsoharmful for human health.
"This is the reason behind the increasinguse of fertilizers like compost, vermin compost etc."
Pesticides are those elements which stop the growth of unwantedplants and organisms.
These unwanted plants and organisms areharmful for both plants and humans.
Pesticides are of many kinds
and can be divided into many categories on the basis of how the bacterial growth is stopped bythem.
"These categories are - Bacteria pesticides, fungicide, weed cutting, insecticides andweed pesticides."
These pesticides protect humans and plants from many diseases
and benefit their health.
Pesticides have been used for centuries
"around 2000 years ago Arsenic andits compound were used as pesticides for the first time,"
they wereused till the mid of last century.
Some carbonic pesticides werediscovered during World War II. There were more effective thana carbonic pesticide like arsenic.
This can stop insect developmentfrom a small amount and they are less harmful from otherorganisms and plants.
You all must have hard about D.D.T.
this was invented in 1939.
It was used massively in Second World War
to stop the growthof mosquitoes responsible for spreading malaria.
They were soaffected by that that the use of D.D.T. increased day by day.
Slowly and gradually insects and mosquitoes became resistantto D.D.T. and they did not show any effect.
This was also saidthat D.D.T. remains in soil for many years and does not getdecomposed. It reaches food chain and is harmful for otherorganisms and humans.
After this information some countries banned D.D.T.
Chemical elements are chemical products and should be usedvery less because they pollute our environment.
We must useour resources judiciously and lessen our needs to save pollutionin environment.
Many biological organic pesticides like til oil isused in present time.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 2.3
1. Why are pesticides and fertilizers used?
2. What does plant get from fertilizers?
3. Give two examples of pesticides?
Our needs have motivated us to use available natural resourcesand making new products.
Metals are found in minerals and have special physical andchemical properties.
Alloy has different properties from metals and has betterproperties than metals.

"2. Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium etc."
"3. D.D.T., B.H.C., Pararthylone, Methylone etc (any two)"
ORGANISM DEVELOPMENT
We have seen many changes around us.
Many changes can beseen with visible eye and we can feel them.
There are somechanges that we cannot see easily with our eyes .
These changes brought about the development of organisms.
Manyspecies of organisms are born on earth.
"These changes take along time than a human life to be seen. Therefore, humans cannotsee the sequence of development of these changes."
But scientistshave collected many proofs and facts to prove these changes.
Many types of organisms and their species (some of them arealive) and some of them have evolved through organicdevelopment.
"Close your eyes and think about many living objects. Manyorganisms will come in front of you. Some of the commonelements will be plants, animals and birds."
Do you know thatbacteria converts milk into curd or cause diseases like T.B. arealso living organisms.
Even eatable mushroom is also an example.
Scientists have estimated that around 1 crore species or organismsare developed on earth.
Scientists have the knowledge of around 20 lakh organisms.
All these organisms living together and forma balance.
The balance of all these organisms is called biodiversity.
"Due to the growth of biological development, biologicaldiversity is found on earth."
We will study the process of development of life on earth in thislesson.
After reading this lesson you will be able to:
Tell about the time and the process of earth formation
Tell about the time of earth's development and the presentposition of atmosphere ;
Tell how dinosaur type organisms got extinct ;
Tell the sequence of human development
3.1 DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE
Development means change.
Development is the changes fromwhich new species of organisms are developed.
New speciestake time to develop.
The situations of earth are constantlychanging. These changes are necessary with the situations.
"Therefore, it is necessary to adapt with these changes."
The specieswhich are unable to coordinate with these changes die
"and getextinct, for example - dinosaur. All new species originate fromtheir predecessors."
Charles Darwin (1809-1822) was a great scientist.
He collectedmany logics and said two important things for development.
1. All the specie organisms originate from the developmentprocess.
2. All the process of biological development is called naturalselection of spices.
This means that all natural organisms choose and reproduce suchorganisms that are adaptable to environment.
"This explains that when environmental situations changethen the original generation makes new species,"
"this is the reasonwhen with time many new species originate,"
"this includes manytype of organisms like bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plants, animalsand humans,"
"these species have many common things, likebreathe in one way or another doing activities like getting nutritionetc."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 3.1
1. Name the scientist who is called the 'father of biologicaldevelopment' ?
2. Name any two common process which are essential to livefor every organism?
3.2 DEVELOPMENT OF ONE LIVING CELLORGANISM TO MULTI CELL ORGANISM
You have seen that the physical conditions of earth are changingand this has lead to many developmental changes in organisms.
Now we will study how situations change on earth and who wasthe first being that evolved.
There were many changes in thedevelopment process which has lead to the development of manyspecies and organisms.
The process of development for biologicalprocess is considered to be natural selection.
"You will be surprised to know that earth was not there before 5billion years,"
slowly- slowly natural changes came into placeand earth became around 4-5 billion years ago.
You will also besurprised to know that Indian Vedic scriptures also believe thedevelopment of earth by that time.
There are many stages ofdevelopment which are given below.
"First stage: there was no water on earth,"
clouds only thundered.
"However, slowly temperature declines, started raining and waterwas collected on earth."
There was no organism till date.
Second stage: first of all very small micro organisms evolved inwater.
These are the predecessors of every organism now days.
"There one branch of bacteria is also seen today,"
there was noopen oxygen in atmosphere in this stage.
Third stage: single cell organisms went through many changesand the process of photo synthesis became possible.
Oxygenincreased in atmosphere. Many kinds of organisms took birth.
After micro organisms Algae came into existence which isfound in ponds and single cell protozoa were also born.
"Dueto development of changes in single cell predecessor, manysingle cell organisms like fungi, plants and humans were alsodeveloped."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 3.2
1. Who were the first organisms to evolve?
2. A group of organisms is given below.
Write them in ascendingorder of their development:
"Plants, fungi, animals, bacteria, algae and protozoa"
3. Name the life giving gas which was not present in atmospherein early days?
4. Who evolved first- plants or animal
3.3 DINOSAURS AND THEIR EXTINCTION
"Changes in development process are not seen in common,"
but many facts suggest that organisms have evolved fromdevelopment.
Fossils are also such facts.
Fossils are theremains of those organisms which were present on earthbefore.
These are found after digging mountains or stones. Thebodies of many organisms take the shape of stone after a timeperiod.
Many huge dinosaurs used to live on earth around 15 crore yearsago.
There was no bird or mammals on earth at that time.
Many fossils of dinosaurs have been found after digging of earth.
They belong to reptiles group of animals.
"Now a days lizard,snakes, tortoise and crocodile come in this category."
A figure is given below;
you can imagine the big body ofdinosaurs from this picture.
"There were many species of dinosaurs,"
"some use to live in water, some could fly in air andsome could walk on land."
Dinosaurs used to rile earth 230lakh year ago to 65 lakh years ago.
You could see themeverywhere at that time.
Some used to eat plants and some werecarnivores.
A big lizard is found in Comodo Island in Pacific Ocean andrepresents dinosaur.
It is called Commodo Dragon.
"Dinosaurs were living a happy life on earth at that time,"
slowlythe environment on earth changed.
Some scientists believe thatdue to spreading of a specific radiation all dinosaurs dies andgot extinct.
Dinosaur is a good example to learn aboutdevelopment.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 3.3
1. Name any two animals which are found now days and belongto dinosaur category of animals?
2. What are fossils?
3. Write one cause for the extinction of dinosaurs?
3.4 DEVELOPMENT IS STILL GOING
Humans evolved on earth around 20 lakh years back.
Humanshave many ancient features
but it is most complex and high levelof development that took place
because of maximumdevelopment of human mind.
"Human body is going throughchange but these changes are very micro,"
human development isgoing and still is going.
Humans are considered similar to ape (like chimpanzee).
Every organism of the earth is going through changes.
"Forexample, India suffered form malaria in the decade of 1950."
The species of mosquito spreading malaria was destroyed byD.D.T.
but soon it was known that many mosquitoes could notdie in presence of D.D.T.
They had undergone natural selectionand the number of such resistant mosquitoes increased fromgeneration to generation.
Development not only means makingnew species but also the development of new symptoms in anyspecies.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 3.4
1. Is development still happening in the world?
2. Our country had controlled malaria completely but why it ishappening again now?
3. What do you mean by development?
Biological diversity is the result of developmental changewhich leads to the evolvement of new species.
There are many development changes which cannot be seenbut many can prove it.
Fossil is an example.
Development changes happen because of the situations onearth and some organisms could not face these changes. Theydie or get extinct
where in some organisms adapt to changessituation and can live.
Charles Darwin (1809-1822) believes that all organisms gavea common development.
He gave natural selection for thedevelopment process.
Earth evolved before 4 to 5 billion years ago. The situationson earth were not according to life at that time.
Soon Earth's atmosphere had Oxygen.
Single cell organisms like protozoa came.
"Multi cell fungi, plants and organisms evolved one after theother."
The structure of organism was simple in beginning but becamecomplex later on.
Many species of dinosaurs were present on earth at a time.
Humans developed at the last stage of development familyof organisms.
"Nature is developing regularly, D.D.T resistant mosquitoesis a good example of this."

3. Dinosaurs extinct after changes on earth.
"3.4-- 1. Yes, now a days"
"2. Mosquitoes became resistant to D.D.T. therefore, thishappened."
"2. Mosquitoes became resistant to D.D.T. therefore, thishappened."
LIVING WORLD ANDDIVERSITY
Look around you.
"You will find many things like table, chair,toys, mobile, TV etc."
"when you will see walls and rooms, youwill find mosquitoes, flies, lizard and cockroach."
"If you lookoutside your house, you will find birds, animals, cow, buffalo,cat, dogs etc moving"
"and different plants in statue mode likeneem, jamun, aam, amrood or grass grown on land or wheat-mustard in farm."
"If you look in sky, you will find birds, airplanesetc."
if you make a list of things then things will be a long list.
"All these objects can be classified into three categories- living,non-living and dead."
You will be surprised to know that plantsare loving beings.
It is also an honour that this was told to theworld by an Indian scientist Sh. Jagdish Chandra Bose.
IndianVedic scriptures have always considered plants as a living beingand have always tried to protect it.
"Table- chair components likewood, bines or horns etc separates form animals are dead becausethey were a part of living body once and mirror, soil, water, stone, iron, nail etc are non-living things, they never had any life"
let usknow the difference between living and non-living.
How arelining things different from non-loving things?
How are livingthings similar to non-living things.
Let us know about them.
"After learning this chapter, you will be able to:"
Tell the difference between living and non-living objects.
Explain the characteristics of living things
Describe the breathing process and food production for living organisms
Explain the importance of living and non-living things
4.1 LIVING OBJECTS AND THEIRCHARACTISTICS
Sometimes you can find the living and non living things bytouching.
But can you tell the characteristics of living and non-living things that make a difference.
Let us see on what basis anobject is considered live.
"Basically, there are 9 characteristics ofliving things:"
(1) Growth (development of body)
(2) Cellular body structure
(3) Dynamics
(4) Nutrition
(5) Breathing
(6) Excretion; taking out wastes
(7) Reaction
(8) Reproduction
(9) A fixed life and death
Let us learn something about them.
1. Growth in living organisms
Every living organism is small at the time of birth.
It growseventually.
A small calf becomes an ox.
"Mango seed gives birthto a small plant which becomes a tree,"
you yourself were a smallkid
now you are getting developed
and will develop till youbecome a man or woman.
"This development increases your bones,muscles and blood quantity."
"Non living things don't do these activities,"
they do not breatheand do not make new things.
After getting full development of the body some growth maintainsbody parts.
"If you get a cut then new skin comes and fills thewound,"
nails also increase. This is also a growth.
"Have you ever seen any growth un cycle, glass or pencil?"
"No,because all these things are non-living things."
2. Living things are made up of cell
Every living being or plant and their body are made up ofmicroorganism cell.
These are so small that they can only beseen with the help of microscope.
Every cell has a livingstructrure; many activities are done in this living structure.
"Mostof the growth in living objects is due to the increase in the numberif cells,"
new cells are formed with the help of old cells.
"You must be thinking that new cells make a human being asbricks join to form the wall, but brick is a part of wall."
One brickcannot make another brick.
Brick is a non living thing where ascell is a living being.
Let us know important things about cell:
Every living organism has a different cell.
"Some organism aremade up of one cell like bacteria, amoeba etc,"
these are knownas single cell animals.
Many other organisms are made up of multi cells
"like flies, humans, elephant, horse etc."
These are known asmulti cell organisms.
The big the organism - the more cells
"cat has more cells thanmouse, cow has more cell than cats and elephants have morecell than cows."
Banana plant has more cell than rose plants or guava trees.
Banyan tree has more cells than banana plants.
3. Dynamism
Every microorganism moves.
"Everyone has his own pace forwalking like horse, cow insects, birds etc."
we can move manyparts of our body.
"Plants also have mobility,"
"they move whilestanding at one place,"
sunflower moves in the direction of thesun.
Leaves move towards light.
Roots move towards water.
Allthese movements are from inside of the organism. Thesemovements are not outside the body.
Leaves of some trees getclose in the night and open during the day.
Sensitive plants getdown when touched and becomes straight after some time.
Can a cycle move on its own?
Watches move by cell or settingfriction. They do not move by their own.
Power to move is given to them fromoutside.
4. Food is needed by living organisms
Every organism needs food.
"If you are kept hungry for sometime, you will feel weakness."
"Whatever food you eat gives yougrowth. This growth is seen in bones, muscles or blood in yourbody."
"If an organism does not get food for a longer period oftime, he will become weak and die soon."
Plants make their ownfood.
Some animals eat the plants or parts of plants. Some animalsare carnivores -
they eat those animals who become big aftereating plants.
Have you ever thought what the food of green plants is?
"Theymake their food from soil, water and carbon dioxide in presenceof air and sunlight,"
"if any one thins is missing, they die."
Does your cycle or book need food?
"No, they don't have growthand they don't have power to move."
5. Breathing in living things (energy generation by the use ofoxygen)
We breathe (inhale or exhale) from day to night.
Maximumorganism inhale air and exhale it.
Animals living in water likefish keeps inhaling water and exhaling it.
"They absorb oxygenmixed in water,"
this oxygen in form of air or water is used by cellas a powerful energy building.
They do their own work fromless energy.
During this time carbon dioxide is formed in bodyand is exhaled by cells.
Breathing activities are similar in plants and organisms.
Plants take oxygen inside with the help of smallpores in their leaves and stem.
"In this way, human take oxygeninside breathing practices and exhale carbon dioxide."
6. Excretion (taking out wastes by living organisms)
The body of living organisms makes water products due to theresult of physical activities which are toxic. It is essential to takethem out from human body.
The urine of organisms also haswaste products other than water.
Some of the toxic elements thatcome out of body are sweating.
"Some examples of excretion aregums firm plants, falling and drying of old leaves from plantsetc."
"Non living things like table, chairs etc neither breather nor giveout any excrete materials."
7. Reaction by living objects
"Whenever your hand touches a fork or unknowingly you touch ahot utensil, then you instantly take your hand back."
Any situationrelated to pricking or touching hot objects by which a body reactsis called stimulation
and the action to that stimulate is calledreaction.
Many situation of same kind happens in every livingorganism.
Many situation of same kind happens in every livingorganism.
"Stimulation always happens againsttemperature, light, sound, touch and chemicals."
"Think about one thing, some time you smell tasty food andwater comes in your mouth,"
will you call it a reaction orstimulation?
8. Reproduction or giving birth to a child
Every living organism gives birth to a new generation or child.
Cow gives birth to calf.
Birds lay eggs by which their childrencome out.
"Frog and fish also lay eggs,"
if any specie does notreproduce then that species comes to an end.
Seeds grow fromplants and these seeds make new plants from roots or branches.
Simplest single cell organism like bacteria or amoeba alsoreproduces from one method or the another.
Does any non living thing make an object same to itself?
"No,"
abrick cannot make a second brick.
If you break a brick frombetween then there will be two small bricks but they cannotincrease to get normal size.
It is the same way that a cycle cannot make another cycle
and a chair cannot give birth to another chairetc.
9. There is a fixed life of the living organisms.
"Every living thing is born and it grows in size and gets old incompleting the activities of life, it dies afterwards."
"Differentorganisms have different life expectancy,"
some have less life andsome have big life.
Here we present some of the examples of lifetenure:
Bacteria - around 20 minutes
Mouse - around 2-3 years
Dog - around 12-14 years
Human - around 70-80 years
Banyan tree - around 200 years
Tortoise - around 400 years
Sequoya tree - around 3000-4000 years
"There is no life expectancy of non-living things,"
"for example, aglass can live forever or can break any minute."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 4.1

5. Sunflower keeps changing the direction according to thedirection of sun.
6. Water and energy is produced during breathing.
7. Every living object reacts towards stimulants.
8. Every living object has a fixed life and they die afterwards.
4.2 DIVERSITY OF LIVEING ORGANISMS
There are thousand and lakhs of living organism on earth.
Theyare from big to small and micro small in size.
"Their colour andformation is different too,"
some give children and some lay eggs.
"Some organism like amoeba or bacteria reproduces by divinginto two parts,"
some fly in the air and some jump from one treeto another tree.
Some crawl deep in ocean. Some animals crawlin desert
and some other organisms move inside other organismsbody.
We see the diversity in animals.
4.3 CLASSIFICATIONS OF LIVINGORGANISMS
Living organisms are very much found in population. They havedifferent colours and form. It has been categorized into manycategories on the basis of similarities.
Basically living organisms are categorized into two categories -plants and organisms.
Let us know more about them.
1. Plants are fixed in land and have the leaves of green or anothercolours.
2. Organisms can move from one place to another and eat otherorganisms or plants.
"3. The third category belongs to those who are not green colourplants and not moving organism,"
one of the example is whitecoloured fungi which loves on food items or mushroom grownfor food or dirty place grown mushroom.
4. The fourth category is of micro organism which have onecell body
"like algae, green coloured thread like structure in apond or amoeba living in dirty water."
5. Fifth category has a single cell bacteria or micro organism.Lakhs of bacteria can live in a needle's tip.
"Organism are being classified from old times,"
this classificationwas started by Carl Linius in 1735 in modern science.
Butnow days these are classified into five types with some changes.
They have been placed from simple to complex in the followingmanner -
"1. Monera kingdom- bacteria, virus etc."
"2. Protista Kingdom- Algae, Amoeba, etc."
"3. Fungi - Fungi kingdom -fungus, mushroom etc."
"4. Plantae Kingdom- plant kingdom - all plants likeneem, mango, rose, marigold etc."
"5. Animalia kingdom - allorganism like dog, monkey, cat,lice, bird, humans etc."

STRUCTURE OF LIVINGWORLD
Many kinds of organisms are found around us.
Living objectsare different from non-living objects.
"A big difference is foundin the shape, size and living place of living organisms."
Thesedifferences become the basis of their division or categories.
Wehave read about them in previous lesson.
You know some organisms are very small and they cannotbe seen with naked eye.
Some of the organisms are big likeelephant and whale which are seen from a distance.
Someorganisms are helpful for us and they give useful product too.
There are many other organisms which harm us.
Therefore toknow the basic structure of these organisms is beneficial to us.
Let us try to know more about them.
After reading this lesson you will be able to:
Tell the names of most simple and smaller organism onearth
"Describe the similarities found in plants, humans and theirorgans"
Explain the breathing process and nutrition system of plants
Explain the various types of plants and parts of flowers withtheir importance
5.1 BACTERIA-SMALLEST ORGANISMS
Bacteria are the simplest and smallest organisms found on earth.
"They are found in almost every place like air, water, soil andeven inside our body."
Their body is made up of single cell
andsize is from 0.2 to 100 microns (1 micron = 1/1000 millimeter).
The central element is not covered by any membrane in the cellsof bacteria.
There is a cell wall or membrane outside the cell.
Bacteria are mostly divided into three shapes-
1. long shape bacteria
2. circular
3. serpentine (lymph) bacteria - curvy like snakes
Bacteria have their own importance.
Some bacteria are helpfuland some are harmful.
Benefits and disadvantages of bacteria
(a) Benefits from bacteria
1. Decomposition of dead - many organisms die every day.
Theydecompose dead bodies and leave in nature.
Thisdecomposition is reused by plants.
2. Manure making in soil - bacteria found in soil from chemicalslike ammonia and nitrate which are useful for plants.
"3. Merge with plants - some bacteria merge with plants to changenitrogen to nitrate and give natural manure to the plants. Somespecial plants are - peas, pulses, beans etc."
"4. Cleaning water - some bacteria clean water by decomposingdust, dirt and flowing waste in water."
"5. Source of digestion - some bacteria live in the food pipe ofcows, goats, flies or some insects etc. they help in the digestionof cellulose (a part of the eaten plant)."
6. Food industries- some bacteria are used in food industries toform some of the food items
like lactobacillus which help inthe preparation of curd from milk.
Vinegar is also preparedby the activities of bacteria.
7. Sources of medicines - many antibiotic medicines increasethe immunity power in body. Immunity power helps infighting the diseases. Some medicines are prepared by variousbacteria.
Some vitamins and hormones are prepared with thehelp of bacteria.
(b) Harmful bacteria
1. cause of many diseases - many bacteria cause diseases
"liketuberculosis, dysentery, tetanus, whooping cough etc."
2. Destroys food - any food items are destroyed by bacteria.
"For example - milk,"
"fruits, vegetables etc get rotten bybacteria."
5.2 ALGAE LOOK LIKE PLANTS BUTARE NOT PLANTS
Algae are simple organism which looks like plants.
They have acell membrane and chlorophyll.
They can be single cell or multicell.
"They don't have stem or leaves,"
these are mostly found inwater or wet places.
Algae make a green surface on wet landwhich is slippery.
Green -green thread like organisms swim onthe surface of the pond are also a type of algae.
Algae are a microscopic organism which ranges from single cell to manymeter long cells. Even ocean algae is also a type of algae
someplaces have red algae too.
Algae- useful and harmful
Useful:
1. Some algae are the food of the fishes and water organisms.
2. Some special algae are used to increase the thickness of somespecial ice creams and jelly.
3. Algae makes food by photosynthesis ad gives our oxygen innature
which is inhaled by other organisms.
4. Some algae are used in industries.
5. These are also used as manures.
Harmful:
1. Some algae which grow in ponds are harmful for otherorganisms.
2. Algae born in water tanks make water unsuitable fordrinking.
5.3 PROTOZOA (ORGANISMS LIKE AMOEBA)
Protozoa is a single cell organism
which has specific characteristicfor organisms.
These can move from one place to another.
They can catch their food and eat it.
Amoeba is an exampleof protozoa.
This is found on pond water or in dirty water.
This organism can expand its cell is calledPseudopodia.This organism can move from one place to another.
This helps them in catching their food.
There are 1000 speciesof protozoa.
Some protozoa bore diseases
like parasites ofmalaria which causes disease in our red blood cells after reachingthem.
Fungus (fungi like organisms)
Fungi look like plants but they don'thave chlorophyll.
Two types ofcommon fungi are fungi found onbread or fruits and fungi foundon mushrooms or dirty and moistplaces.
Fungi cannot make their ownfood
but they absorb the juice of therotten things where they are born.
These are single cell organisms (example- feast) and multi-cell(example-mushroom)
"and basically grow in dark, lukewarm andwet place."
Most of the fungi are harmful but some mushrooms make tastyfood.
Useful and harmful:
Useful
1. Some fungi is uses to make food and liquid objects.
Yeastmakes bread.
"Khammer is used to make idli, dosa etc."
2. Some mushrooms are eaten
but most of the mushrooms arepoisonous.
3. Some of the fungi are used to make penicillin or vitamin b.
4. Fungi decompose dead plants and elements in nature. Theyhelp in the circle of elements.
Harmful
1. Some fungi give disease like irritation or rings.
2. Some fungi harm wheat or barley.

5.4 PLANTS
Look around you. You will find three types of plants
"1. Grass - grass and grass related plants are mostly seasonal likecarrot, radish etc.,"
"2. Shrubs - some plants stem come out as branchon earth and live for many years Like rose, hibiscus etc.,"
3. tree- a thick and long bark of wood which has many branches
"likeneem, mango, banyan etc."
There are two important organ system of every plant
- root systemand shoot system.
Let us know about the parts of plant.
"Forexample, we take mustard plant."
The basic structure of very plantis almost the same;
"the difference will be of colour, form, shapeof leaves, colour of flowers and shapes of fruits etc."
If there have been no green plants then humans and animalscannot live.
Plants make their own food with sunlight.
Let us see the tip to root part with the help of a mustard plant.
Parts of plant
1. Root system- this is the part below the land.
2. Primary root - comparatively the thicker part in the mid of theplant.
3. Secondary roots - these are numerous thin roots coming outof primary root.
They absorb water and mineral salts fromsoil to the plants.
(a) Root system
"Seeds are sown in soil. First of all, parts related to roots comeout in plants."
The primary roots provide water and mineral toplants.
They are divided into two parts.
There are four main characteristics of roots:
1. Roots always grow below the soil
2. They always move towards water.
3. Roots always move away from the light.
4. Roots don't have green colour.
There are two important works of roots:
1. Fixing plant - they make plant stable and straight on land.
2. absorb - they absorb water and mineral salt from soil andprovide nutrition to plants.
Roots do many other works in special plants
"- they store food insome plants like carrot, radish, turnip, beetroot, sweet potatoetc."
some new plants also grow from the roots of other plants.Example - dahlia.
(b) shoot system - part of the plant above the soil
1. stem - it is that part of plant which is above the soil.
"2. Stamen - this is the part of plant above the soil havingbranches, leaves, fruits and flowers."
3. bark/trunk: the middle part between two stamens.
4. leaves: these are thin and sharp mostly green coloured partfrom where plants prepare their own food.
5. flower: part of plant which is most colourful.
6. fruit: this part is developed in fruit
and many new plants growfrom there.
Let us know more about these
stem or trunk.
Part of the plant above soil is called stem or trunk.
This is themost important part of shoot system
"with stamen, buds, leavesetc."
Most of smaller parts have soft and green stem
which moveeasily.
Shrubs and trees have stem or trunk method made up oftough and hard wood.
The outer surface of wooden stem hasbark.
Functions of stem:
"1. Gives support: trunk supports branches, leaves, fruits andflowers."
2. Carrying- they carry absorbed water and mineral salts to leaves.
3. Storage of food- they transport food prepared by leaves to thestem or trunk of the plants.
"4. Some of the plants transform, their bud into long green leaveslike structure, thework of these leaves like structure is to dothe work of photosynthesis. Example- nagfni, cactus etc."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 5.2
A) State whether the following statements are true or false:
1. Stamen is that part of stem from where leaves fall out.
2. Primary roots are developed from seedlings or seeds.
3. Turnip is a transformed trunk.
4. Green stems like nagfani's stem can prepares their foodusing stems.
b. leaves
Leaves are green colored thin and long structure from stem.
Thispart of plant has different shapes.
Leaves make food for plants.This process is called photosynthesis.
Functions of leaves
1. Light (mostly sunlight) is required by the plants with carbondioxide and water to prepare their own food.
2. Extra water on leaves depict the water inside the plants whichget out in form of steam and small holes (stomata) in leaves.
3. Plants take oxygen present in the air inside with the help ofleaves.
c. flower
Flower are also present in the stem of the plant.
Flowers are thereproductive organ of plants.
Functions of flower
1. Reproduction - the main function of flower in nature isreproduction.
Fruit is made inside the flower seeds. Seeds arealso built in flowers from where new plant grows.
2. Smell and beauty: flowers are beautiful and have a good smell.They also take part in reproduction.
They attract insects andbirds to sit on;
they suck juice from flowers and pollenstick to their bodies.
The pollen grains falls in other flowerswhen they go and sit on them.
This leads to the starting offruit from flowers.
Importance of flowers for humans
1. Fruits are made from flowers which we eat.
2. flowers look beautiful in garden and at homes
3. People give each other flowers as a mark of respect. Example- gajra or garland.
Flowers are also used in prayer for godsand goddesses.
4. Bees make honey from flowers which we eat.
5. Scent is also prepared from flowers.
6. Clove is a flower which is used as spices and medicine.
Parts of flowers
A common flower when cut from between can be seen like this:
1. Bud - that part on which flowers are kept.
2. Anther - that part of bud which is open and has petals on it.
3. Sepal - there are commonly green coloured leaves which makethe outer part of the flower.
The main function of sepal is toprotect flower in bud stage.
"4. Petals - there are basically shining, colorful and open flower. This is the mostly seen upper part of the flower."
The mainfunction of this part is to attract insects on flowers.
"5. Stamen - these are thread like long parts which has flowerlike structure,"
this is the male part of the flower.
6. Pistil - this part is in the centre of the flower and is thereproductive part of the flower.
d. fruit
Fruits are made from flowers.
"Mango, jamun or java plum,pomegranate, strawberry etc are fruits"
"and tomatoes, cucumberetc are included in vegetables are also fruits;"
there is a seed presentinside the fruit.
For example - mango and tomato has more thanone seed.
Parts of fruit
To learn more about the structure and parts of fruit we take mangoas an example.
There are two main parts of fruit:
1. The centre part is a tight seed in the fruit.
2. Outside the thick art of the fruit has been divided in manysuch categories
"like upper peel, seed plum, and the part relatedto internal seed."
Groundnut is also a type of fruit and its upper part is completelydry.
Functions of fruit
1. protects the seed - fruit protects the seeds from wear -tear
"andalso from adverse seasons like dryness summer, winter etc."
"2. Attract organisms or scattering of seeds - seeds are eatableand tasty. Due to this reason buds, animals and organismsmove from tree to tree."
"Wherever they eat, they scatter theseed and this helps in growing up of plants at different places."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 5.3
1. What is the name of thick part which keeps fruit straight?
2. What is the name of green structures on the outer part of flower?
3. What do we get from fruits?
Bacteria are the simplest and smallest organism found onearth.
"Algae is a green colored single cell organism found in water,it has a cell membrane and chlorophyll."
It is a single cellorganism.
Fungi are common chlorophyll microscopic organisms. Somefungi are big also.
Plant has a root and shoots system.
Roots always grow below the soil.
"Roots are of two types -joint roots and fiber roots,"
"The function of roots is to keep plant stable,"
absorb waterand minerals from soil
and providing food to the upper stemand branch etc.
Roots of some plants store food and roots ofsome plants also make new plants.
Stem has anther and stamen..
There are leaves in anther.
Leaves make food for the plants with the process ofphotosynthesis.
"Flowers are the reproductive parts of fruits,"
"the main parts offlowers (from outside to inside are ) bud, petals, stamen andpistil."
Petals give protection to bud.
They attract insect etc becauseof their colour. Stamen produces pollen which moves to pistilto make fruit.
Fruit provides protection to seeds.
Fruits can be dry like groundnut or fiber like mango. Theseare the two types of fruits.
Fruits are tasty and attract insects. They eat and scatter seedsfor plant scattering.

FUNCTION SYSTEM OF PLANT
"You have already read about the body. We will learn about plants, its various parts, structure and functions."
Now we will learn aboutsome of the special activities of the plants in detail in this lesson.
All the organisms of the world are a kind dependent onphotosynthesis.
Plants can make their food directly
and otherorganisms eat these plants directly or indirectly to get energy.
"Besides, oxygen is given out during the process of photosynthesiswhich is used by all organisms for breathing."
Plants also breathe.
They also take out waste material or elementsfor themselves.
The most important objective of plants is to spreador expand its species and therefore it reproduces.
We will alsolearn how plants reproduce in this lesson.
"After learning this chapter, you will be able to:"
""
Explain the process of respiration in plants ;
Describe the importance of excretion in plants ;
Tell the process of absorbing water and minerals in plants and
Explain the reproduction system in plants.
6.1 WHAT IS NUTRITION
Nutrition is the process in which an organism (even if it is aplant or organism) intakes food and makes it to be used by thebody and then use it
Why should living organisms take food?
1. To make new body element for development and growth
2. To maintain the wear and tear of damaged cells
3. To make the power to fight diseases
4. To provide energy for the body
5. To make many types of enzymes and hormones for thebody
6.2 PHOTOSYNTHESIS (FOOD PRODUCTION)IN PLANTS
Photosynthesis or the process of making food in presence ofsunlight
is only found in green plants.
"These plants make theirfood with the help of chlorophyll, sunlight and carbon dioxidepresent in air. They also prepare glucose by absorbing water fromthe soil."
Sunlight or light can be used from many sources as well.
"But mostly in open nature, farming or forest , the light of the sunis present is sunlight which is used in photosynthesis."
You must be thinking that can there be photosynthesis is moon light?
"No, it is very slow light and there is no sufficient energyavailable."
Two main products- glucose is formed from food and oxygen -life giving gas are produced in photosynthesis.
These are thedual benefits.
Plants get food for themselves and plants alsomake food for other organisms
and secondly oxygen which isessential for all organisms is also produced.
Food is made by leaves but how does it reaches to other partsof the plants?
You have seen that leaves have veins which reach their smallbranches and every cell.
These veins absorb water through stemand to leaves.
Glucose made in the cell of leaves reach stem andother parts of plant through these veins.
It spreads to whole plantfrom top to bottom.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 6.1
Fill in the blanks with appropriate word:
1. Green plants make their own food with the processof ___________.
2. _______ gas is produced in atmosphere in the process ofphotosynthesis.
3. Green plants use ____ gas to make their food.
6.3 RESPIRATION
Plants do breathe in the same way as other organisms.
"They getenergy to do many activities in their body,"
for example - energyis required to make starch out of glucose.
Micro holes (stomata)present in leaves take oxygen inside and give carbon dioxideoutside;
this oxygen is used for respiration in the day. The oxygenis given out the process of photosynthesis;
"breathing is a chemicalprocess which uses cells, leaves, stem, roots etc in every plant."
These micro holes take oxygen inside one cell to another andtake it to all the sides.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 6.2
Fill in the blanks with appropriate words:
"1. Energy is produced in body like plants, _______ andhuman beings."
2. Leaves in plants take oxygen inside by ____.
6.4 EVAPORATION (WATER FROM PLANTSIN FORM OF VAPORS)
Roots of plants take a lot of water inside them.
This water movesto the top to bottom of the leaves being used as water and sourceof mineral salts for photosynthesis.
"This water stream moves ina regular way, therefore, most of the water becomes vapour whichgoes out through leaves."
This process called evaporation.
Around2% of the absorbed water in root is used in the process ofphotosynthesis.
Importance of photosynthesis
1. Making environment cool - conversion of water into vaporsgives coolness. Plants evaporate more in heat and summer.
"Therefore, more water is required in the plants in summerotherwise plants get dried out."
2. Distribution of water - leaves are the end point of plant.Therefore water is required to reach every part of plants. Inthis way water is used as water when required by plant andits parts.
3. Distribution of minerals - when we move roots to the top levelof pants then minerals are absorbed by them.
When leaves doevaporation then the element inside them becomes thick
and pulls more minerals from bottom.
"Therefore, all the nutrientsreach from one cell to another from top to bottom."
4. Removing excess of water - the process of evaporationvapourise the extra water present inside the plant.
6.5 ABSORPTION OF WATER ANDMINERAL SALTS BY PLANTS
"Plants which are grown in soil, absorb water and mineral saltsfrom soil and roots,"
plants need water due to many reasons.
Forexample -
"1. Every part of plant has some portion of water,"
2. Leaves get out of stem straight die to required amount of waterotherwise they will become loose and fall down.
3. Water serves as a raw material in the process of food makingor photosynthesis.
4. Evaporation of water in summer keeps plants cool in hotweather.
Need of mineral salts in plants
Plants require mineral salts in the same way as they require water.
"Some of the important minerals required by plants are calcium,potassium, nitrate, phosphate etc."
These are used in the structureof the plants.
Various minerals are also absorbed by the soil.
Absorbing water
Plants absorb water through roots.
Mineral salts too are absorbed by roots
and plant which move towards upper part of plant with water.
"These minerals with water reach the central part of stem calledxylem and is transported to upper branches and leaves,"
"mineralssalts and absorbs water moving up is called rasrohan , sucking ."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 6.3
Choose the correct option to fill in the blanks:
11. Evaporation in plants is done by ____. (roots/leaves)
2. Vaporization of _____ is called evaporation. (water/salts)
3. Vaporization helps in the distribution of ____ in plants.(water/food)
6.5 HOW NEW PLANTS ARE FORMED?
Every organism whether plant or organisms reproduces hisspecies and gives birth to new ones.
Giving birth to a child of itsown type is called reproduction.
Plants reproduce in two ways -through seeds or by stem or leaves.
a. reproducing through seeds and scattering of seeds
Most of the plants reproduce through seeds
but this process isnot an easy one.
"Example - If all the seeds of the plant falls at thesame place and gets sprouted, then all new born plants don't getproper sunlight and nutrients."
Nature has given us a system whereseeds scatter from far off place.
This kind of spreading of seed iscalled scattering.
"There are many methods of seed scattering.For example - air, water or by seeds themselves in their ownmanner."
1. Scattering of seeds by air
"some seeds have feathers or net, fiber comes out from them."
Theseseeds fly away to distance place.
Sehijan seeds have a featherlike shape
"whereas seamal seeds have hair like structure, due tothis factor, seeds fly from one place to another,"
Fruits of gulmehndi after ripening throws itself to a far offplace and get sprouted.
"In the same way peas, beans, fruits ofladyfinger also move from one place and seeds get scattered."
2. seed expansion in organisms
there is a story that squirrels made a jungle.
Squirrel hide seedsin soil while wanting to eat it but forgets it.
This way she hidesseeds in the whole mountain
which came into jungle.
"This is nota story. Birds and animals eat fruits and throw seeds at variousplace,"
"for example - mango, apple, jamun etc."
"In the same waybirds, squirrels, jackal, elephant etc also throw seeds after eatingfruits form one pace to another."
3. Scattering of seeds by water
The best example of seed expansion in water is coconut.
Its fibercover and closed in tight copra coconut falls from trees and istransported by water from one place to another.
6.6 SEEDLINGS OF SEEDS
"Reproduction is a plant gets completes when a seed makes anew pant after getting seedling,"
seeds have a small plants andalso stores food.
"This food is in the form of two seed parts. Example - gram, peas"
or in form if a single seed piece like wheatof maize.
Let us know about the process of seedling:
"1. Seed gets transformed into seedling by water, air (oxygen)and at optimum temperature."
2. The first characteristic of swelling is the swelling of seeds.
3. The cover of seed gets softened.
4. The white portion of seed is called basic seedling which getssprouted
and goes into soil in a long and slanted form.
Thisforms the primary root.
5. Soon after plant forms stem comes out and stands erect at thetop.
This keeps increasing and becomes a small plant.

6.7 REPRODUCTION BY STEM OR LEAVES
"Reproduction of new plants from any other part of plant, notflower is called asexual reproduction."
"This can be root, stem,leaves etc, in different plants,"
let us see some examples -
1. Leaves -
for example cells situated near the corners of leavesin byrofilm leaves
2. Stem like potato (tuber)
"and onions bulb, shalaj"
"3. Grafting , cutting parts of stem of some plants"
like rose orsugarcane and placing them in soil.
4. New plants are grown from pieces of ginger
INTEXT QUESTIONS 6.5
State whether the following statements are true or false:
1. Asexual reproduction is done in brofilin. ( )
"2. If ginger knots are kept in soil, new plants are grown. ( )"

"Basic life processes in organisms are nutrition, breathing,excretion, growth reproduction etc."
Every green plant makes their own food.
The process by which green plants make their own food iscalled photosynthesis.
oxygen gas comes out from this process.
"During breathing glucose is made from carbon dioxide, waterand energy in presence of oxygen."
Food prepared by leaves is sent to stem.
The process of vaporizing of water from water present in plants is called evaporation.
Roots of the plants take absorbed water and minerals to upperpart of the plant.
Reproduction is the process by which organism gives birthto a new species of same like.
There are two types of reproduction -
by seeds and by stemsor leaves.
"Seeds are scatters in many ways - air. Water, organisms andself plant's special seedling method."
The process by which small plants inside the seed gets activeand makes new plant is called sprouting and seedling.

PROCESS OF OUR BODY
Humans have made machines one after the other but the machinemade by nature is matchless.
Humans cannot make a machinethat has power to grow after taking food externally and produceor give birth to offspring like him.
Every activity in human body is wonderful.
To know and learnthese activities is interesting and beneficial.
This will help us ingrowing and remaining healthy.
"There are many systems in our body - moving system, digestivesystem, respiratory system etc."
let us know about these in detail.
"After reading lesson, you will be able to:"
Know the process of human walking
Understanding digestive system and
Explain the process of circulatory system
7.1 HOW CAN WE WALK?
We are not static at one place.
We are movable.
"We move fromone place to another. We can also move our hands, legs, headetc, all these movements are possible by the mixture of twosystems in human body - bones and muscles. All bones togethermake skeleton system and all muscles together make musclesystem."
a. skeleton system
Skeleton is a structure of bones which is hard and gives movementto many parts of body. These give support to the body.
The mainparts of skeleton are:
Skull - box giving protection to human mind
which starts frombrain and ends at spinal cord.
"Ribs - these cover lungs and heart,"
Bones of shoulder and hips
Bones of arms and legs
The total number of bones in our body is 206.
The longest boneis femer
in thighs
and the smallest bone is behind the ear drum
smaller than a grain of rice.
Joints
Joints are those places where one bone gets connected to otherbones.
For example- knee and below joints are moveable andstatic. Example - knee can be static like skull bones.
Movingjoints is a structure that keeps two bones together is called tendon.
Do you know how movements are connected?
You must haveseen the puppet game.
There are threads attached to the puppets.These threads are pulled out to make the movement of puppets.
There are muscles attaches to bones
which move automatically.
There are three more functions of skeleton system
1. it gives shape and support to body.
2. it gives security of soft parts of body
like skull to brain andrib makes lungs and heart secure.
3. bones give place to muscles join and helps in the movement
b. muscle system
There are more than 600 muscles in human body.
All thesemuscles provide movement to bones
"as well as soft body partslike heart, intestines etc."
Types of muscles
There are two types of muscles:
1. Voluntary muscles - these muscles work according to our wish.Example- muscles related to the movements of hands andlegs.
These muscles are connected to bones.
2. Non voluntary muscles - These muscles are not in our control
and keep working automatically.
Intestine muscles or stomachmuscles
work automatically and keeps on forwarding the foodfrom time to time.
Muscles are also found in the walls ofarteries and veins.
Heart muscles are also different in theirstructures. Their structures are related to voluntary musclesbut their work is non voluntary.
This is also called heartmuscles.
All muscles are made up of fiber.
How does a muscle work?
Muscles contract to do work.
"Voluntary muscles on one end arestatic or fixed and together are connected to moving bones,"
whena muscle contracts the movement of the bone happens as bone ispulled towards contracted muscles.
Contracted muscles get smaller and pulls its motion head giving wayto movement.
When contraction ends pulling of bones also ends
andmuscles come back to old form and moves in opposite direction.
Function of muscle system
1. muscles help us the movement of our body organs
"like walking,running or holding objects ."
2. they help us in swallowing and chewing food.
3. they help in expansion and contraction of chest leading to ourbreathing system.
4. they make heart pace muscles etc.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 7.1
1. which two system of human body help in the movement?
2. write the names of some parts of our skeleton?
3. write the names of organs protecting by the following:
i. Skull
ii. Rib
4. write the name of muscles found in heart wall?
5. what are the special tissues joining one bone to other onmovement called?
7.2 DIGESTION SYSTEM
"Every organism needs food to live,"
there are five steps of nutritionor food intake to its usage.
1. the process of taking food inside by eating or drinking.
2. making food ready for energy absorption or digestion.
3. digested food passes through food pipe and gets absorbed inbody through intestines.
"4. Absorbed food is used in the necessary required places ofhuman body,"
5. Non absorbed and non digested food comes out in form ofwaste from body.
a. parts of digestion system
1. mouth - teeth present inside our mouth cuts the food intopieces.
"Our salvia glands excrete salvia which softens the food,"
the enzyme present in salvia changes starch present in food tosoluble maltose.
There are two sets of teeth: temporary (milkteeth) (20)
which falls down and permanent teeth (20 and 12)come out.
Out of 12 temporary teeth every jaw has three teethon both sides to chew the food.
In the end one last wisdomtooth
comes out around 16-17 year. A wisdom tooth does notcome out in some people.
"There are many types of teeth in ajaw set which are used in chewing, cutting, grinding andmixing of food."
2. food is softened by mouth - salvia helps in chewing the food.This is secreted by the tongue. Tongue and teeth chew thefood.
Mostly the push of tongue helps the food to reach thefood pipe.
3. Food reaches a bag like stomach from food pipe.
4. food stays in stomach for 3-4 hours.
"By this time the juicefrom the walls of stomach mixes with food,"
this gastric juicehas pepsin enzyme which helps in digestion of protein.
Onemore acid comes out from this juice called hydrochloric acid.This acid destroys any bacteria coming with the food.
Foodreaches small intestine from stomach.
5. small intestine is around 7 meter long
with narrow structure.It has many spiral structures.
"Maximum food get digested here,"
"protein, carbohydrates, maltose, sucrose etc and fats aredigested by many enzymes."
These enzymes come out from pancreas and even small intestine.
Digestion is not neededfrom vitamins and mineral salts
they are absorbed directly inintestine.
"6. big intestine: small intestine is connected to big intestine,"
heremaximum water of the left food is absorbed.
"Voluntary muscles on one end arestatic or fixed and together are connected to moving bones,"
INTEXT QUESTIONS 7.2
1. how many teeth are there in the human mouth?
"Voluntary muscles on one end arestatic or fixed and together are connected to moving bones,"
3. which part of digestion pipe absorbs maximum water?
4. which juice is excreted by the walls of stomach?
7.3 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
You have leant about the respiration process of plants.
All livingorganisms including humans also breathe.
Our body needs energyfor many activities 24 hours a day.
This energy is used inside thecells during breathing. It uses oxygen to disintegrate glucose fromfood.
a. parts of respiratory system
"all the organs nose, lungs etc exchange blood and atmosphericair in between themselves. All these make respiratory system,"
allthese organs in sequence are:
A. nose
Air outside from the world enters our body through two nostrilsor nose holes.
The three characteristics of nose are:
1. the hair inside the nose stops dust etc from air entering ourbody.
"2. a sticky element, shesleshma, excreted from nose sticks itselfwith virus and bacteria and other particles and stops themfrom entering body."
3. air going through nostrils keeps the temperature of body warmand moisture.
B. Food pipe
This is the back part of our mouth which takes air inside and food intake by our mouth is same.
The bottom part of pipe isLarynx which opens in vocal cords which opens in breathingpipe.
Remember it is a structure epitolits which protects the gatesof vocal cords
so that the food ontake does not go inside the foodpipe.
But if it gets then food gets stuck in breathing pipe.
C. Respiration pipe
This is a straight pipe going to the centre of chest starting fromvocal cords.
"There are cartilages, spiral in shape, in its wallswhich does not make it sticky."
Breathing cells and veins
"Breathing pipe is divided in two parts - from back of head whichis called swahashnitan, breathing centre."
Both the cells enterlungs from their sides.
They get divided into small branches insidelungs
"which is called shawahansikayen, breathing cells."
"Air passage, vayukosh"
Breathing cells are opened in
the end point of closed air passage.
These are lakhs in number
and their total internal surface can bemore than a big kabbadi stadium.
they have a large surface so thatthey can exchange respiratory gases more and more.
Those peoplewho smoke cigarette and bidi have many side effects on their airpassage. It gets closed
and they suffer from respiratory diseases.
Lungs
These are a pair of sponge bag like structure
which are close tothe walls of chest.
Blood having more carbon dioxide and less oxygen reach lungs.
"Many minute branches of blood cells coverair passage and they became blood veins, lung veins, after manymovements."
These lung vein join together to form a primary lungveins which reaches heart.
Blood reaching heart from lungs isfull of oxygen.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 7.3
1. Which way of food and breathing is similar and which part?
2. Fill in the blanks:
i. Division of breathing cells make_____.
ii. Blood entering lungs is full of _ but when it comes out oflungs it is full of ____.
7.4 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Have you ever though that how digested food from food pipeand absorbed food from body reaches every cell?
"Carbon dioxidefrom all body parts and other waste elements related to wastematerials, kidney, lungs etc?"
All there works are done by a pumpheart and artery coming out and reaching there. Blood flowingfrom there also helps in its functioning.
A. Heart
If you keep our hand at a slight left side you will hear or fellheart beat. This sounds like dhak dhak.
This happens with everyhuman heart beat.
Heart is a small muscular organ
equal size of a fist
andis established between the lungs in a cage.
This is made upof tight muscles which work throughout life and does not gettired.
1. Functions of heart
The heart of a healthy adult person beats 60-80 times per minute
average 72 beats per minute.
There are four chambers of heart
two in upper side right -left atria
and bottom left -right ventricles.
Right side of heart side has less oxygen blood and more carbondioxide blood which reaches lungs.
The pumped blood from lungswhich has less amount of carbon dioxide and more oxygenreaches to the left side of heart where blood vessels take thisblood to every cell of human body.
2. Blood carrier cells or vessels
These are of three types:
i. Arteries - these take blood containing oxygen to various partsof the body from heart.
Their walls are thick and muscular.
"ii. Veins - they bring oxygen less blood from many parts of bodyto heart,"
then this blood is sent to lungs.
"iii. cells - Arteries are divided in many branches and they joinagain together to form veins, this is a cage of veins."
Minuteblood cells in this system are called cells.
3. Blood
Blood is a shining red coloured liquid which flows in arteriesand veins.
"Our blood has red blood cells and white blood cells.White blood cells are actually colourless, it also has very minuteblood platelets."
Functions of blood
i. it takes oxygen from lungs to various parts of the body.
ii. it also takes absorbed food from intestine to many parts ofwhole body.
iii. blood also takes waste material from body cells to kidney sothat they come out as a part of urine.
iv. it also protects our body from infection.
v. it also controls body temperature and keeps it static.
vi. if there is any injury or cut then blood clotting happens andstops the flowing of blood.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 7.4
1. What is the importance of muscles present in the walls ofheart?
2. how many times a heart beats in one minute of a normal adulthuman?
3. what is the real color of white blood cells present in blood?
The organ system of our body does not function alone but all together with coordination.
The movements of our body are the dynamic system
andcontrols bones and muscles.
"The main function of skeleton system is to give shape to body,support it ,"
contribute in movements
and protecting soft organsetc.
All the muscles of a body together form muscular system.
muscles give body movement
and produces beating in heart.
Digestion system makes food easily digestible and absorbsnutritional elements.
There are two types of breathing -
first breathing from lungsboth - intake and exhale
in which oxygen is taken insideand carbon dioxide is released
and second type blood sendsabsorbed oxygen to body cells for making energy which isused for cell breathing.
Circulatory system sends nutrients and oxygen to their usefulorgans and takes carbon dioxide and other wastes from variousparts of human body.
"This work is done by heart, arteries andblood."
Heart is a small muscular organ.
It has strong muscles
andcreates or produces heartbeat throughout life.

VARIOUS ORGANS OFOUR BODY
You have learnt about many organs of our body.
Every organ ofthe body has a different function.
But every organ functions makean organism healthy and keep specie alive.
Look at any construction site around you. You will find somegarbage or waste material.
This too happens with body.
To throwsuch waste material out of human body we have excretion system.
When many people work together then a system is required forco-ordination.
This too happens with body.
"Since many systemsare working together, there can be no chaos. Therefore, acoordinating system is required."
This function is done by nervoussystem and control system in our body.
We will learn aboutexcretion system and nervous system in this lesson.
"After learning this lesson, you will be able to:"
Understand the importance of excretion system in human body.
Describe the function of excretion system of human body
Tell the meaning of nervous system and
Explain the functions of nervous system
8.1 EXCERTION SYSTEM
Every cell of our body keeps on doing something or the other.
"Therefore, some garbage is always found there."
These elementsare harmful and should not be collected in body. It should bethrown out of the human body.
The process of throwing outharmful or waste material is called excretion
and the groups oforgans related to it are called excretion system.
Our body excretes or excretion by three types:
1. lungs: we throw out polluted carbon dioxide produced duringbreathing.
2. skin: some mineral salts are bit required by our body are thrownout in form of sweating.
"3. Urine: Our body comprises of water,"
a balance of wateris required in human body.
It should not be more or less.
Urine takes out chemical wastes and extra water out of ourbody.
Urine system
There are many parts of urine system:
1. kidney: these look like a pair of seed of beans shaped organs.
Functions of kidney
a. To separate impurities of blood especially urea which reachkidney by artery
b. To create a balance between water and Mineral salts inbody
2. Urethra: there is a urethra from every kidney which reachesdown bladder.
Its functions is to take urine to bladder.
3. Bladder: this is like a flexible bag.
It is used to store urinetemporarily
4. Urine pipe: this is a pipe made up of small muscles to takeout urine from the body time to time.
"If one of our kidney stops working, then the other starts workingdouble."
If both kidneys get damaged then these can be transplanted by medicines.
this is the reason why organ donationis promoted now a days.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 8.1
1. What do you mean by excretion?
2. What are the three methods by which waste material comesout of human body?
3. Write the sequences of various parts of urine system?
4. How urine comes out of kidney and by which structure?
5. Which is the organ that stores urine temporarily ?
8.2 NERVOUS SYSTEMS
"We must know whatever is happening around us what, why andhow?"
"How our food tastes - eatable or rotten, bad smell and noneatable? How do we know all these things?"
"We see people,identify them, listen to their thoughts and speak our thoughtsetc."
""
All these co-ordinating activities are done by our brain andnerves which is called nervous system.
1. Parts of nervous system
"Various organs of our body form nervous system,"
following arethe parts of nervous system-
1. brain
2. Spinal cord
3. nerves
4. sensory organs
1. brain -
human brain is a soft and delicate part.
It is around 3 to5 kg kilograms in an adult.
This part is safe in skull.
Human brain is the biggest size in all living organisms.
It has theonly secret of how humans can do all other works that otherorganisms cannot do.
Parts of brain
i. Fore brain: this is the biggest part of brain.
Its main function is to think and remember.
"This part is related to will power,intelligence and consciousness."
"It also gives us other areasrelated to knowledge centre like speaking, seeing, taste andsmell."
ii. Mid brain:: this s a small part found below fore brain andback side of skull.
Its function is to control muscles.
iii. Medulla oblongata - this is also known as pillar of brain.
Itsfunction is to control involuntary activities
like heart rateand exhale breathing.
2. Spinal cord
this is a pipe like structure
"Various organs of our body form nervous system,"
All message sent frombrain to body reach by this pipe.
This also helps in giving fastreaction
like if a thorn pricks than we take our hand backinternally.
3. nerves
nerves are small and slippery white structures whichmake messages from brain like electric current.
"All thenerves coming out of brain, skull and spinal cord are called spinalnerves"
Types of nerves
"1. Sensory nerves - these nerves take messages from sensoryorgans like eyes, nose, ears etc and sent them to brain."
2. Central nerves - these nerves come out from dynamic ormoving organs
"like muscles relating to eyes and around eyeswith brain,"
Mixed nerves- These nerves are for both
"sending andreceiving messages,"
there are 31 pairs of nerves coming outof spinal cord.
Functions of nervous system
"1. These nerves control our reaction coming out of externalnervous system world,"
2. It also controls other system of the body.
"3. it helps in the moving movements as we want like walking,doing movements etc."

3. Where is our brain situated?
4. What are the three main parts of human mind?
5. Which part is your brain controls your emotions?
6. Where is the centre for controlling heart beating located?
8.3 OUR SENSORY ORGANS
"Organs which tell us about the presence, element or taste of anyobjects are called sensory organs,"
"we can see, listen or feel bythese organs"
we have five sensory organs
"eyes, ears, nose, tongueand skin."
1. eyes- eyes are essential to read and see objects around us.
When a light ray comes to eyes from an object than nervesinside our eyes get stimulated and sends messages to brain.
Brain reads the messages and draws a whole picture of theobject.
We can see and understand many surrounding objects by thismethod.
"2. Ear- these are spreading on face. The sensory nerves inside ears get shook and hearnews is sent as message to the brain,"
They take sound waves insidethe body.
this also shows thebalance of body which can be seen through ear.
3. Nose - nose helps in sending smell of various kinds andmessage to brains.
We can identity many tasty foods by smellonly.
4. Tongue- this helps un identifying taste of various types
"likesweet, sour, bitter, warm , hot, salty etc."
"5. Skin - this sensory organs tell us about pain, feel, warm- cold,hard-soft etc by touching."
"Some of the areas of skin havehigh degrees of touch like fingers on head, hot-cold at somearea like cheeks etc."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 8.3
1. List the sensory organs found in our body?
2. How does our eye identify an object?
3. How does tongue identify taste?
4. What is the other function of ear besides hearing?
Taking out of harmful products produced by physical activityin body is called excretion.
"Lungs, skin and kidney help in excretion."
Mainly excretion is done by urethra.
"There are two kidney inurine system, two ureter, bladder and urine pipe coming outof them."
Nervous system tells us about outside world and coordinatedwith internal organs of the body.
"The main parts of nervous system are brain, spinal cord, nervesand sensory organs."
"Brain is the centre of forebrain thinking, intelligence etc andmidbrain controls the movement of muscles."
Spine bone is fixed in back bone and is the medium of sending messages to the brain.
"There are three kinds of nerves namely, sensory nerves, motornerves ad mixed nerves."

HEALTHY LIFE ANDCLEANLINESS
"You must have heard of the saying, 'health is wealth'."
We alwayswant that we should not fall ill. We eat properly to work in abetter way.
By doing this we will be happy and healthy.
Peoplearound us will be happy seeing us happy.
This is called healthylife.
Healthy life means a body free from diseases and a mindfree from mental problems.
"To be healthy we require cleaning our body, follow good habitsand take healthy and proper diet."
Exercise and taking rest is alsoimportant.
"If we have the deficiency of any element in our body,it will make us dull, ill and suffer from many diseases."
To saveourselves from diseases we should have immunity power to fightdiseases.
Immunity power can be increased by vaccination andproper diet.
Our ancient scriptures have laid emphasis on it.
"Evenayurveda says that we should live balanced life, exercise dailyand follow rules"
to be healthy and to live a long life.
It is said'jiveta Sharad Shatam'.
Let us now understand what important for a healthy life isin this lesson.
"After understanding this lesson, you will be able to:"
Tell the importance of food for the body ;
Describe the importance of necessary nutrition elements forthe body ;
Explain the diseases cause because of deficiency of somenutrients ;
Explain balance diet ;
Describe the importance of cleanliness for good health
9.1 FOOD AND ITS NUTRIENTS
"You must have felt that whenever we feel hungry, we eat food."
Food not only ends our hunger but also gives us energy.
Foodgives energy to do some essential elements required for theimportant works of the body.
All the elements found in foodwhich are essential for our body are called nutrients.
"Variousnutrient elements found on our food are carbohydrates, protein,fats, vitamins and mineral salts etc."
Let us know about from where we can find nutrients what aretheir functions and which diseases are caused by their deficiency.
a) carbohydrates
"This is an important element in our food,"
"the main function ofcarbohydrates is to provide energy for physical work like playing,learning, working in a farm or factory etc."
"Whenever you aresitting or sleeping, various activities also take place like breathing,pumping of heart, food digestion etc."
We require energy for theseprocesses also.
Do you know that carbohydrates contributes inmaking a food tasty?
"The main food elements in our food which gives us energy areall types of grains like wheat, rice, maize, millet, bajra, ragi etc."
"we also get energy from roots kandmool, example, potato, arbi, turnip, sugarcane, banana etc."
"other sources of carbohydrate aresugar, honey and jiggery."
"If we take extra carbohydrates in ourbody, they get deposited in the form of fats in our body."
If the intake of carbohydrates in less in our body then our weightgets reduced and we feel tired.
b) Protein
Protein is essential for the development of body.
"Therefore, wemust consume protein rich food. This helps us in building ofnew cells, tissues, organs, hormones and hemoglobin, red pigmentin blood. It also helps in the maintenance of damaged cells."
"Allpulses like masoor, moong, urad, rajma etc gave high protein."
"Our body also gets protein from milk, curd, paneer, meat, fisheggs etc."
9.2 SOURCES OF PROTEIN
Children need protein in more quantity.
This element is importantfor their growth.
Less consumption of protein leads to lessdevelopment of body and mind
lack of energy and malnutrition is causedby the lack of protein in food.
This malnutrition is of two types-Kwashiorkor and marasmus.
Kwashiorkor : This is caused mainly by the lack of protein.
"Here the child has swelling on his hand, legs and face, he alsosuffers from loose motions. He gets a fat belly."
Marasmus : This disease is caused because of less carbohydratesintake in food by child.
His muscles start drying up.
He gets wrinkles on his skin.
This disease is also called dry disease. Child cannotgrow in this disease and his skeleton can be seen in his body.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 9.1
Fill in the blanks:
1. Carbohydrates provide _____ for doing many physicalactivities.
2. Protein elements help in the _____ of new tissues in our body.
"3. Child gets _____ on his hands, legs and face and has _____ inKwashiorkor disease."
4. Less intake of carbohydrates leads to _____ disease.
5. Child muscles get dried up and _____ are on skin in marasmusdisease.
c) fat
fat gives us energy.
It gives a soft layer on the heart.
Thereforeheart does not get damaged by a push or injury.
"Some vitamins (like a, d, e, k ) are soluble in fat and fat helps us in gettingthem from the food. Fats are important to make our body work"
"various food items like bitter, ghee, cream, malai, oil (mustard,cocount, groundnut, til etc) give fat."
But extra fat is not goodfor health.
Therefore we must take foods giving fat in a limitedmanner.
"Ghee, butter and malai consumption can be dangerousto elderly people."
Fats give more energy than carbohydrates whenneeded.
Mineral salts
We require very less amount of mineral salts found in our food.
"But for the proper functioning and growth of human body, mineralsalts are required"
"for example - for building blood in human body,iron is required."
"Therefore, it is essential to have mineral salts inour food."
There are various sources of getting mineral salts. Wewill read their functions and diseases cause by their deficiencyare given later in this chapter.
d) Calcium
calcium helps in building bones and teeth.
It also controls thespeed of muscles.
"We get calcium form milk, paneer, curd, buttermilk, green leafy vegetables (spinach, reddish, cauliflower, methi,arbi ke patte, bajra, black grans) etc."
Its deficiency leads toweakness of bones and their deformation.
teeth also get weak bythe deficiency of calcium.
e) iron element
iron is required for the building hemoglobin a red pigment foundin red blood cells in blood.
"It is mostly found in green leafyvegetables, Bajra, chidwa, ragi, murmura, jaggery, roasted gram,masoor dal, fish etc."
The deficiency of iron leads to a diseasecalled anemia. Anemia refers to the deficiency of red blood cells.
Patient feels weak and his breathing is abnormal.
His nails getyellow. He does not feel good to eat something.
f) iodine
"This salt is essentials for the growth, development and functioningof biological activities."
The most common source of iodine issalt with iodine.
Iodine is also found in extra amount in foodobtained from sea.
Deficiency of iodine leads to goiter.
It alsoleads to the swelling of thyroid glands.
Deficiency of iodine leadsto improper growth of children.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 9.2
1. Which functions of human body are related to calcium?
2. why is iron important for us?
3. write any two sources of iodine?
4. match the following
Mineral salts ----- deficiency disease
Iodine ----- deformed bones
Calcium ----- anemia (less blood)
Iron ----- goiter
9.4 VITAMIN
There is an importance of vitamins like other nutrient elements.
Vitamins are required for many biological activities in humanbody.
There are required in small amount.
"There are many typesof vitamins like a, b, c,c d, e, k etc."
"Let us know can we get vitamins, what are their functions andwhat are the diseases caused by their deficiency."
1. vitamin a
"It helps in proper functioning of eyes, keeping skin healthy andboosting immunity power of body to fight disease."
"This is foundin bajra, papapya, sitafal, carrot, mango, yellow maize, greenleafy vegetables, like, egg, butter, fish etc."
"deficiency of vitamincauses night blindness,"
patient cannot see properly in dim lightin this disease.
More deficiency of vitamin a causes blindness.
2. vitamin d
It is essential for building bones and increasing their strength.
Vitamin d is build by our body with the help of sunlight.
This isthe cheap and simple medium of getting vitamin D.
"vitamin D isalso found in fish oil, egg and kaleji."
"Deficiency of vitamin dcauses rickets,"
bones get weak and legs get deformed in shape ofbow.
3. vitamin e
This vitamin is required for reproduction capacity
"this ismostly found in vanaspati oil, fish, egg, flour with choker, milk etc."
Its deficiency causes sterility meaning less reproductivecapacity.
4. vitamin k
This vitamin helps in blood clotting after an injury;
"the mainsources of vitamin k are green leafy vegetables, cauliflower,cabbage etc."
deficiency of vitamin k causes more time in bloodclotting after an injury which can be dangerous.
5. vitamin b complex
"Many vitamins are found in this group of vitamins, example b12."
These are necessary for the development and growth of body.
"They keep our muscles and skin healthy,"
"some of the sources ofvitamin b complex are - sabot and sprouted pulses, milk and itsproduct."
Deficiency of vitamin b causes bery-beri.
This leads toless hunger and problem in digestion.
"The corners of mouth getcut,"
"tongue gets rough and red, misbalance in biological processis caused by the deficiency of vitamin b complex."
6. vitamin c
It is essential for wound filling.
"This keeps our skin, teeth,bones, healthy and strong."
It also gives power to fight diseases.
"It is found in raw fruits and vegetables, amla, lemon, grapes,tomato, sprouted pulses, sahjan ki fali etc,"
"deficient of vitamin ccauses scurvy,"
gums get swollen and blood starts coming out ofthem.
It takes time to cure wounds and immunity power getslessened.
INTEXT QUESTIONS 9.3
State whether the given statements are true or false:
1. Vitamin a helps in proper functioning of eyes.

"5. guava, lemon and orange are good sources ofvitamin a."
6. beri beri is caused by the deficiency of vitamin b.
7. gums get swollen by the deficiency of vitamin c.
9.5 OTHER ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF FOOD
Other nutrients which are required for good health include waterand fiber. These are essential for a good health.
let us know moreabout it.
Water: water is required for all biological activities of humanbody.
"About 55% of human body is water,"
water is required tokeep human temperature normal (98.4 degree Fahrenheit or 37degree Celsius).
We require more water in summer.
We shouldalways drink water and other liquid drinks.
We should alwaysdrink 7-8 glass of water every day.
Fiber: fiber is also an important part of our food eating.
Eatingfiber in optimum quantity helps us in constipation and providesproper digestion of food.
It also supports proper excretion out of human body.
Eating good amount of fiber saves us from obesity.
"We get required fiber from green leafy vegetables, fruits, sabotgrains, pulses etc."
9.6 BALANCED DIET
To be healthy we require nutrient elements in optimum quality.
Eating all essential nutrients in optimum quantity in our food iscalled balanced diet.
We could not get all nutrient elements byeating same food every day.
We must mix and inter change manyfood items for a balanced diet.
Balanced diet is a diet which hasall essential items required by our body in optimum amount.
1. malnutrition
Have you ever thought what are the harmful effects of not havinga balanced diet?
Our body gets deficient after not taking balanceddiet.
This might also lead to the maximum intake of some nutrientelements.
This is called mal nutrition.
2. alp poshan
After eating less than required food or intake of few nutrients
causes less nutrition.
Many diseases can be caused because offewer nutrients. Body does not get all sufficient minerals in properquantity.
3. ati poshan
Do you know that obesity is also a disease?
"Some people eatmore than required and do less physical activity,"
because of this fat gets deposited in human body and the person get obese orfatty.
This is called ati poshan.
Many diseases like diabetes bloodpressure etc are caused because of obesity.
"Therefore, we musteat sweets, butter, ghee etc in proper amount."
"We should eat rawfruits, green vegetables, sabot grains, pulses and fiber in goodquantity to save ourselves from obesity."
Diet group
"We eat many types of food product everyday like roti, pulses,rice, vegetables, curd etc."
This is possible that some mineralelements are high in some product and other nutrition elementsare less.
There are mainly five categories of diet
based onnutritional elements found in them.
The benefit of dividing foodproducts in these categories is that we can exchange the categoryof food with the other.
"If we eat only one type of food productthen we will get same nutrient cements,"
"for example if we eatwheat or maize flour, rice or bajra, we will get same nutrients."
INTEXT QUESTIONS 9.4
1. What is the meaning of balanced diet?
2. Why is fiber important in food ?
3. Why is water important for us?
9.7 NEED FOR CLEANLINESS
You have read of diseases which are caused by the deficiency ofnutrients.
"But some diseases are caused by the uncleanatmosphere around us,"
some diseases are transmitted from one person to another.
Such diseases are called communicablediseases.
"These are spread by coughing, sneezing, breathing, usingdirty water and dirty food where mosquitoes-flies etc. sits."
"Somecommunicable disease are typhoid, measles, cholera, corona,polio, malaria etc,"
"therefore, it is necessary to clean our houseand neighbourhood to save us from diseases. Personal hygieneand cleanliness is also very important."

Sounds of Sanskrit language are described in Maheshwara Sutras.
There are basic of Sanskrit grammar.
All the Vowels and Consonants are told in there Maheshwara Sutras.
recite all 14 Maheshwara Sutras;
know Sanskrit Sounds; and
identify the Pratyaharas.
There is story behind the Samskrita alphabets.
Nataraja is other name of Shiva.
He is in the dancing pose.
Nataraja has Damaru in his one hand.
"Damaru is a small two-headed drum, used in many Indian, Buddhist and Tibetan traditions."
Damru is known as the instrument of Lord Shiva.
Damaru was first created by Shiva to produce different sounds.
Sanskrit Alphabets origined from  the  sound  of  the  Damaru  of  the  Lord  Shiva  called Maheswara Sutras.
"Mãhesvara Sutrani is fourteen verses that organize the phonemes of  Sanskrit  as  referred  to  in  the Astadhyayi  of  Panini,  the foundational text of Sanskrit grammar."
A famous verse in Sage Panini's Ashtadhyayi says that the Panini grammar that is in use now is graced by Lord Shiva.
Hence the first  known  organized  sounds  are  known  as  the  Maheshvara Sutra - Maheshvara being another name of Lord Shiva.
Here is the verse from Panini's Ashta-Dhyayi:
"At  the  end  of  his  cosmic  dance,  Shiva,  the  Lord  of  dance, with a view to bless the sages Sanaka and so on, played on his Damaru  fourteen  times,  from  which  emerged  the  following fourteen Sutras, popularly known as Shiva Sutras or Maheshvara Sutras"
"Within the tradition they are known as the Aksarasamamnaya,recitation of phonemes, but they are popularly known as the Siva Sutras because they are said to have been revealed to Panini by Shiva."
They were either composed by Panini to accompany his Astadhyayi or predate him.
"These  fourteen  sutras  contain  all  the  letters  of  the  sanskrit varnamala- the svaras (vowels) a, i, u, r, lr, e, ai, o, au and all the  vyanjanas  (consonants)."
"You  find  half  letters  in  the  end of each Sutra for a reason. As per the Rig Veda, Lord Siva brought this  Sanskrit  alphabet  sequence  and  the  Sanskrit  language  to earth."
The sounds of the alphabet originated from Lord Siva's damaru'.
The Sanskrit alphabet sequence is known as the 'Varna-mala'.
"The word 'varna' (o.kZ) means a 'syllable' and all the energies related to that syllable - color, presiding force, the mouth part used to pronounce each syllable, the related body part etc."
"Pratyahara is bringing together; bringing together of several letters (or words in a few cases, such as roots or nouns) by mentioning the first and the last only for the sake of brevity; the term izR;kgkj is generally used in connection with brief terms such as v.k~] vd~] vp~] gy~ and the like, created by Panini in his grammar by taking any particular letter and associating it with any mute final letter (vuqcU/k) of the fourteen Sivasutras, with a view to include all letters beginning with the letter uttered and ending with the letter which  precedes  the  (mute)  letter."
"The  practice  of  using  such abbreviations  was  in  existence  before  Panini,  possibly  in  the grammar attributed to Indra."
"Economy  (Sanskrit:  laghava)  is  a  major  principle  of  their organization,  and  it  is  debated  whether  Panini  deliberately encoded phonological patterns in them (as they were treated in traditional phonetic texts called Pratyhara) or simply grouped together phonemes which he needed to refer to in the Ashta dhyayi and which only secondarily reflect phonological patterns."
"As an example, consider Ashtadhyayi 6.1.77: iKo yan aCi:"
"iK means i, u, r, ir;"
"iKo is iK in the genitive case, so it means ' in place of i, u, r, ir;"
"yan means the semivowels y v r l and is in the nominative, so iKo yan means: y v r l replace i u r ir;"
"aC means all vowels, as noted above"
"aCi is in the locative case, so it means before any vowel."
"Hence  this  rule  replaces  a  vowel  with  its  corresponding semivowel when followed by any vowel, and that is why dadhi together with atra makes dadhyatra."
Mahesvara  Sutrani  are………..verses  that  organize  the phonemes of Sanskrit.
Ashtadhyaya was written by…………..
………………  brought  out  the  sequence  of  alphabets  of Sanskrita.
The sanskrit alphabet sequence is known as the …………….
Maheswara Sutra is the most ancient known Sanskrit alphabet sequence.
Sanskrit Alphabets originates from Maheswara Sutras.
"There is fourteen verses that organize the phonemes of Sanskrit as referred to in the Ashtdhyayi of Panini, the foundational text of Sanskrit grammar."
"The  fourteen  sutras  contain  all  the  letters  of  the  Sanskrit varnamala- the svaras (Vowels) a, i, u, r, ir, e, ai, o, au and all the vyanjanas (Consonants)."

"In our lifetime, we come across with different kind of people."
We may be different in many ways.
"But also we may have some similarities, something common which makes us one."
"These may be common goals, inner values  for the society and follow the right path to reach our goals. Our ancient texts are full with such values and suggesting the right ways to humankind."
This lesson discuss about some shlokas of Bhagwad Gita through a beautiful story.
recite 18 shlokas of Samarasya-Shloka-Sangraha; and
know that there are different paths to one goal.
"There  was  a  mountain.  There  were  four  villages  around  the mountain;  Ramapura,  Bharatapura,  Lavapura  and  Kushapura."
None of the villages were connected to each other.
The people in the villages did not know each other.
"Every time the people of each village looked at the mountain, they could see a big white flag."
They thought it's the representation of their village and there must  be a message for the villagers.
"On one fine day, four boys from each village wanted to go close and know the details of that flag. However, they were not aware that boys from other villages are doing the same. As it was going to take long way to reach the peak, so they packed food for afternoon lunch and set out for climbing the mountain."
"By the time they reached the mountain peak and were just little bit behind from the flag, they were all really tired, so wanted to eat lunch and have a small nap. Surprisingly, all the boys from all the villages met in one point. Boys of four villages exchanged their reasons to climb the mountain."
"Interestingly, all of them had the same goal to find about the white flag."
"As soon as all the boys go close to the flag, they read a message for all the villagers."
"'This white flag is the symbol of brotherhood of people of four village, once a while people should come here and spend time together to celebrate New Year''."
Reading this message made all the boys very happy and started coming together annually.
"See the example here - one mountain, four villages, four paths leading to one goal towards flag."
"Ramapura had a path of stones and  jerky  way, Bharatapura  had  bushy  and  thorn  full  plants, Lavapura  had  high  trees  and  clear  path  and  Kushapura  had slippery path."
