'Gita to be read' is a wish of every person.
Bhagvat Gita is spoken by Krishna using Sanskrit language.
Lack of knowledge of Sanskrit is a problem for understanding of the Gita.
"Hence, being able to use the Gita as a medium of practice of Sanskrit language is a thought of Sanskrit Bharati; and its first part is this Gita-Sopaan."
This is that Gita-Sopaan's first part.
"On the basis of the Gita, these lessons are constructed for the step-wise increase of your knowledge of Sanskrit language and skill development."
"Here, for the presentation and practice of each topic, only the sentences related to Gita and Mahabharat are mostly accepted."
"In lesson titles too, as far as possible, along with the topic of that particular chapter, only the appropriate sentences from Gita are used."
"At the start of each lesson, kindly read the instructions carefully."
"Then, kindly follow your teacher's guidelines."
It is immensely beneficial to read aloud from day one.
"Hence, wherever 'read aloud' is suggested, kindly make sure to read aloud."
"Wherever there is an instruction to 'speak the sentences', kindly vocalize those sentences without hesitation."
"If you don't have much practice in Devanagari script, in that case, you will be able to practice with other books published by Sanskrit Bharati."
"For that purpose, kindly ask your Centre Teacher or Coordinator for information on many other books."
"In case there is any doubt regarding the lesson, feel free to ask your teacher for guidance."
Each day assign some time for Sanskrit practice and follow through.
This way your study will be organized.
May your Sanskrit study be successful.

The Indian science of evocation of Shlokas and Mantras is unprecedented in the World.
In no other country such a science of memorization exists.
"Hence, this is India's exceptionally rare gift to the World."
This very method of memorization is intelligently used to memorize Vedas too.
"With this method, within a year, Bhagvad Gita can be effortlessly  memorized by everyone across all ages."
That exercise happens in three steps.
"1) The teacher recites one Paadam (term or concept) at a time, then the student recites the same term twice and so four terms are recited and imprinted in mind."
Then the teacher recites second line of the same Shloka.
The student repeats the line and this way the second line is practiced.
"After that, the teacher recites the entire Shloka and the student repeats it twice."
"This way repetition of ten Shlokas, recited by the teacher, happens; two more Paadam (one line) of eleventh Shloka are recited and repeated."
"2) After that, the student independently repeats those ten Shlokas ten times continuously at an appropriate time at home, everyday for the next ten days."
"At the same time, after the ten Shlokas, he repeats one line of the eleventh Shloka too."
"While repeating the previous ten Shlokas, he must start from the first line of the eleventh Shloka."
"With this two time narration, before and after, a co-relation between the group of ten Shlokas is established."
"Those Shlokas, by way of repeating ten times for ten days, get repeated a hundred times and are always at the tip of the tongue."
