Welcome to the tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
Let's start today's tutorial with this image.
Today I will work with this image only to use it as an example.
"""Before we start to work with selection, I think you should understand a bit about what selections really are."""
This square is a selection and this part is outside of the selection.
"""These moving lines, here, are the border of the selection."""
The GIMP people call a selection as a channel;
"""a channel like Red, Green or Blue or an Alpha channel which controls the transparency."""
"""Outside of the selection, the value of this channel is zero"""
and inside it's 255 and between them is the border and between them there can be values lower than 255 and higher than zero.
"""So, 'changing a selection' or 'making a selection' is changing some numbers."""
"""And now, let's have a look at how to make a selection."""
"""For de-selecting a selection, there are 2 ways."""
"""First way is, go to Select and None."""
You can also use the key combination of Shift + Ctrl+ A and get rid of a selection.
"""Now, select the Rectangle Select Tool  and look into the options dialog."""
"""On the top, there are four choices."""
The first one is Replace the current selection.
"""So, I select different areas here and you can see that when I select a new area, the old selection is deleted."""
The second option is Add to the current selection.
"""By selecting that option, I can select different areas in the image and get a quite complicated selection."""
"""And if I go to my colour tabs and just pull the colour over to the selection, you can see, all the selected areas are filled with that colour and the area which is selected and not connected is also filled."""
"""So, adding something to a selection holds every selection as one, even if there is no connection between the parts of the selection."""
It's a bit complicated.
Press Ctrl + Z to undo the filling and shift + Ctrl + A to de-select everything and back to my options dialog.
"""Now, select a square here and select Subtract from the current Selection."""
I Select this area but nothing happens.
"""But when I select these areas, you can see that the edge is cut out."""
"""You can see that the frame of selection stays there and when I move it, changes can be made."""
"""So, the last selection you made can be changed until you click into another place to get a new selection. You can change your work all the time."""
Now the last option is Intersect with the current selection.
Let's try that.
I select a rectangle here and the area outside it is not selected and selections which were done before are deleted.
And only selection in this rectangle is kept.
I can also modify this rectangle until I have the area selected that I wanted.
"""So now, we have covered four modes i.e. Replace, Add, Subtract and Intersect."""
You can replace a selection by just clicking.
Adding can be done by Click and Shift.
"""So, let's try that. I press the shift key and then by clicking I start adding new selections."""
"""And, when I press the shift key and mouse key, a plus sign appears."""
"""Now, if I want to subtract the selection, I can press the Ctrl key and now I press the mouse key and start to move; you can see a minus sign."""
"""So, now, I can subtract the selection."""
"""And for intersection, Shift, Ctrl should be pressed together and then select an area for intersecting."""
If you memorize these key combinations you can select the area faster.
And the same keys are used by the other selection tool.
"""So, you will just have to learn them only once."""
"""Shift, Ctrl, A, disable all the selections and bring back to my normal mode and now let's start with other stuff here."""
Next option is Feather edges and when I select it you get another option here as Radius count.
"""So, I increase it a bit and select an area."""
"""Now you can see here, there is rounded corner."""
I don’t want rounded corners here.
"""Just to show you what has happened, I will fill this with black and I zoom into the image."""
"""You can see, here is  black colour in the middle and it fades out near the border and these margin ends are running in-between the real black and the original image and here, the value of selection is 128."""
"""So, the half black colour fades inside the selection and half outside."""
The margin end is the only real border of your selection when you have a hard selection.
Feather edges is a nice option to get smooth selections.
"""With Feather selection, you can get a less sharp scene and it is easier that way."""
Technically minded people call Feather selection as Gaussian Blur and the Radius I selected here is the radius of the Gaussian Blur.
The next option is Rounded corners.
It’s a rectangle with rounded corner and you can set the radius of the rounded corners.
Here is the round part and these margins are the straight parts.
Here is the next option Antialiasing.
This option sets the corner painting.
I just fill this selection with black and now I go back to my selection tool and I de-select Antialiasing and make another selection and fill this also with black.
"""So, select the zoom tool and de-select all selections with Shift + Ctrl + A and zoom into this area."""
"""And here, the edge is without antialiasing and it is either filled with black or not filled with black."""
"""And here, you can see the stair of grays."""
Here you can see the smooth corner without jaggies and that’s called antialiasing.
This selection does not have a rounded corner but it is series of steps.
"""And, when I go back to 100% zoom, I can see here are jaggies and it's not smooth but here it is smooth corners and you can easily try it for yourself."""
"""So, if you want to have smooth corners then select Antialiasing."""
"""And if you want to have these gray tones, in here, then deselect that option."""
"""So, I select that option and there is a sub option called Expand from centre."""
I select it and start working with it.
"""So, I place a point here and I start pulling my selection from here."""
"""You can see, it grows from that point and this point is always in the middle of the selection."""
"""When I de-select that option, I can pull selection here and the position of the corner changes according to my selection."""
There is a key code for this.
"""When I click at this point and press Ctrl,  I have a selection from center and the selection expands from center."""
"""And when I release the Ctrl key, the selection vanishes."""
"""When I press the Ctrl key before I press the mouse button, I can subtract a selection  but when I first press the mouse key and then the Ctrl key I get selection from centre."""
"""The next option here is Fixed aspect ratio and I can have here preselected aspect ratio as 1 by 1 and when I draw, it will always be a square."""
I can select here 2 by 3 (2:3) and I always get a selection in 2 by 3 ratio and switching to 3 by 2 (3:2) gives me a selection in landscape mode.
There is another way to create a perfect square.
I start the selection at this point and pull and then press shift.
Now the Fixed aspect ratio is selected with preselected value here.
"""And this is a fast way, so I can select areas with aspect ratios that I want and by just pressing shift."""
"""The next option is Highlight and when I use that, the area that is not selected is gray and all the area that is selected is white."""
And this concerns only the current selection so let's de-select it and look at other options.
"""Here you can set these values by hand and if you click on Fix here, then I can't change the size of the selection."""
"""But if I want to have set width two pixels less and height one pixel more, so it fine tunes the selection."""
I can move the selection a little bit to the right by increasing the value of X which is the point of origin.
"""And when I click on Fix, I can move the whole selection."""
"""So, the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ values are the point of origin of the left top point and with Fix button, I can block the movement."""
The next option is the Guides.
I can select a Centre line which shows me where the middle point of the selection is.
I can have the Rule of thirds which is used for the graphic work or I can have the Golden sections which is similar to the Rule of thirds.
On the bottom is Auto Shrink Selection and Shrink merged.
Auto Shrink Selection is not very useful.
"""But Shrink merged is an option which if selected, the algorithm looks at all the layers and if de-selected only the layer that you are working on, is taken into consideration."""
"""Before having a recap of these options, we will talk about Ellipse selection."""
"""So, de-select all the selections by pressing Shift + ctrl + A."""
"""On the top, you get the same options like Replace current selection, Add to the selection with Shift key before clicking and Subtract with Ctrl key before clicking and Intersect with Shift and Ctrl key befor"
Antialiasing is again for smooth edges.
It is more important with ellipse than with rectangles because ellipses are always round.
"""Feather edges, the same option as in rectangle."""
"""When I fill it with black , you can see a smooth gradient between black and white and these margin ends are in-between black and white."""
"""Expand from center also works the same with the Ctrl key, after clicking the mouse button."""
"""Fixed aspect ratio is also the same. After clicking the mouse button, you get a perfect circle with aspect ratio 1 by 1 (1:1)."""
"""Now, let's come to the last tool I want to show you for today and that's the Free Select tool."""
"""When I select that tool, I see the same options here and also the keys work the same for Add, Replace, Subtract and Intersect."""
It has only two further options i.e Antialiasing and Feather edges with same functions.
"""Here, I get the Radius of the circle and I de-select it now."""
I select this lower part of the leaf to show you as example.
And I click into the image where I want to start the selection and draw a line and follow the border of the leaf.
"""So, now I have selected this area."""
I zoom into the image to do fine tuning.
"""And in my selection dialog, I select Add to the current selection and start adjusting the selection."""
The algorithm looks for the shortest way to the point where you started the selection.
"""For making the selection easy, I can use a Quick Mask."""
"""On the bottom left corner is the option, Toggle Quick Mask and I toggle that and you can see now my whole image is red."""
It is a bit confusing option because the area which I have selected and the area which is not selected are shown in red.
"""So, I go to the toggle and right clicking on it gives me Configure Colour and Opacity and here I can set a color, so I set it to blue."""
Now the area which is selected is Red and all the area is blue.
"""And now, I select a pen and start painting the selected area but before that I change the foreground and background colour  with the key ’X’."""
And now I start to paint.
"""And when I over-paint the border, I can paint with the background colour."""
"""For painting, I should select the right size of the brush."""
"""And when I untoggle the mask, you can see, here is the mistake in selection and here also."""
"""So, I select the toggle and correct the mistakes."""
Fixed.
"""So, the Quick Mask is an easy way to get a complicated selection right."""
You can use the Quick Mask selection as a tool.
You can change the opacity of the mask and now you can hardly see the parts which are not selected.
50% opacity is the right amount in most of the cases.
You can choose a colour of your choice for the unselected areas.
There is another option here called Mask Selected Areas.
It has just the opposite effect of the Quick Mask.
"""So now, the selected area is painted blue and this looks better in this case here."""
"""And when you de-select the Quick Mask, you can see your selection."""
"""So now, let's pretend that I have made a perfect selection here and I want to save the selection for the next time to work and don't want to loose it."""
Just go to Select and Save to Channel because selections are basically channels.
I save it as Mask1 and it will be stored with the ’XCF’ file.
"""So now, I can de-select everything with Shift + Ctrl + A."""
"""Select another part and when I go back to my selection here, I can add to the selection or subtract from selection or even intersect with selection and my selection is back here."""
"""So, if you want to save that, just go to Select and Save to Channel. Good Bye."""
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Linux File System.
I am using Linux Operating system.
We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands.
"""If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial on the following website http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Also note that linux is case sensitive.
All the commands used in this tutorial are in lower case unless otherwise mentioned.
"""In Linux, almost everything is a file."""
"""So, what is a file? In real life, we know that a file is where we store our documents and papers."""
"""Similarly, in Linux a file is a container for storing information."""
"""Next, what is a directory?"""
A directory can be understood as a collection of files and other (sub)directories.
A directory helps us in organizing our files in a systematic manner.
This is like what we call folders in Windows.
It allows different users to have their own directories with their files which others cannot access or modify.
"""Also, if there are no directories, all the files on the system need to have unique names which would be very difficult to maintain."""
These definitions of files and directories are good to get a general feel about them; they are not entirely accurate.
"""As well as its contents, a file has a name and some properties or “administrative information” that is, the file’s creation/modification date and its permissions."""
"""Thus,  properties are stored in the file’s inode- a special block of data in the file system that also contains the length of the file and where on the disk it’s stored."""
The system uses the number of the file’s inode ; the directory structure just names the file for our benefit as it's easier for us to remember names than larger numbers.
"""Contrary to its oversimplified definition, a directory does not actually store other files, it itself is a file that holds the inode numbers and names of other files."""
"""In fact, in Linux there are three kinds of files:"""
"""Regular Files or Ordinary files: It contains only data, as a stream of characters."""
Directories: As we just saw in the previous slides.
Device Files: All hardware devices and peripherals are represented as files in Linux.
"""A CD, a Hard disk or even an usb stick, everything is a file in Linux. But why is this so? This helps to read and write these devices in a way similar to that for ordinary files."""
"""All files in Linux are related. In short, all form a family much like we do."""
"""A directory containing say- some files and sub-directories, will have a parent – child relationship with each other. This gives rise to the Linux File System Tree."""
At the top is the root( denoted by a frontslash /). It contains all the other files and directories.
"""This also helps in easy navigation from one file or directory to other, if we know the correct path."""
"""As we work with a Linux file system, it seems that we are moving along this tree."""
One command and there you are... teleported from one place to other.
"""Sounds interesting!! Indeed it is, as we will see."""
"""When we login into the Linux system, we are by default in a home directory."""
"""Now, switch to the terminal."""
"""To see the home directory , type at the command prompt: echo space dollar H-O-M-E in capital and press Enter."""
This gives the path name of our home directory.
We can move around from one directory to other.
"""But, any time we can be in one directory and this directory is known as the current directory or working directory."""
The pwd command helps us to see the current directory. pwd stands for present working directory.
"""Type at the command prompt pwd and press Enter. Now, this is our present working directory."""
We have said that we can move from one directory to other.
But how do we do so? We have the cd command for this purpose.
You have to type the command cd followed by the path name of the directory you want to move to.
Let's again see our current directory by typing pwd at the command prompt and press Enter.
"""So, now we are placed in this directory."""
"""Now, say we want to move to slash usr directory. So, type: cd space slash usr. Remember, here slash in linux means front-slash and press Enter."""
Now lets see our current directory. Type pwd and press Enter.
"""Yes, we have moved to slash usr directory."""
"""The problem here is, the path names can be very long; this is because these are Absolute Path names that enlist the entire path, starting from the root directory."""
"""Instead, we may use Relative path names that begin from the current directory."""
"""Here, we need to know two special characters. dot that represent the current directory and dot dot that represent the parent directory of the current directory."""
"""Now, let us have a brief session on cd command."""
"""The command cd, without any argument, is used to move back to the home directory."""
Type at the command prompt cd and press Enter.
Now check our current directory by the pwd command.
"""So, now we are back in our home directory- /home/gnuhata [slash home slash gnuhata]."""
"""Now, let us move to music directory. Type at the command prompt cd space Music (M in capital) slash and press Enter."""
"""Now check our current directory by the pwd command. pwd and press enter. See, we have moved  /home/gnuhata/Music."""
"""Let us go to the parent directory of Music. For that, you have to use cd command with dot dot."""
Type at the command prompt: cd space dot dot and press Enter.
Now check our present directory by typing pwd. We are again in /home/gnuhata.
"""Now, let's try to move to a sub-directory of the current directory using dot."""
Type at the command prompt: cd space dot slash Documents (D in capital) slash. Press Enter.
Check our current directory by typing pwd. We are at-  /home/gnuhata/Documents.
Let me clear the screen by pressing control L. So you can see clearly.
"""To go back to our home directory by cd command, type cd and press Enter."""
Again check our current directory by pwd command. We are back to /home/gnuhata.
We can combine any number of dot dot separated by slash in a relative path.
"""In this slide, we can see the file system hierarchy. Root or slash is at the top. home and bin are two sub-directories under root. username , here the directory named gnuhata, is a sub-directory under home."""
"""So, now we are in /home/gnuhata. Now, how can we go to the bin directory?"""
Type at the command prompt: cd space dot dot slash dot dot slash bin and press Enter.
Check our current directory by the command pwd.  We are at /bin (slash bin).
"""The first """".."""" (dot dot) takes us from /home/gnuhata (slash home slash gnuhata) to /home (slash home)."""
"""The next, takes us from slash home to root."""
"""Now from root or slash, we have moved to /bin directory."""
Go back to our home directory by the command cd.
"""To create a directory, we use the mkdir command."""
You have to type the command and the name of directory to be created and a directory would be created under the current directory.
"""To create a directory named testdir, type the command: mkdir space testdir and press Enter."""
This creates the testdir directory successfully.
"""Note that, there is no explicit notification of successful directory creation or removal."""
"""If you do not get any error message, it denotes successful execution."""
We can also use the relative or absolute path name to create a directory anywhere in the tree provided we have the permission to do so and a directory by that name does not already exist.
This process can be used for making multiple directories or even a hierarchy of directories.
Type: mkdir space test1 space test2 and press Enter. This will make two directories named test1 and test2 under the present directory.
"""Type: """"'mkdir space testtree space testtree slash test3'""""."""
This will make a directory testtree and another directory test3 which is a sub-directory under testtree.
"""So, we have created four directories namely testdir, test1, test2 and testtree in the current directory, out of which first three are empty and the last one contains a sub-directory namely test3."""
Similar to the mkdir command is the rmdir command which is used for removing a directory or directories.
The command rmdir space test1 removes the test1 directory successfully.
"""A directory can be removed only if you are its owner, your current directory is hierarchically above the directory to be removed and the directory is empty."""
"""Now type at the command prompt: '""""cd space testtree slash test3""""'."""
"""So, we are now in test3 directory which is a sub-directory under testtree."""
Let's try to remove the testdir directory by typing the command rmdir space testdir. Press Enter.
We see it can't be done because the current directory is not hierarchically above the directory to be removed.
"""So, we have to go to the directory which is hierarchically above testdir directory."""
"""Type: """"'cd space dot dot""""' and press Enter."""
"""Now, go back to our parent directory by typing the command """"'cd space dot dot'""""."""
"""Now, again try the previous command."""
"""Type: """"rmdir space testdir"""". Press Enter."""
"""The testdir directory is successfully deleted. Note that, testdir directory was also empty."""
"""Multiple directories or a hierarchy of directories can be removed at once. So, try to delete the testtree directory along with its sub-directory test3."""
Type at the command prompt: rmdir space testtree space testtree slash test3 press Enter.
"""See, it is giving the error message that 'testree' directory cannot be removed because 'testtree' is not empty."""
But one thing which you may miss is that testtree slash test3 has been deleted as it was empty.
"""To check that, type at the command prompt: cd space testtree and press Enter."""
"""Now, type ls and press Enter. See, the directory contains nothing. So, 'test3' was deleted."""
"""So, in this linux tutorial we have learnt about Linux Files and directories and how to work with Linux Directories. See them, move between them, make them, remove them."""
"""This brings me to the end of this tutorial. Spoken Tutorials are part of the """"Talk to a Teacher"""" project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""

Hi everyone. Welcome to the tutorial on Integrating an Applet in a Web Application.
The application that you build in this tutorial shows you how to build and deploy applets in the Netbeans IDE.
"""If this is the first time you are using Netbeans, please view the tutorial -"""
Introduction to Netbeans to get started with the IDE.
"""Also, view the tutorials Developing Web Applications and Designing GUIs on Netbeans"""
to get familiarized with the IDE.
All the above tutorials can be viewed on the Spoken Tutorial website.
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System Ubuntu version 11.04 and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1."""
"""In this tutorial, we will:"""
Create an Applet
Run the Applet and
Embed the applet in a web application.
Let us now launch the IDE to create our project.
Go to  File > New Project and create a Java Class Library .
Click Next.
Give your Project a name.
"""I will name my project as  """"SampleApplet""""."""
Set the  Location to any directory on your system.
"""And, click Finish to create your project."""
Let us next create the  Applet Source File.
"""Right-Click on the """"SampleApplet"""" project node"""
and choose Properties to open the Properties window.
Select the desired Source or Binary Format for the project.
This is to make sure if the correct version of the JDK has been chosen.
"""For example- if you choose the latest version of JDK,"""
then the applet might not run on machines that have an older version of the Java browser plugin.
I will select the latest version of JDK since my browser supports the latest version of the java browser plugin.
Click on OK.
Right-Click again on the SampleApplet project node
and select New > Applet.
"""If you do not find the Applet option in this contextual menu, click on Other."""
"""Under Categories, select Java."""
"""And under File Types, select Applet to create an Applet."""
"""Give the Class name as """"Sample"""" and the Package as """"org.me.hello""""."""
Click Finish.
The IDE creates the applet source file in the specified package.
You can expand the Source Packages node in the Projects window to see this.
The Applet source file opens in the Source editor.
Let us now define our applet class.
I have the code for a simple applet
"""that sets the background color to cyan,"""
the foreground color to red
and displays a message that illustrates the order in which the methods in the applet
"""i.e. the init() method, the start() method, and the paint() methods are called when the applet starts up."""
I will now copy the entire code on my clipboard and paste it over the existing code in the IDE.
Right-Click on the Sample.java file in the Projects window
and choose Run File from the contextual menu.
"""The Sample.html launcher file, with the applet embedded, is created in the build folder"""
which you can see in the Files window.
Sample dot html file.
The Applet is also  launched in the Applet viewer
with the message displayed across the screen.
Let me close the applet viewer.
"""And, let us next embed the Applet in a web-application"""
so that we can make the applet available to the user.
"""To do so, we create a web-application."""
"""Under Categories,  select java web and under Projects, select Web Application"""
and click Next.
"""We will name our Project as """"HelloSampleApplet"""" and"""
click Next.
See if the correct server is selected and click Finish to create your project.
"""Note that when we add the Java project SampleApplet to the web project HelloSampleApplet,"""
we enable the IDE to build the applet whenever we build this web application.
"""Therefore, when we modify the Sample dot java applet ,"""
the IDE builds a new version of the applet whenever this  is built.
"""Now, in the Projects window, right-click on the HelloSampleApplet project node"""
and click on Properties.
Our applet is in a Java project.
"""To add the Jar file, select the Packaging option from the menu on the left side of the window."""
Click on Add Project and select the java project that contains the Applet class.
"""In this case, it is SampleApplet."""
Click on Add Project Jar Files.
The JAR file containing the applet source file is now listed in the table.
Click on OK.
"""And, let us build the HelloSampleApplet project now by right-clicking on it in the Projects window"""
and selecting Clean and Build option.
"""Now, when this project is built, the applets Jar file is generated in the original SampleApplet project."""
"""Go to the Files window, expand the HelloSampleApplet project node."""
"""Under build and web folder,"""
you can see that the jar file has been added.
"""Now, let us next embed the applet in a HTML file."""
"""Go back to the Projects window, right-click on the HelloSampleApplet project node,"""
choose New and select the HTML file option.
"""If you cannot find the HTML option in this contextual menu,"""
click on Other.
Select Web  under Categories and select HTML under  File Types and click Next.
Give your Html file a name.
"""I will name the file as """"MyApplet"""" and click on Finish."""
The next step is to enter the applet tag in between the 'body' tags in MyApplet dot html file.
I have the applet code here.
"""Let me copy it onto my clipboard and paste it in between the body tags, in the html file."""
The next step is to run the html file.
Right-click on MyApplet dot html in the Projects window and select Run File.
The server deploys the html file in the IDE's default browser.
"""Now, the server has deployed the html file in the IDE's default browser."""
You can see the message displayed across the screen.
Now to the assignment-
"""As your assignment, create another simple banner applet in the IDE"""
where the applet scrolls a message across the applet's window.
Embed your applet in a web-application
and add JAR files to the web project and
finally create and run the HTML file.
I have created my own moving banner applet.
Let me open the project and run it.
You can see that the applet has opened with the message scrolling across the window.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Add a Budget and allocate Funds.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to- Add a Budget,  Make a duplicate Budget and Allocate Funds."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04 and Koha version 16.05"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have Koha installed on your system."""
You should also have Admin access in Koha.
Please refer to the Koha spoken tutorial series on this website for more details.
Let us go ahead and learn how to add a Budget.
"""Before we begin, let us understand what are Budgets. Budgets are used for tracking accounting values related to Acquisitions."""
A Budget must be defined before a fund can be created.
For example-  Create a Budget for the current year 2017.
"""Split it into Funds for different areas such as Books, Journals and/or  Databases."""
"""Please note,Budgets can either be created - from scratch or by duplicating any of the previous years’ Budget"""
"""or, by duplicating the immediate previous year’s Budget or, by closing the immediate previous year’s Budget."""
"""As mentioned in earlier tutorials, login with the Superlibrarian username Bella and her password."""
On the 'Koha' Home page click on Acquisitions.
"""From  the options on the left side, click on Budgets."""
"""Now, click on the tab New budget."""
"""First, we have to choose the time period for this Budget."""
"""Budget can be created for- an Academic year, Fiscal year or  a Quarter year etc."""
I will create the Budget for a Fiscal year.
Then choose the Start and End dates.
I will select- Start date: as 04/01/2016 (MM/DD/YYYY) End date: as 03/31/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY)
Next we have to give a description for our Budget.
"""This will help us to identify it later, at the time of ordering."""
"""Here, I will type: Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I."""
"""In the Amount box, we need to enter the amount for this particular Budget."""
"""This is the total amount of money we are planning to spend, in the given period,  for the Spoken Tutorial Library."""
Note that this field accepts only numerals and decimals.
Special characters and symbols are not allowed.
"""The Amount we enter, has to be as per the Budget approved for that library."""
"""Here, I will add Rs. 5,00,000/- as the Amount."""
"""Next, click on Make a budget active."""
"""On doing so, the budget becomes usable when placing orders in the Acquisitions module."""
"""And this remains so, even if the order is placed after the Budget End date."""
This will also allow us to record orders that were placed in the previous year’s Budget.
Next is the check-box for Lock budget
which means Funds cannot be modified later by the library staff.
I will leave this check-box blank.
"""After all the entries are done, click on the Save button at the bottom of the page."""
A new page Budgets administration opens up.
"""Here, we can see the details that were added earlier in the +New Budget page."""
The details visible on this page are -
"""description under the tab Budget name, Start date:, End date:, Total amount:, Actions:."""
"""We can also edit, delete or duplicate a particular Budget as required."""
"""To do so, click on the tab Actions located at the extreme right of that Budget name."""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Strings  in C and C++.
In this tutorial we will learn:
What is a string.
Declaration of a string.
Initialization of a string.
Few examples on string.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04 gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 ."
Let us start with the introduction to strings.
String is a sequence of characters that is treated as a single data item.
Size of string = length of string + 1.
Let me tell you how to declare a string.
The syntax for this is
"""char, name of string and size."""
"""char is the data type, name of the string is the string name, and we can give the size here."""
Eg: here we have declared a character string names with size 10.
Now we will see an example.
"""I have already typed the program,  I will open it."""
Note that our file name is string.c
"""In this program, we will take a string as an input from the user and print it."""
Let me explain the code now.
These are our header files.
"""Here string.h includes the declarations, functions, constants of string handling utilities."""
"""Whenever we work on string functions, we should include this header file."""
This is our main() function.
Here we are declaring the string strname with size  30.
Here we are accepting a string from the user.
"""To read a string, we can use scanf() function with format specifier %s."""
We are using the caret sign and  to include the spaces with the string.
Then we print the string.
And this is our return statement.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute the program.
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space string.c space -o space str and press Enter ."
"""To execute, type ./str  (dot slash str)."""
Now press Enter.
Here it is displayed as Enter the string .
"""I will type """"Talk To A Teacher""""."""
The output is displayed as  The string is Talk To A Teacher.
Now let us switch back to our slides.
Until now we discussed about the declaration of a string.
Now we are going to discuss how to initialize the string.
"""The syntax for this is,"""
char var_name[size] = “string”;
"""Eg: Here we have declared a character string  “names” with size 10 and the string is “Priya”"""""""
"""Another syntax is,"""
"""char var_name[ ] = {'S', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g'}  within single quotes."""
"""eg: char names[10] = {'P', 'r', 'i', 'y', 'a'}  in single quotes."""
Let me show you how to use the first syntax with an example.
Switch back to our Editor. We will use the same example.
"""First, press shift, ctrl and s keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with the name stringinitialize.
We are going to initialize the string.
"""Hence, at the 5th line, type"""
"""Now, click on Save ."""
"""Now remove these two lines, as we are only going to print the string."""
Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type gcc space stringinitialize.c space -o space str2"
Here we have str2 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter str for the file string.c.
Now press Enter.
"""To execute, type ./str2"""
"""The output is displayed as  """"The string is Spoken-Tutorial""""."""
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across .
Come back to our program.
"""Suppose, here we type the spelling of string as sting."""
Now click on Save.
Let us execute.Come back to our terminal.
Now compile as before.
We see an fatal error.
sting.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
Come back to our program.
This is because the compiler is not able to find the header file with the name sting.h .
Hence it is giving an error.
Let us fix the error.
Type r here.
Now click on Save. Let us execute again.
Come back to our terminal.
"""Compile as before, execute as before."""
"""Yes, it is working!"""
"""Now, let us see another common error."""
Come back to our program.
"""Suppose, here I will type int in place of char."""
"""Now, click on Save .Let us see what happens."""
Come back to our terminal.
Let me clear the prompt.
Compile as before.
We see an error.
Wide character array initialized from non-wide string .
format %s expects argument of type 'char' but  argument 2 has type 'int' .
This is because we used  %s as the format specifier for string.
And we are initializing it with an integer data type.
Let us fix the error.
Type char here.
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
"""Compile as before, execute as before."""
"""Yes, it is working!"""
Now we will see how to execute the same program in C++.
Let me open our file string.c.
We will edit the code here.
"""First, press shift, ctrl and S keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with an extension .cpp (dot cpp).
and click on Save.
Now we will change the header file as  iostream.
Include the using statement.
Now we will delete this declaration.
And will declare a string variable.
Type string space strname and a semicolon.
Click on Save.
Replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
Delete the closing bracket here.
"""Delete the scanf statement and type getline opening bracket closing bracket, within the brackets type (cin, strname) ."""
"""At the end, type a semicolon."""
"""Now again, replace the printf statement with the cout statement."""
Delete the format specifier and  .
Now delete the comma.
"""Type two opening angle brackets, delete the bracket here."""
Type two opening angle brackets and within the double quotes type  .
And click on Save.
Here we have declared a string variable 'strname' .
"""Since we do not use the format specifier in C++, the compiler should know that 'strname' is a string variable."""
Here we use getline to extract the characters from the input sequence.
It stores them as a string.
Now let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space string.cpp space -o space str3 and press Enter."
"""To execute, type ./str3 (dot slash str3)."""
Press Enter. It is displayed as Enter the string.
I will enter as Talk To A Teacher .
Now press Enter.
"The output is displayed as ""The string is Talk To A Teacher"""
We can see that the output is similar to our C code.
Now come back to our slides. Let us summarize.
In this tutorial we learnt:
Strings and Declaration of a string
eg: char strname[30]
"Initialization of a string eg: char strname[30] = ""Talk To A Teacher"""
"As an assignment, write a program to print a string using the 2nd syntax."

Hello everyone.Welcome to this tutorial on Writing Sequence Files.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn: * How to create Sequence Record Objects"""
Write sequences files
Convert between file formats
"""And, sort records in a file by length."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with"""
undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics
and basic Python programming.
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: * Ubuntu OS version 14.10"""
Python version 2.7.8
Ipython interpretor version 2.3.0 and * Biopython version 1.64.
We have earlier learnt about parse and read functions to read contents of a file.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to use write function to write sequences to a file."""
"""And, use Convert function for inter-conversion between various file formats."""
Let me now demonstrate how to use write function.
Here is a text file with a protein sequence.
The sequence shown here is insulin protein.
The file also has information such as GI accession number and also description.
We will now create a file for this sequence in FASTA format.
The first step is to create sequence record object.
More information about Sequence Record Objects:
It is the basic data type for the sequence input/output interface.
"""In sequence record object, a sequence is associated with higher level features such as identifiers and descriptions."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and t keys simultaneously ."""
"""At the prompt, type: ipython, press Enter."""
"""At the prompt, type the following lines:"""
from Bio dot Seq module import Seq class.
from Bio dot SeqRecord module import Sequence Record class
"""Next, from Bio dot Alphabet module import generic protein class."""
"""Next, I will save the sequence record object in a variable record1."""
"""Copy the sequence, id and description from the text file and paste it in the respective lines on the terminal."""
Press Enter.
"""To view the output, type: record1."""
Press Enter.
The output shows the insulin protein sequence as sequence record object.
It shows the sequence along with id and description.
We will use write function to convert the above sequence record object to a FASTA file.
Import SeqIO module from Bio package.
"""Next, type the command line with a write function to convert the sequence object to FASTA file."""
The write function takes 3 arguments.
The first one is the variable storing the sequence record object.
The second is the file name to write the FASTA file.
The third is the file format to write. Press Enter.
"""The Output shows one, that is, we have converted one sequence record object to a FASTA file."""
"""The file in FASTA format is saved in the home folder as """"example.fasta""""."""
"""Let me warn you,the output will over-write any pre-existing file of the same name."""
"""To view the file, navigate to the file in the home folder."""
Open this file in a text editor.
The protein sequence is now in FASTA format.
Close the text editor.
Many bioinformatics tools take different input file formats.
"""So, sometimes there is a need to inter-convert between sequence file formats."""
We can do file conversions using convert function in SeqIO module.
"""For demonstration, I will convert a GenBank file to a FASTA file."""
Have a GenBank file in my home folder.
Let me open this in a text editor.
The file contains HIV genome in GenBank format.
"""This GenBank file has descriptions of all the genes in the genome, in the first part of the file."""
It is followed by a complete genome sequence.
Close the text editor. Type the following lines on the terminal.
Here the convert function converts the complete genome sequence present in the GenBank file to FASTA file. Press Enter.
The new file in the FASTA format is now saved as HIV.fasta in the home folder.
Navigate to the file and open in the text editor.
"""Even though we can convert the file formats easily using convert function, it has limitations."""
Writing some formats requires information which other file formats don’t contain.
"""For example: We can convert a GenBank file to a FASTA file, we can't do the reverse."""
"""Similarly, we can turn a FASTQ file into a FASTA file but can’t do the reverse."""
"""For more information regarding convert function, type the help command."""
Press 'q' on the key board to get back to the prompt.
We can also extract individual genes from the HIV genome in GenBank format.
These individual genes can be saved in FASTA or any other formats.
"""For this, type the following code at the prompt."""
"""This code will write all individual CDS gene sequences, their ids and name of the gene in a file."""
The file is saved as “HIV_geneseq.fasta” in your home folder. Press Enter.
"""Using Biopython tools, we can sort the records in a file by length."""
"""Here, I have opened a FASTA file “hemoglobin.fasta” which has six records."""
Each record is of a different length.
Type the following lines to arrange the longest record first.
"""The new file with the sorted sequences will be saved as """"sorted_hemoglobin.fasta"""" in your home folder."""
"""For short records first, reverse the arguments in the records.sort command line."""
"""Let's summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt :* to create Sequence Record Objects"""
Write sequence files using write function of Sequence Input/Output module.
Convert between sequence file formats using convert function.
"""And, sort records in a file by length."""
For the assignment:
"""Extract the gene """"HIV1gp3"""" at positions 4587 to 5165 from the genomic sequence of HIV."""
The file “HIV.gb” is included in the code files of this tutorial.
Your completed assignment will have the following code.

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on  Desktop Customization in Ubuntu Linux 16.04 operating system.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the Launcher and how to: remove and add applications in the Launcher,"""
"""Use multiple Desktops, change the theme of the Desktop,"""
"""internet connectivity,  Sound settings,"""
Time and Date settings  and switch to other user accounts.
"""For this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System."""
Let's begin with the Launcher.
Launcher  is the default left-side panel in the Ubuntu Linux Desktop which has some default applications.
The Launcher makes it easy to access frequently used applications.
"""So, we can launch a program by clicking on its desktop shortcut on the Launcher."""
"""By default, the Launcher has some applications."""
Let us learn to customize the Launcher based on our requirements.
"""For my regular work, I need applications like Terminal, LibreOffice Writer, gedit and so on."""
Let's add these applications to the Launcher.
"""Before doing that, I will remove some of the applications which I don't want."""
"""Say, I wish to remove the Amazon application from the Launcher."""
"""Go to the Amazon application icon, then right-click and select Unlock from Launcher."""
You can see that the Amazon application icon has been removed from the Launcher.
"""In the same way, we can remove all the shortcuts which we do not use frequently."""
"""I have removed some applications from the Launcher, as you can see here."""
"""Now, I will add the Terminal shortcut to the Launcher."""
"""Click on Dash home, at the top of the Launcher."""
"""In the search bar, type “terminal”. Click on the Terminal icon to open it."""
You can see the Terminal icon on the Launcher.
"""To fix the Terminal icon on the Launcher, first right-click on it. Then select Lock to Launcher."""
"""Another way to fix application shortcuts on the Launcher, is by dragging and dropping. I will demonstrate this now."""
"""Open Dash Home and in the search bar, type gedit."""
Drag the gedit  icon onto the Launcher.
"""Now, drop the gedit icon on the Launcher. You can see the gedit shortcut is now added to the Launcher."""
This is how we can add shortcuts on the Launcher.
The next important feature in Ubuntu Linux OS is multiple workspace or Desktop.
Sometimes we may be working on multiple applications
and we may find it difficult to switch from one application to another.
"""To make it more convenient, we can use Workspace Switcher."""
Let’s come back to the Desktop.
"""In Ubuntu 16.04,  multiple workspaces won’t appear by default."""
"""To enable it, click on the System Settings, and then on Appearance."""
"""In the Appearance window, click on Behavior tab."""
"""Here, select Enable workspaces option. This will enable the multiple workspaces icon on the Launcher."""
Close this window.
"""On the Launcher, locate Workspace Switcher icon and click on it."""
It shows 4 quadrants with 4 Desktops.
"""By default, the top-left Desktop is selected."""
That is the Desktop in which we are currently working.
"""Now, let’s select the second Desktop by double-clicking on it."""
I will open the terminal here by clicking on the terminal icon in the Launcher.
"""Now, click on the Workspace Switcher again."""
You can see the terminal on the second Workspace and our Desktop on the first.
"""In this way, you can work on multiple Desktops."""
Let’s come back to the first Desktop now.
Trash is another important icon on the Launcher.
"""Trash contains all the deleted files and folders. In case we delete a file accidentally, we can restore it from Trash."""
"""To demonstrate this, I will delete Hello.txt which is on my Desktop."""
Right-click on the file and click on the option Move to Trash.
"""To restore it, just click on the Trash icon in the Launcher. The Trash folder opens."""
"""Select the file, right-click on it and click on Restore option."""
Close the Trash folder window and come back to the Desktop.
"""We can see the file which we deleted earlier, is now restored."""
"""To delete a file permanently from your system, first select it and then press Shift+Delete keys."""
A dialog box is asking “Are you sure you want to permanently delete Hello.txt?” Click on the Delete button.
Click on the Trash icon once again.
"""We cannot find the file in the Trash folder, as it is permanently deleted from our system."""
Aren't you bored of seeing the same theme of the Desktop? Let's change it.
"""Go to the Launcher and select System settings, and then click on Appearance."""
The Appearance window opens up.
"""Here, under Themes tab, we have many pre-installed themes."""
Play with these themes as per your preference.
"""As soon as you click on any one, you can see that changes get applied on the Desktop."""
Click on the tiny X icon to close the window.
"""Now, we'll see some icons available at the top right corner of the Desktop."""
First one is Internet connectivity.
Connection is established if you are connected to any Lan or Wifi network.
You can see these over here.
You can select the network which you have access to.
"""To Enable or Disable the network, check or uncheck the Enable Networking option."""
We can also edit the networks using Edit Connections option.
Next icon is that of Sound.
You can see a slider here.
"""This helps us to increase or decrease the audio level, as per our choice."""
We can further adjust the sound level of our system by clicking on Sound Settings. Explore the settings in this window on your own.
"""Next icon is Time & Date. If we click on this icon, the calendar opens up."""
"""We can see the current date, month and year."""
"""Arrow buttons allow us to move to other months and years, as per our choice."""
We can edit the date and time by clicking on Time & Date Settings.
Explore this option further on your own.
"""Next, click on the wheel or Power icon."""
Here we can see some shortcut options along with Log Out and Shut Down options.
We can also see all the user accounts available in our system.
We can switch to whichever user account we wish to by clicking on that particular user.
With this we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarise.

"""The script for this tutorial has been contributed by the Spoken Tutorial team."
Welcome to this  spoken tutorial on Logical Operators in Java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn about the logical operators."""
How to check for multiple expressions using logical operators and  how to override precedence using parentheses.
"""For this tutorial we are using: Ubuntu 11.10,  JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge on relational operators in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown."""
Logical operators are used to check for multiple conditions.
Here is a list of the available logical operators in Java.
"""and, or, not. We shall look into each of them in detail. Switch to Eclipse."""
"""Here, we have the 'Eclipse IDE' and  the skeleton required for the rest of the code."""
We have created a class LogicalOperators and added the main method.
Let us create some variables.
boolean b ;
We shall store the result of conditions in 'b';
int age is equal to 11;
int weight is equal to 42;
We have the age and weight of a person.
We shall check if the person is below 18yrs of age and is at least 40kgs.
Let us see how to do so.
b is equal to age less than 18 ampersand ampersand weight greater than equal to 40;
This statement has two expressions and a double ampersand symbol in between.
It checks if age is less than 18 and also if weight is greater than or equal to 40.
This operation is called the and operation.
Let us now print the value of 'b'.
System dot out dot println(b);
Save and Run .
"""As we can see, the output is true because both the conditions are satisfied."""
"""Now, let us change the weight so that one condition is not satisfied and re-run the code."""
Change 42 to 32.
Save and Run.
The output now is false.
This is because the condition age less than 18 is  satisfied
but the condition  weight  greater than or equal to 40 is not satisfied.
The AND operation requires both the conditions to be true for the result to be true.
Therefore we get false as our output.
"""This way, using a  double ampersand symbol we can perform  an AND operation."""
Let's say we have age and weight and it is enough if only one of the conditions is satisfied.
"""In other words, we need to see if the first condition  or the second condition is true."""
It is done using the OR operation.
Let us first remove the earlier condition.
And  type:
age less than or equal to 15 pipe pipe weight less than or equal to 30
There are two conditions and a double pipe symbol in between.
This statement checks if at least one of the given two conditions is satisfied.
Let us run the code to see the output. Save and run.
We see that the output is true.
This is because an OR operation does not need both the conditions to be true like the AND operation.
It needs at least one condition to be true.
"""So, although the condition for weight is not satisfied, since the condition for age is satisfied"""
we get the output as true.
"""Now, let us change the age in  such a way that both the conditions are false and see the result."""
change 11 to 17.
Now the output is false because both the conditions are not satisfied.
"""This way, we use a double PIPE symbol to do an OR operation."""
"""Now, let us say we need to check for people who are older than 15 and with weight more than 30kilos."""
"""In other words, we need to check the exact opposite of the condition we just did."""
"""In such situations, we use the NOT operation."""
"""First, enclose the condition in parentheses."""
And  add an exclamation mark before the condition.
"""By using an exclamation mark, we check for the exact opposite of the condition inside the parentheses."""
"""Since the earlier output was false, now it must be   true. Let us see."""
"""As we can see, the output is the opposite of earlier one."""
"""This way, by using the exclamation mark we perform the NOT operation. Now, let us say we want people  younger than 15."""
Or people younger than 18  and  lighter than 40kilos.
Let us see how would we go about this condition.
Remove the earlier condition and type:
age less than 15
OR age less than 18
AND weight less than 40;
"""As we can see, the condition itself is confusing."""
"""Moreover, we do not know if the OR operation will be performed first or the AND operation."""
It depends on the precedence of operators.
"""In such situations, we use parentheses to overwrite the precedence and also make the condition clear."""
So let us add the parentheses.
"""Let us run the code,  save, run."""
"""Now, although the first condition which is age less than 15 is not satisfied,"""
the second condition which is
age less than 18 and weight less than 40 is satisfied.
"""Therefore, the output is true."""
"""As a rule, use parentheses to avoid ambiguity and make the expressions clear."""
And  this is how we use the logical operators to check for multiple conditions.
This brings us to the end of the tutorial.
"""We have learnt about logical operators, how to check for multiple expressions using logical operators and"""
how to override the precedence using parentheses.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial,"""
find out if the two expressions shown are equivalent?

Welcome to Meet the GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
The GIMP is a very powerful image manipulation program.
"""In this first tutorial, I want to give  you a small tour of GIMP and its features."""
I will briefly demonstrate you how to prepare an image for the web.
I will give detailed explanation in future tutorials.
"""To open an image, I will just drag and drop the image on to the tool box."""
And here it is!
Let’s have a look at this image.
I want to make this image ready for the web.
Let's see what I can do with it.
"""First, the image is tilted; so I have to rotate it a bit."""
Then I want to crop it to remove this part - the back of a person.
The 3rd thing I want to do is to bring in more colors and contrast.
I also want to re-size the image because now its nearly 4000 pixels wide which is far too much.
And then I want to sharpen it and save it as a JPEG image.
Let’s start with rotating.
I zoom into the part of the image where it is most obvious that the image is tilted. You can see it here.
"""By the way, you can move around in the image by pressing Space and just moving the cursor."""
And now I choose the Rotate tool by clicking here.
"""In the Rotate tool, there are some options set by default, to values suited for graphical work and not for photographic work."""
"""So, here Direction is set to Normal (Forward) but I will set it to Corrective (Backward)."""
"""I check if I have the best Interpolation. So, that's fine."""
"""And in the Preview,  I choose Grid instead of the Image."""
I shall increase the no. of grid lines by moving the slider. You will see it soon.
"""Now I will click on the image and get a grid, overlaid on the image."""
This grid is straight.
And I can rotate it and GIMP will rotate the image in the same direction in the Corrective mode so that the grid is straight again.
Let me demonstrate. I will rotate the grid like this.
I will check the other part of the image to make sure.
Looks good to me.
"""Now, I will click on the Rotate button."""
This will take some time since the image is about 10 mega-pixels.
And it is done! The image has rotated.
Let's have a look at the whole picture. Shift + Ctrl + E brings us back to the image.
Next step is Cropping.
I chose the Crop tool by clicking here.
I want to keep the aspect ratio of the image as 3:2.
"""For that, I check Fixed Aspect ratio here and type in 3:2."""
Just clicking to come out of that box.
"""And now, I can start cropping."""
I want to include the feet of this person here but exclude this part of the image.
"""So, I start here at this point and pressing the left mouse button, I drag upward towards the left to select the area."""
Note that the aspect ratio is constant.
And now I have to decide how far to drag.
I think this is quite good.
Let’s check the borders.
We have excluded this part. There is a person sitting here.
I think there is enough room here for the person to be in the picture.
"""So, I will leave it that way since it looks nice."""
"""There are windows here, on the top."""
"""And there are enough of them in the image, to see them as windows."""
"""But I think there is not enough room around here, at the feet."""
"""So, I'll just click on the image, and drag it a bit down."""
I think this is good now.
But now there are not enough windows seen here and the person seated here is very near to the border.
"""So, lets make the image a bit larger."""
We are running into a problem hereC. Perhaps you can see it.
This happened during the rotation.
There is a small part here which is transparent now.
I don’t want to include that.
"""So, lets go back to Crop tool."""
I want a bit more room here; so I am dragging this up.
Not so far.
I think this is quite good.
Now just click on the image and here we have the cropped & rotated image.
Shift + Ctrl + E brings us back to the full view.
Next step is to boost the colors & contrast a bit.
"""There are several ways here. I could use the color levels - here it is, the curves or some sliders."""
But I will try doing this with Layers.
I simply make a copy of this layer here.
And change the Layers mode to Overlay.
"""And you can see, its a very strong effect. I don’t want to have it that much."""
"""So, I slide the Opacity slider down to a value where I think its looking good."""
Little more perhaps.
"""Ok, I think this is good enough."""
I can always change that unless I right-click the mouse here to go to the channel list and say 'Flatten image' or 'Merge visible layers'.
Then all the changes become permanent
except if I go into History here and go back and undo the history.
But we’ll cover that later.
Next step is Resizing.
I will click on the Image menu & select Scale Image option.
"""Here, I will just type in 800 pixels"""
and I get the value for the Height automatically.
"""When I unlock this link here, I could distort the image while re-sizing it."""
Interpolation. I think I will choose Cubic. I found that the highest layer here gives some art effects with brick buildings. Its strange and I will have to check that out.
"""Now, click on Scale."""
And we’ll look at the result.
Shift + Ctrl + E gets us the whole image.
"""And when I press 1, I get 100% zoom."""
Now we can look around in the image to see if we have any really disturbing or distracting stuff. But I personally think it worked out well.
Next step is Sharpening.
My lens is quite good and my camera too. But we have manipulated the image. So it has to be sharpened a bit.
I will select Filters
"""and click on Enhance and here is Sharpening. I could also use the Unsharp mask which is very powerful sharpening tool. But for now, Sharpening is enough."""
This tool has basically only one option which is the sharpness slider. It can be adjusted and its enough for such an image.
"""This is the unsharpened image and when I drag this slider, the image gets sharpened more and more. You get a very funny effect if you slide it too far."""
I think for this image this value is good.
The hair looks clearer now but here you can see some blending or distortion.
"""So, we will slide it down and this is better."""
I would like to go for soft effects rather than have any distortion in the image.
They are the proof that you have manipulated the image.
"""So, let's look at the result."""
It looks quite good.
And now the last step is Saving this image.
I will go to File and click on Save As and just change the original file extension ‘tif’ to ‘jpg’
and click on the Save button.
I get a warning that the JPEG can't handle images with multiple layers. Ok. So we have to export them.
I think 85%is a good standard value for this image.
So I have saved this image as JPEG image here.
You can look at it in full screen.
"""This is it. The first tutorial of Meet the GIMP. In future tutorials, I will cover topics like how to set up GIMP, how to draw, convert, etc. and tools and many more."""

"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Functions in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial we will learn,"""
What is a function
Syntax of a function
Significance of return statement
We will do this through examples.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using,"""
"""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 .
Let us start with the introduction to functions.
A function is a self-contained program executing a specific task.
Every program consists of one or more functions.
"""Once executed, the control will be returned back from where it was accessed."""
Let us see the syntax for function.
ret-type defines the type of data that the function returns.
fun_name defines the name of the function.
parameters is the list of variable names and their types.
We can specify an empty parameter list.
This is called as functions without arguments.
And this is called as functions with arguments.
Let us see a program using void.
I have already typed the program on the editor.
So I will open it.
Note that our file name is function.
And I have saved the file with the extension .c (dot c).
Let me explain the code.
This is our header file.
"""Before using any function, it must be defined."""
Here we have defined a function called add.
Note that add function is without any arguments.
And the return type is void.
There are two types of functions-
User-defined that is our add function and
Pre-defined that is printf and main function .
Here we have initialized a and b by assigning them values as 2 and 3.
Here we have declared a variable c.
Then we add the values of a and b.
The result is stored in c.
Then we print the result.
This is our main function.
Here we call the add function.
The addition operation will be performed and the result will be printed.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute the program.
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl,  Alt and T  keys simultaneously."""
"""To compile, type gcc  function dot c  hyphen o  fun."""
"""To execute, type ./fun (dot slash fun)."""
We see the output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 5 .
Now come back to our program.
Functions contain special identifiers called as parameters or arguments.
Let us see the same example with arguments.
I will change a few things here.
"""Type int add(int a, int b)"""
Here we have declared a function add.
int a and int b are the arguments of the function  add.
Let us delete this.No need to initialize a and b here.
Delete the printf statement.
Type int main()
Let us declare a variable sum here.
Type int sum;
"""Then type sum = add(5,4);"""
Here we call the add function.
Then we pass the parameters as 5 and 4.
5 will be stored in a and 4 will be stored in  b.
The addition operation will be performed.
Let us now print the result.
"""Hence type here printf(“Sum is %d”, sum);"""
"""Delete this, as we have already called the function above."""
Type return 0;
A non-void function must use a return statement that returns a value.
Click on Save.
Come back to our terminal.
Now compile the program as before.
Let us execute.
The output is displayed as Sum is 9 .
Now let us see how to execute the same program in C++.
Let me change a few things here.
"""First press Shift, Ctrl and S keys simultaneously."""
Now save the file with .cpp extension.
Click on Save. First we will change the header file as <iostream>
We will include the using statement here.
The function declaration is same in C++.
So there is no need to change anything here.
"""Now replace the printf statement with the  cout statement, as we use cout<< function to print a line in C++."""
We don't need the format specifier and  here.
Delete the comma.
"""Now, type two opening angle brackets."""
"""After sum , again type two opening angle brackets."""
"""Within double quotes, type backslash n."""
Delete this closing bracket.
Now Click on Save.
Let us compile the program.
Type g++ function dot cpp hyphen o fun1
"""Here we have fun1, this is because we don't want to overwrite the output file fun."""
Press Enter.
Type ./fun1
The output is displayed as: Sum is 9
Now we will see the common errors which we can come across.
"""Suppose here, we type x in  place of 4."""
I will retain the rest of the code as it is.
Let us compile the program.
We see an error at line no. 10.
'x' was not declared in this scope.
This is because 'x' is a character variable.
It was not declared anywhere.
And our add function has integer variable as an argument.
"""So, there is a mismatch in return type and return value."""
Let us fix the error.
Type 4 at line no. 10.
Let us execute again.
Compile the program as before.
Yes! It is working.
Now we will see another common error which we can come across.
Suppose here we pass only one parameter.
Delete 4. Click on Save.
Switch to the terminal.
Let us compile.We see an error at line no 10.
"""too few arguments to function 'int add (int, int)'"""
Switch back to our program.
You can see here we have two parameters
int a and int b.
And here we are passing only one parameter.
Hence it is giving an error.
Let us fix the error.
Type 4.
Click on Save .
Let us execute again.
Come back to our slides.
"""To summarize, in this tutorial we have learnt -"""
function Syntax of function
function without arguments
Eg- void add()
Function with arguments
"""Eg- int add(int a, int b)"""
As an assignment- Write a program to calculate the square of a number.

Thank You for joining.
Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Database and validation.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:"""
Interact with database and
Validate the fields.
Here we are using:Ubuntu Version 12.04
Netbeans IDE 7.3
JDK 1.7
Firefox web-browser 21.0
You can use any web-browser of your choice.
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of-"""
Basics of Java Servlets and JSPs
Connecting to MySQL Database   from Netbeans IDE
Creating database and tables
"""If not, for relevant tutorials please visit our website."""
"""Now, let us go to Netbeans IDE."""
I have started the MySQL server.
I have created a database in it named  library.
I have created a table in it named Users.
I have already inserted some values into this table.
I will show them now.
"""For that, right click on Users and click on View Data."""
Click on the Output button at the bottom.
We can see that there are 15 users here.
"""We can see the FirstName, Surname, Age, Gender, email, Username and Password."""
"""Now, let us load the JDBC driver that is Java Database Connectivity Driver."""
"""For that, click on the Projects tab."""
Right-click on Libraries and  click on Add Library.
Then click on MySQL JDBC Driver.
And click on Add Library.
This will load the JDBC Driver.
Let us run the Projectas we had done earlier.
"""Now,  type the User Name as """"arya"""" and Password as """"arya123*""""."""
Then click on Sign In.
We can see the Success Greeting Page.
Click on here to logout.
"""Now, let us switch back to the IDE."""
We will go to GreetingServlet dot java.
Come to the doPost method.
"""First, we get the username and password from the request using getParameter() method."""
"""Next, we will see the code for JDBC connection."""
"""First, we have initialized the Connection object, PreparedStatement object and ResultSet object to null."""
Then we register the driver in our program.
Then we create a connection to the database.
"""Then, we execute the prepareStatement method on the Connection object."""
We give the query to get the user details from Users table.
We check if username and password are same as that which are entered in the form.
"""Here, the question mark denotes each field in the database."""
"""To supply values in place of question mark, we execute the setString() method."""
We do this using the PreparedStatement object.
Then we execute the executeQuery method on the Prepared statement object.
We store  the result in ResultSet object.
"""For successful login, we display the successGreeting page."""
"""For this, we use the RequestDispatcher interface."""
We use the getRequestDispatcher() method on the request to obtain the RequestDispatcher object.
We then invoke the forward() method on RequestDispatcher. object.
"""In this way, we forward to successGreeting dot jsp."""
Now switch back to the slides.
Let us learn something about RequestDispatcher interface.
This  interface provides the facility of dispatching  the request to another resource.
"""The resource can be html, servlet or jsp."""
"""Now, let us come back to the IDE."""
Let us come to successGreeting  dot'jsp.'
"""Here, we are displaying the success message You have successfully logged in."""
"""Now, come back to the browser."""
Type a username and password that we have not included in the database.
"""So, let me type abc as the username and abc123* as the password."""
Then click on Sign In.
We can see that we get the error message on the same page itself.
"""""""Please correct the following errors!!! Invalid username or password"""" ."""
"""Now, let us see the code for this."""
"""So, switch back to the IDE."""
Go to GreetingServlet dot java.
If the validation fails then we should display the error message.
"""First, we have  initialized a List of errorMsgs."""
We set the variable errorMsgs into the request scope using setAttribute method.
"""Here, errorMsgs is the attribute name."""
We have initialized a String variable id to null.
"""Then, we check if the user exists in the database."""
"""If yes, we store the value in the variable id."""
"""Else, we add the error """"Invalid username or password""""  to errorMsgs list."""
If the errorMsgs list is not empty then we display the error messages on index dot jsp.
"""So, we have to redirect to index  dot  jsp."""
We have already seen how to redirect to another page using RequestDispatcher.
Note that we have included this code inside the try catch block to handle exception scenarios.
"""Now, we will see how to fetch errorMsgs variable in index dot jsp."""
"""First, we obtain the value of the attribute """"errorMsgs""""."""
This is done using  getAttribute method on the request.
Note that we have included the Java code within the opening tag  which is less than sign percentage sign and the closing tag percentage sign and greater than sign.
This block of code is known as scriptlet.
It contains Java code which is executed every time JSP is invoked.
If the value of errorMsgs is not null then we  display this message.
"""""""Please correct the following errors""""."""
Then we iterate through the list of  errorMsgs.
We then display the error messages as a list.
This is how we display the error messages on  index dot jsp.
"""Now, let us see how to add a user into the database."""
"""Before adding a user into the database, we have to create a model for the User table."""
"""Now, let us see what a model is."""
A model :Represents the underlying logical structure of data in a software application.
A Java class with attributes and setters and getters for them.
"""In this way, we can consider model as a whole instead of the individual attributes."""
"""Now, switch back to Netbeans IDE."""
I have already created the model User dot java.
Note that we have created this Java class inside the package org dot spokentutorial dot model.
"""We have the following attributes- firstName, surname, age, gender, email, username and password."""
We have initialized them to empty values.
Then we have a parameterized constructor.
We also have the default constructor.
We define the getFirstName method.
We also define the setFirstName method.
"""Similarly, we define the set and get methods on each of the attributes."""
Come back to the browser.
"""Now, let us click on here link to register."""
Type all the fields in the Registration page.
Then click on Add User.
We get  Add User Success page.
"""We get  the message:  """"Your request to add harshita was successful""""."""
Here harshita was the username that we have given.
"""Now, let us see how this is done."""
"""So, switch back to the IDE."""
Go to  AddUserServlet dot  java.
The steps are similar to that we had followed in GreetingServlet dot java.
"""First, we get the form parameters using the getParameter method."""
We initialize variable user as instance of User model with individual attributes.
We set the variable user into the request scope using setAttribute method.
"""If there are no errors while filling  the form, we execute the query to  insert the values into the Users table."""
Then we forward to successUser page.
"""Now, let us come to successUser  dot  jsp."""
"""First, we have imported User dot java."""
This line of code is called directive in JSP.
A JSP directive starts with opening tag- 'less than sign percentage sign and at the rate sign' and ends with closing tag- 'percentage sign and greater than sign'.
This one is a page directive.
The page directive contains a list of all imported packages.
We get the value of the attribute user and store it as the User object.
"""Then, we have the success message here."""
"""Here, we have retrieved the Username."""
We have used the getUsername() method on the request object.
We have done this using scriptlet tags.
"""Now, let us come back to the browser."""
We will try to add a user already present in the database.
"""So, I will try to add harshita again."""
"""We can see that we get the error message  """"Please correct the following errors!!!!  Duplicate entry 'harshita' for key 'UserName'."""
"""Now, let us register for a user once again."""
"""Here, I have filled up the form now."""
I have created a mistake in the Age field.
I have typed ab instead of a valid number.
"""Now, click on Add User."""
"""We see, we get the error message- """"The age must be a positive integer""""."""
"""Now, let us see how this is done."""
Switch back to the IDE.
Open AddUserServlet dot java.
"""Here also, we have created a list for errorMsgs."""
Then we set the variable errorMsgs into the request scope using setAttribute method.
"""Then, we have declared ageUser of type integer and we have initialized it to -1 (minus one)."""
"""Inside the try catch block, we have used parseInt method."""
"""This will return an integer, given a string representation of number as input."""
"""So, here we validate that the age field contains a valid positive integer."""
If the validation fails then we add error message to errorMsgs list.
The age must be a positive integer.
"""Similarly, we have to validate all the other fields to have valid data."""
If the errorMsgs list is not empty then we will display the errorMsgs on addUser dot jsp itself.
We have already seen how to do this using the RequestDispatcher.
"""Now, let us come to addUser dot jsp."""
"""Here also, first we have imported User dot java."""
"""Inside the scriptlet tags, we have created an object of type User."""
Then we get the value of the attribute errorMsgs using getAttribute method.
We check if this value is equal to null.
If it is not equal to null then  we display the error message just as we had done for index  dot jsp.
"""If not, we will get the value of the attribute user from request using  'User' model."""
Then we have the form.
The form tag has action as AddUserServlet and method as POST.
"""The first field is First Name of input type as text , name as firstName  and value as user dot getFirstName."""
"""Here, we are initializing the value of firstName to empty string."""
"""Similarly, you have to do for other fields."""
We also have a  submit  button and value as   Add User.
This is how we validate the fields in addUser.jsp.
"""You can try out different errors on """"addUser"""" page."""
"""Now, let us see if the user harshita has been added to the database."""
"""So, come back to the Users table. We can see that harshita is added to the database."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
Database connectivity and
Field validation.

Hi everyone.Welcome to this tutorial on Handling Images in a Java GUI Application using Netbeans IDE.
We assume that you have the basic working knowledge of Netbeans.
"""We also assume that you know to place text fields, buttons, menus etc. on a JFrame form."""
"""If not, then please visit the Spoken Tutorial website for relevant tutorials on Netbeans."""
"""In this tutorial, we will learn in detail about handling images"""
"""and perform actions on them, in a sample GUI application."""
"""For this demonstration, I am using the  Linux Operating System Ubuntu version 11.04 and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1."""
The standard way to handle and access images in a Java Application is by using the 'getResource()' method.
"""We will learn how to use the IDE's GUI Builder to generate the code, to include images in your application"""
and create a simple Jframe with one Jlabel displaying an image.
"""In this tutorial, we will -"""
* Create the application form
* Add a package for the image
* Display the image on the Label
* Create mouse-events and pop-ups
* Build and run the application.
"""Now, let us switch to the IDE to create our sample application."""
"""From the File menu, choose New Project."""
"""Under Categories , select  Java; under Projects select Java Application and click Next."""
"""In the Project Name field, type: ImageDisplayApp."""
Clear the  Create Main Class check-box.
Make sure that the Set as Main Project check-box is selected.
Click Finish. The project is created in your IDE.
"""In this section, we will create the Jframe form and add a Jlabel to the form."""
Let us first create the Jframe form.
"""In the Projects window, expand the ImageDisplayApp node."""
Right-click on the Source Packages node and choose  New >> Jframe Form.
"""In the Class Name field, type: ImageDisplay."""
"""In the Package field, type: org.me.myimageapp"""
and click Finish.
"""Now, let us add the Jlabel."""
"""In the Palette, on the right hand side of the IDE, select the Label component and drag it to the Jframe."""
"""For now, your form should look something like this."""
"""When you use images or other resources in an application, typically you create a separate Java package for the resource."""
"""On your local file system, a package corresponds with a folder."""
"""In the Projects window, right-click the org.me.myimageapp node and choose New > Java Package."""
"""In the New Package Wizard, add '.resources' to 'org.me.myimageapp'."""
"""So, the new package is now called org.me.myimageapp.resources."""
Click Finish.
"""In the Projects window, you should see the image appear within the org.me.myimageapp.resources package, when you add the image."""
"""In this application, the image will be embedded within a Jlabel component."""
Let us now add the image to the label.
"""In the GUI designer, select the label that you have added to your form."""
"""In the Properties window, below the Palette, on the right hand side of the window, scroll down to the icon property."""
Click the ellipsis (...) or the three dots on the right side.
"""In the icon Property dialog-box, click Import to Project."""
"""In the file chooser, navigate to the folder that contains your image that you want to use."""
Click Next.
"""In the Select target folder page of the wizard, select the resources folder"""
and click Finish.
"""After you click Finish, the IDE copies the image to your project."""
"""Therefore, when you build and run the application, the image is included in the distributable JAR file."""
Click OK here.
And right-click on your project node and select  Clean and Build option.
"""You can now go to the Files menu and under the build folder,"""
"""under dist folder, you can see the jar file."""
It generates the code in the 'imagedisplay' class to access the image.
It also displays your image on the label in the Design view of your form.
"""At this point, you can do some simple things to improve the appearance of the form."""
"""In the Properties window, select the Text property"""
and delete jLabel1.
That value was generated by the GUI Builder as display text for the label.
"""However, you are using the label to display an image rather than text."""
"""So, this text is not needed."""
"""Now, let us drag the label to center it on the form."""
"""In the GUI Designer, click the  Source tab."""
Scroll down to the line that says  Generated Code.
"""And click the plus sign (+) to the left of the  Generated Code line, to display the code that the  GUI Designer has generated."""
"""Here, the keyline is this."""
"""Since you have used the  Property editor for  jLabel1s icon property, the IDE has generated the setIcon method."""
The parameter of that method contains a call to the  getResource() method on an anonymous inner class of ImageIcon.
"""Once your image has been added, in the  Design view  right-click on the image."""
Click on Events > Mouse > mouseClicked.
The view is switched to the Source mode.
Here you can add the code to customize your action on a mouse-click.
Let me add a few lines of code to generate a pop-up when the image is clicked in the GUI.
I have now entered a few lines of code to generate the pop-up.
"""First, I have created a new  Jframe for the pop-up"""
and I have set the defaultCloseOperation.
"""And finally, provided the text for the pop-up."""
"""After adding these lines of code, let us import the necessary packages by adding two statements at the beginning of the file."""
Include:  import javax.swing.*;
and  import java.awt.*;
This will import the necessary packages required for this program.
Let us now build and run the application.
We have generated the code for accessing and displaying the image.
Let us build and run the application to ensure that the image is accessed.
"""First, we need to set the project's  Main class."""
"""When you set the  Main class, the  IDE knows which class to run when you run the project."""
"""In addition, this ensures that the Main class element in the application's JAR file is generated when you build the application."""
"""Here, right-click on the ImageDisplayApp project's Node in the Projects window and choose Properties."""
"""In the Project Properties dialog-box, select the Run category on the left side."""
"""Click the Browse button, that is next to the Main Class field."""
Select  org.me.myimageapp.ImageDisplay  and click on  Select Main Class
Say OK here.
"""Now, right-click  on the  Project node  and select Clean & Build."""
You can view the Build  properties of the application in the  Files window.
The Build folder contains the compiled class.
The dist folder contains an executable JAR file that contains the compiled class and the image.
Now choose Run from the tool bar.
Our output window opens with the image.
I will click on this image now.
And you can see the pop-up at the top which shows the description of the image.
"""Now, time for the assignment!"""
"""Create another GUI with four images, similar to the demonstration shown in this tutorial."""
"""For each of the images, specify different events such as keyboard event, mouse-motion event, mouse-click event, mouse-wheel event."""
I have already created the assignment.
Let us run the assignment project.
Your assignment should look similar to this.
I have created keyboard-events and mouse-events for my assignment here.
"""So, to summarize-"""
"""we have created a Jframe form,"""
"""added a package for the image,"""
"""displayed the image on the label,"""
and also created mouse-events and pop-ups.
"""If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch it."""

We are now in the Admin’s dashboard.
Recall that Blocks serve a specific purpose or information and are found on all pages of Moodle.
Let us understand how we can work with Moodle Blocks now.
"""Depending on the theme used, blocks can be on the right side or on both sides."""
Blocks contain information we want people to see whenever they log in.
"""There are many types of blocks available in Moodle. And, they can be moved or arranged easily as per our preferences."""
We will now add a few blocks to our dashboard.
Click on the navigation menu on the left of the page.
Click on Customise this page button on the right hand side of the dashboard.
Notice that a new menu item Add a block is visible now. Click on Add a block.
A new pop-up window opens. We need to select the type of block that we want to add.
"""For example, click on Messages. You can see that the Messages block now appears in the dashboard."""
Currently there are no messages.
"""By default, all new blocks get added to the right-most column."""
Let us add one more block. Click on Add a block menu on the left.
Select HTML from the list of menu types. HTML block is a block where one can write custom HTML.
"""Using this, we can embed widgets such as Library widgets, News feeds, Twitter, Facebook etc."""
Notice now that a NEW HTML BLOCK has been added below the Messages block.
Click on the gear icon in the HTML block. Then click on Configure (NEW HTML BLOCK) block.
"""Configure HTML block has 3 sections: Block settings ,  Where this block appears and On this page."""
"""By default, the first section is expanded."""
Click on Expand all to expand all the sections.
"""In the Block title, let’s type: “Things to do”."""
Let us add some tasks for this admin user in the Content area.
"""Type the following: Create a new course,  Create new users,  Add users to the course."""
The editor is an HTML editor and can be used like any other word processor or editor.
Scroll down to see the options under Where this block appears.
"""Under Default region, select Content. In Default weight, select -10 (minus ten)."""
"""The lower the weight of a block, the higher it will appear in that region. -10 (minus ten) is the lowest."""
"""By selecting -10, I am ensuring that it is at the top of the content region."""
This block  will appear on the Admin’s dashboard.
Now comes the “On this page” section. This is where you can define the configuration for the page where this block was added.
"""In our case, this is the dashboard. This configuration will override the default configuration defined in the above section"""
"""that is, the Where this block appears section. Let us select Content in Region and -10 (minus ten) in Weight in this section."""
"""Please note that depending on the type of the block, configuration settings will vary."""
Click Save Changes to save the changes and go back to the dashboard.
"""See that the new HTML block with the title Things to do is now visible. And, it is the topmost block in the content region."""
We can also change the position of a block by dragging it using the Move icon.
Let us move Things to do block below the Course Overview block by dragging and dropping it.
Let us see how this changes the configuration we set a few minutes back.
Click on the gear icon and then on Configure Things to do block. Then click on Expand All.
"""Scroll down to see “On this page” section. The weight has changed to -2 (minus two). The default weight, however, remains the same."""
Click Cancel to go back to the dashboard.
We do not need this Learning Plans block. So let us delete it. Click on the gear icon and then on Delete Learning plans block.
Confirm pop-up window appears and prompts us to make sure about this deletion. Click on Yes button here.
Notice that the Learning Plans block is no longer available. We can always add this block later if required.
Let us now customize the front page of our Moodle installation.
Click on Site Administration link on the left menu.
Scroll down to locate Front Page settings in the Front page section. Click on it.
Let us change the Full Site Name to Digital India Learning Management System.
This is the text that appears at the top of every page above the breadcrumbs.
Short name is the text that appears in the title of the page.
Notice that the title of this page is Digital India LMS followed by the name of the page we are in.
Short name is also used as a logo text if we do not provide any logo image. We will leave it as it is.
Scroll down to see drop-downs for Front page items. These are the list of items that can be shown on the front page.
"""All visitors, whether they are logged in or not, can see these items."""
The order is determined by a combination box. We will leave this as it is.
"""So, all users will be able to see the list of courses (if available) and nothing else."""
Next is the Front page items when logged in. This is the list of items that can be shown to the users who are logged in.
Let us select Enrolled courses in the first drop-down.
We will leave the rest of the options with their default values.
Scroll down and click on Save Changes.
Let us now summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to add an HTML block called “Things to do” and specified where it should appear on the page."""

Warm greetings everyone. Welcome to this tutorial on Create surfaces.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:  view properties of the molecule,"""
"""label the atoms with partial charge,"""
"""create Van der waals surface,"""
color the surface according to the electrostatic potential energies.
"""Here, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version. 14.04, Avogadro version 1.1.1."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with 'Avogadro' interface."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website."""
Here I have opened the Avogadro window.
Insert a molecule of butane from Insert Fragment Library.
"""Click on Build menu, then click on Insert ->fragment."""
Double-click on alkanes folder to open. Select butane.cml.
Click on Insert button.
Close the dialog box.
A model of n-butane is displayed on the panel.
Clear the selection using Select none option from the Select menu.
Let us display molecular properties of the molecule.
"""Click on View menu, select Properties option."""
"""From the sub-menu, click on Molecule Properties."""
"""Molecule Properties window opens with information such as: IUPAC Molecule Name, Molecular weight, Chemical Formula, Dipole moment etc."""
Click on OK to close the window.
"""Similarly to view the Atom Properties, click on Atom properties option from the properties menu."""
"""A table opens with values of properties such as: Element, Type, Valence, Formal charge etc for each atom in the molecule."""
"""Explore other properties like Angle, Torsion and Conformer from the list."""
Let us now learn to label the atoms in the molecule with partial charge.
"""Click on Display settings from the Display Types list, check the box against Label."""
Click on the Spanner symbol on the right side of Label check box.
Label Settings window opens.
Click on Partial charge option from atom labels text drop down. Now all the atoms in the molecule are labeled with partial charge.
The partial charge distribution helps to predict the reactivity of the carbon atoms.
Inductive effect can be explained by labeling the atoms with partial charge.
Replace a hydrogen with chlorine. Notice the change in the value of partial charge along the carbon chain.
"""Because of the inductive effect, carbons close to chlorine become more positive."""
We have also an option to label the bonds. Click on the bond labels text box.
The drop-down menu has options to label the bonds.
Click on bond length. The bond lengths for all the bonds are displayed on the panel.
"""To change the color of the labels, click on the box filled with color."""
Select the color from the Select atoms label color window. Click on OK button.
"""We can shift the labels in X, Y and Z direction."""
Click on the increment or decrement buttons in the label shift menu. Close the dialog box.
"""Another very useful feature of Avogadro is, the ability to create surfaces."""
The option for creating surfaces is available in the Extensions menu.
"""Click on Extensions menu, then click on Create Surfaces option."""
A Create Surface dialog box opens on the screen.
Surface Type drop-down has two options: Van der waals and electro-static potential.
Electrostatic potential surfaces  are not yet supported in Avogadro.
"""Choose Van der waals option. In the Color By drop down, select Nothing."""
Set Resolution to Medium.
Iso value to zero. Click on Calculate button.
The Van der waals surface is displayed on the panel.
Van der waals surface is a representation of surface through which a molecule interacts with other molecules.
"""To change the surface settings, click on the spanner symbol corresponding to Surfaces."""
A Surface Settings dialog box opens. Drag the slider to adjust the opacity.
"""In the Render drop-down, there are different display options to choose such as: Fill, lines and points."""
The default option is fill.
"""To change the color of the surface, click on the box filled with color next to Positive option."""
Select the color from the basic color chart by clicking on the color. Click on OK button.
"""Next, from the Create surface window, choose Electrostatic potential from the Color by drop-down."""
Set the resolution to medium.  Set the Iso value to 0.02.
Setting low Iso value gives a finer surface.
Click on Calculate button.
"""On the panel, we see the surface of 1-chloro butane,  colored according to the electro-static potential values of atoms."""
Electrostatic potential surface illustrates charge distributions of the molecule.
They are also used in predicting the behavior of molecules.
"""By default, areas of high electronegativity are colored in red and least in blue."""
Here are a few more examples of molecules with electro-static potential surfaces.
Aniline and cyclohexylamine.
The electron density on the Nitrogen of cyclohexylamine is more localized than it is in aniline.
Hence cyclohexylamine is a stronger base.
"""Let's summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to: view properties of the molecule,"""
"""label the atoms with partial charge,"""
"""create Van der waals surface,"""
color the surface according to the electrostatic potential energies.
As an assignment: compare the reactivity of acetaldehyde and formamide using electro-static potential surface.
Label the atoms with partial charge.
Your completed assignment should look as follows.
Negative charge indicated in red is more localized on the oxygen atom of acetaldehyde.
The Negative charge is more delocalized in formamide.
"""Hence, Acetaldehyde is more reactive than Formamide."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Nested-If and Ternary Operator in java.
By the end of this tutorial you should be able to: Explain Nested-If Statements and Ternary operators and  Use them in a Java program.
"""For this tutorial we are using: Ubuntu v 11.10, JDK 1.6, and EclipseIDE 3.7.0"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should know"""
about the usage of relational and logical operators
and if...else control flow statements.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown."""
Nested if statements: An If statement within another if statement  is called a nested-if statement.
Now let us look at the syntax for writing the Nested-If statement.
"""In this case, if condition1 is true, then the program checks for condition2."""
Condition 2 is given using another if statement.
If condition2 is true then the program executes Statement or block 1.
"""Else, it executes Statement or block 2."""
If condition1 is false then the program will not check condition2.
"""Now, let us try an example to understand that better."""
We have the eclipse IDE and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
We have created a class NesedIfDemo and added the main method to it.
We shall check if the given number is an even number or an odd number.
we will also handle negative numbers using a nested-if.
"""So, inside the main method type:"""
int n = minus 5;
We have created a variable 'n'  to store the negative number.
"""Now, we shall write the if conditions."""
"""Next line, type: if (n  < 0)"""
open curly bracket. Press Enter.
System.out.println within brackets and double quotes Negative number;
We first see if the number is a negative number.
"""If yes, then we will not check for even and odd."""
"""If the number is not a negative, we check for 'even' and 'odd'."""
"""Next line, type:else open curly bracket. Press Enter."""
"""Now, if the execution has come to the else part,"""
it means that the number is non-negative.
"""So, we check for odd or even inside this else part."""
Type:if within brackets n modulus 2  double equal to 0 open curly bracket press Enter.
System.out.println  within brackets and double quotes Even number;
"""Then type the else part. else open curly braket, press Enter."""
Type: System.out.println within brackets and double quotes Odd number semicolon.
"""So, we make sure that negative numbers are not considered for 'odd' or 'even' check."""
"""Now, let us see the code in action."""
"""Save and run the file. As we can see, we get the output  as negative number."""
Now let us try a positive number.
Change n = -5 to n = 5.
Now Save and Run the file.
"""As we can see, the output is Odd number as expected. Let us try an even number."""
Change n = 5 to n = 10.
Now Save and run the file.
"""As we can see, the output is Even number as expected."""
"""This process of including an if statement inside another, is called nested-if."""
There is no limit to the amount of nesting.
But it is a good practice to not go beyond 3 levels of nesting.
Now we shall look at the ternary operator.
"""First, let me clean up the main method."""
We shall write a program that divides a number by 2.
It is a very trivial program but the issue comes in dividing odd numbers.
"""When 7 is divided by 2, we get 3."""
But what if we want the result to be rounded off.
"""Which means, when 7 is divided by 2, we get  4 and not 3."""
"""In simple terms, we need the next number."""
"""Let us see how to write such a program."
"See, inside the main method type:  int n, nHalf semicolon."""
We will store the number in n and the half number in nHalf
"""Next line, type: n = 5 semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: if within bracket n modulus 2 == 0 open curly brackets. Press Enter."""
Type: nHalf = n / 2 semicolon.
"""In the else part, type: within curly brackets nHalf equal to within brackets n+1 the whole divided by 2 semicolon."""
We check if the number is even or odd and do the division accordingly.
Now  Let us add a print statement to see the program in action.
"""So, type System.out.println within brackets nHalf semicolon."""
Now  Save and Run the file.
"""As we can see, our objective is met. We get the output as 3 and not 2."""
"""But if we notice, all we are doing is setting the value of a variable depending on a condition."""
There is more syntax than logic in our program.
This is when ternary operator makes code simpler.
Ternary Operator is a conditional operator providing results similar to nested-if.
It Provides a short syntax and is denoted by a question mark.
It takes three operands at a time.
Let us learn about the syntax of Ternary Operator.
The Expression is the condition that has to be checked.
Operand 1 is the value of the variable. Result if the condition is true.
Operand 2 is the value if the condition is false.
Now Let us use it in our program.
"""First, let us remove the if-else statement."""
Type: nHalf equal to  n modulus 2 double equal to 0 question mark n / 2 colon within brackets n + 1 the whole divided by 2 semicolon.
This statement reads:
"""If 'n' is even, 'nHalf' is 'n by 2'. Otherwise it is 'n plus 1 by 2'."""
Let us now see it in action.
Save and Run the file. Press Ctrl S and Ctrl F11 keys.
"""As we can see, the output is as expected."""
"""This way, ternary operator reduces clutter in the code and improves readability."""
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
About Nested-If Statements and Ternary Operator and
Usage of Nested-If Statements and Ternary Operator in a Java program.
Write java program for the following.
Check whether a number is even and also a multiple of 11 using nested-if.
Identify the largest number among the two given numbers using Ternary operator.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Arithmetic Operators in C And C++.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
Arithmetic operators like '+' Addition: e.g. a+b.
'-' Subtraction: e.g. a-b.
'/' Division: e.g. a/b.
'*'  Multiplication: e.g. a*b.
'%' Modulus: e.g. a%b.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 11.10 as the operating system gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 in Ubuntu."
I will now demonstrate the use of these arithmetic operations with the help of a C program.
I have already written the program.
"""So, I will open the editor and explain the code."""
Here is the C program for arithmetic operators.
"""In the first two statements, the variables are declared and defined."""
"""In the next two statements, a is assigned the value of 5. b is assigned the value of 2."
Now let's see how the addition operator works.
c holds the sum of a and b.
This printf statement displays the sum of a and b on the screen.
Here % dot 2f provides the precision of two digits after the decimal point.
"""In the next statement, c holds the product of a and b."""
This printf statement displays the product of a and b on the screen.
Let's see how these two operators work.
We will comment out the following lines.
Type  /* (slash asterisk) */
Click on Save.
Save the file with extension .c (dot c).
I have saved my file as arithmetic.c.
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""To compile the code, type the following on the terminal."""
gcc space arithmetic dot c space minus o space arith
"""To execute the code, type ./arith (dot slash arith)."""
press Enter.
The output is displayed on the screen.
"""It shows,Sum of 5 and 2 is 7.00 and"""
Product of 5 and 2 is 10.00.
Now you should try the subtraction operator on your own.
Try replacing the addition operator with subtraction operator.
You should get the result as 3.
Coming back to the program and the last set of statements.
"""Now, I will explain the code for division."""
Remove the multiline comments  here and here.
"""In these statements, c holds the value of integer division of a by b."""
Please note that in integer division the fractional part is truncated.
The printf statement displays the division output on the screen.
In this statement we are performing real division.
Here one of the operands has to be cast as float.
We have type-cast variable a.
Now a will behave as a float variable for a single operation.
The printf statement displays the output of real division on the screen.
Type return 0; and close the ending curly bracket.
Click on Save.
Coming back to the terminal to compile and execute the code.
"""To compile, typegcc space arithmetic dot c minus o space arith. Press Enter."""
"""To execute the code, type ./arith. Press Enter."""
The output is displayed on the screen.
We have the previous outputs of addition and multiplication operators.
We have the integer Division of 5 by 2 is 2.
We can see  that  in integer division the fractional part is truncated.
Then we have  the real division of 5 by 2 is 2.5.
"""In real division, the result is as expected."""
We  used type-casting to obtain these results.
"""Now suppose, I want to write the same program in C++."""
Let's see  if I can use the same code in C++ too? Let's find out.
Let me go back to the editor.
Here is a C++ code.
Notice that the header is different from the C file header.
namespace is also used here.
"""Also, notice that the output statement in C++ is cout."""
"""So, apart from these differences, the two codes are very similar."""
Click on Save.Make sure the file is saved with the extension .cpp.
I have saved my file as arithmetic.cpp.
Let's execute the code and see what results we get.
Open the terminal and type  g++ space arithmetic dot cpp space  minus o arith . Press Enter.
"""To  execute the  code, type  ./ arith. Press Enter."""
Here the output is displayed.
"""So, we see that  the results are similar to the C program."""
The only difference is in the precisions of outputs.
Let us now summarize the tutorial.
In this tutorial we learnt how to use the arithmetic operators.
As an assignment: Write a program to demonstrate the use of modulus operator.
Please note that Modulus operator finds the remainder of division.  e.g. c = a % b;
You should obtain the result as 1.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Numerical Data types in Java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
The various Numerical Data types  available in Java and
How to use them to store numerical data.
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse 3.7."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know how to write and run a simple java program in Eclipse."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown."""
The data type used to store integers is called int.
The data type used to store decimal numbers is called float.
Let us define and use integers first.
"""Here, we have the 'Eclipse IDE' and the skeleton required for the rest of the code."""
We have created a class NumericalData  and  added the main method to it.
"""Now, let us see how to store a number."""
int distance equal to 28;
This statement stores the integer value in the name distance.
The name distance is called  an integer variable.
Now we shall use the variable distance to print the value stored in it.
System dot out dot println in parentheses distance;
This statement prints the value of the variable distance.
Save the file and Run it.
We can see that the value 28 has been stored in distance and it has been printed.
Now let us change the value stored in the variable.
change 28 to 24.
Save and Run.
We  see that the output  has changed accordingly.
int can also store negative values.
Change 24 to minus 25 (-25).
"""As we can see, even negative values can be stored in variables of the type int."""
The data type int is enough for most of our programming needs.
But it can only store values up to a limit.
Let us try to store a large value and see what happens.
"""As we can see, there is a red line below the number which indicates an error."""
The error message says: the number is out of range for a variable of the type int.
int takes 32 bits of memory and can store values only from -2 power 31 to 2 power 31.
"""To store large numbers, Java provides the long data type."""
Let us use it to store a large value.
Change int to long and
add a capital L at the end of the number.
"""Save it with Ctrl, S."""
We see that now there is no error.
"""Let us run it with Ctrl, F11. The value has been printed."""
We can see that large numbers can be stored in a long variable.
"""Now, let us store a decimal number in a int variable."""
Change long to int and change the number to 23.5;
"""As we can see, there is an error. That is because int can only store integers."""
"""To store decimal numbers, we have to use float."""
change the data type to float.
And add an f at the end of the value;
Save it.
We see that now their is no error.
Run it with Control F11.
"""As we can see, the decimal value has been stored and the value has been printed."""
"""Now, let us change the value of  the variable distance."""
Add a  lot of numbers after the decimal point as shown.
Save it  and Run it.
we  see that  the  output is little different from what has been stored.
This happens because there is a limit to the precision of a floating point number.
It is rounded off to the closest possible number if it cannot be stored accurately.
Now let us see the naming rules for variables.
Add a number 2 before the name.
we see that there is a syntax error.
This is because a variable name must only start with an alphabet or an underscore.
But generally 'underscore' is not used to start a variable name.
"""Now, let us add the number at the end of the variable name."""
We see that there is no error.
A variable name can have digits but not at the beginning.
"""Now add an  'underscore' in the middle of the name,"""
we see that there is no error
which means an 'underscore' is permitted  in a variable name.
But any other punctuation in a variable name might give a syntax error or other errors.
This is how you store numerical data in Java.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about the various numerical data types"""
and how to store numerical data.
And we have also learnt the rules for naming a variable.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial,"""
read about other numerical data types and
see how they are different from int and float.

Welcome to Meet The GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""Today, we will talk about the Fuzzy Select Tool."""
It is closely related to the Select by Colour tool.
But the Fuzzy Select Tool selects only one contiguous region and the colour select tool selects all regions with similar colours.
"""There are some similar options like Replace, Add, Subtract and Intersect with the current selection and now I select Replace."""
"""Here you can see the same option, Antialiasing."""
"""If we select Antialiasing, border of the selection is not sharp and you get smooth corners."""
And if it is not selected then you have a really sharp border between selected and unselected.
The further options are Feather edges and Select transparent areas.
Select transparent areas is useful while using mask sensor on perhaps.
Sample merged is the same as with the other and it selects all the visible layers.
If it is not selected then it works on current layer.
If you want to select something from the total output of image then select this option.
Here is Threshold which defines how much difference between the colours is allowed to be in the selection or when something is out of selection.
It helps in selecting the pixels that have one definite colour.
"""The next important selection is, which mode do you want to have in the selection."""
"""The Composite mode is the gray value of added Red, Green and Blue channels."""
"""You can select the Red, the Green, the Blue channel or the Hue, Saturation or the Value channel as the base for your selection."""
Now let's try Fuzzy Select Tool.
"""I just click into the image and the Threshold is zero, so let's see what happens."""
I make a selection which is one pixel in size.
Now I increase the amount of Threshold to say 30 and click into the image and click on Toggle Quick Mask here.
Now you can see the area which is selected.
"""I de-select the Quick Mask toggle, press tab to get the toolbox and press Shift+Ctrl+A to unselect everything."""
"""I can do this in a different way and for that, I decrease the Threshold to zero and click into the image and now, I am drawing the mouse down and right."""
"""When I increase the threshold, you can see that I am going into this blue area but I am still on the wall."""
"""I think, this tool is more useful for graphic designers and not for photographers."""
You can change the Threshold by just pulling the mouse.
This works the same in colour selection tool.
I change Select by from Composite to Hue and click at the same point and draw to the bottom.
"""You can see that I have a way better selection of  blue, green part of the wall, than I had before."""
"""So, choosing the right method of colour definition gives good result with this tool."""
I click into the quick mask and here you see it’s nearly perfect; only some parts to repair and I would do that with painting in the quick mask and not with these selection tools.
If you are confused about selecting the mode then you can see your image in different channels in the Channels mode.
Select the Blue channel and you see that everything has nearly the same blue value.
"""In the Green channel, there are some differences."""
"""In the Red channel, it’s nearly the same here."""
"""So, I would select the Green channel for selecting or in this case Hue channel."""
Selecting colour is the next tool here and it has the same function and same options here.
It has only one difference.
"""If you click here, you will select all fields with this colour and not one contiguous area."""
The colour selection tool selects all the areas with the similar colour.
The name of the next tool is  Intelligent scissors or Scissors selection tool .
This algorithm looks for edges and tries to follow them with the selection.
"""And I want to select here, these letter boxes."""
"""So, I activate the selection tool and I pull a point here and I get a plus sign near the cursor and I simply select the points."""
"""The algorithm is supposed to follow the borders and you can see here, it didn’t take the other way, it took the inside way."""
I zoom into the image and now I can draw this point up to here and there was a mistake with selecting this point.
"""So, I pull these points up and you can see the algorithm follows the border, if you give enough information where to follow."""
It looks pretty good but I usually don’t use this because there are better ways to do this.
"""I think, I would use the colour selection tool because it always takes the wrong way round."""
"""So, I finished with the selection."""
I just click on the first point here and the cursor changes to plus.
"""Now, put the next point and I have these two rings making a loop out of it."""
I can still move the point around here and make the selection better.
"""So, when I now click into the selection second time, the selection is selected."""
"""And, to look at the quality, I activate the Quick Mask and zoom into it."""
"""Now, I look around in the selection."""
"""Here is my fault, I should have clicked here."""
"""So, this is the fairly intelligent scissors."""
The next and the last tool I want to cover today is the Foreground Selection Tool.
It was quite sensation when the algorithm came out sometime ago and it was not so sensational in using in the GIMP.
"""But, let's give it a try."""
Here are the same modes and antialiasing isn’t activatable.
"""And here, I want to select one single area and I want to select the statue."""
"""So, first I zoom into the image to get a  better control."""
"""Now, I select the selection tool and I can select contiguous region or different region but I select the Contiguous region."""
"""First I make a rough selection here, with the automatic laser tool. And now you can see that the area which is not selected, is in blue colour."""
I have selected a brush here and I can control the diameter of the brush with this slider and I paint through this stuff I want to have selected.
I have to see that I don’t select stuff which I don’t want to have in the image.
"""When I release the mouse button, the algorithm starts to work and some areas here have to be selected."""
"""Every time the selection gets updated and area that is similar to the stuff I just painted over, gets selected."""
"""Now, I click on Mark Background and start painting the background that I don’t want to have in the image."""
This tool works better when there is more difference between the selected part and the stuff which is not selected and here the difference is not big enough.
Just press Enter to accept the selection.
"""I think, you have got an idea of how this tool works."""
The Paths tool belongs also to this part but I will cover that sometimes else.
"""In the Select menu, there are some other stuff you can do with selections and I will cover that also sometime else."""
"""So, this was it for this tutorial."""
Let me hear some comments and I promise you for the next show with really new things which are viewer generated content.
You will find a link to this file in the show notes at meetthegimp.org and if you want to leave a comment then please do that.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Warli art for Textile design using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial we will learn to create a Warli pattern design for borders, Repeat patterns using cloning"""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.91"""
Let us open Inkscape. First let us design the warli pattern.
Go to File.  Click on Document Properties.  Change the Orientation to Landscape.  Close the dialog box
Select the Rectangle tool. Draw a rectangle covering the whole canvas and color it blue.
"""Click on the Ellipse tool.  Draw a circle outside the canvas. Then, click on the Selector tool."""
"""On the Tool controls bar, change the width and height to 15."""
Change its color to orange. Move it to the bottom of the canvas as shown.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the circle.
On the Tool controls bar change the width and height to 7.
Move the duplicated circle to the bottom left of the original circle.
This is the head of the warli figure.
"""Next, Go to Object menu.  Click on Symbols options. Click on Symbol set drop-down menu. Select Flow Chart Shapes."""
A list of geometrical shapes appears. Click on the triangle shape and drag it to the canvas. Change the color to orange. And remove the Stroke.
"""On the Tool controls bar, change the width and height to 20."""
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the triangle. Press V to flip it.
"""Arrange the triangles below the head, as shown."""
This is the body of the warli figure.
Select the Rectangle tool.  And draw a line in between the head and the body.
Now the neck of the figure is drawn.
"""Next let us draw the hands and legs.  For this, we will select the Bezier tool."""
Draw hands and legs as demonstrated.
"""Select both the hands and legs. Using the Picker tool on the Fill and Stroke, pick the orange color from the body of the warli art."""
Change the Stroke width to 2.
Now select all the elements and press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
Now the warli figure is ready. Let us now create a round pattern with this warli figure.
"""Let me make a copy of this figure and keep it to one side, before proceeding further."""
"""Now select the original warli art. Now, click once more on the figure, to make the anchor point visible."""
Click on the anchor point and move it down as demonstrated.
Now go to Edit.  Click on Clone and then on Create Tiled Clones.
"""In the dialog box, under Symmetry tab, the option in the drop-down menu should be Simple translation."""
"""Then go to Shift tab.  Under Per column option, change the X value to -100."""
Next go to Rotation tab.  Change the Per row and Per column parameters of the angle to 30.
"""At the bottom, let the number of rows be 1. Change the number of columns to 12."""
Then click on Create button.
Observe the round pattern that is created on the canvas.
Let us now try some other options.
Under Rotation tab Change the Per row and Per column parameters of the angle to 10.Click on Create.
Observe the created pattern on the canvas. To make it a complete round pattern change the number of Rows to 40.
Click on Create. Observe the changes on the canvas.
"""In such a way, you can change the Rotation parameters to get the patterns in different angles."""
Select the round pattern and press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
We now have a lovely warli art on our canvas.
"""Let's move it to one side, like this."""
"""Now, let's try some other options."""
"""Next, using the Create Spirals tool, draw a fairly large spiral on the canvas, as shown."""
"""Click on the Selector tool.  Select the single warli figure and place it at the centre of the spiral, like this."""
Now click on Raise to top option on the Tool Controls bar.
"""Then, select the spiral too."""
Click on Extensions menu and choose Generate from path option.
"""In the sub-menu that appears, select Scatter."""
"""A dialog box opens on the screen. Here, check the Follow path orientation checkbox."""
"""In Space between copies, we will say 5."""
Ensure that - Original pattern will be is set to Moved and Duplicate the pattern before deformation is also checked.
Click on Apply button and close the dialog box.
"""Let's move the spiral warli pattern aside a little to expose the spiral path.  Now, select the spiral path and delete it."""
This is how one can draw a beautiful spiral warli pattern in Inkscape.
"""Likewise, we can create many other lovely warli patterns."""
"""Next, let us learn how to create a border."""
Go to Object menu and click on Symbols.  Click on the triangle shape and drag it to the canvas.
"""On the Tool controls bar, change the width and height to 30."""
Now move the triangle to the top left of the canvas.
I want to create a row pattern using the triangle.
Go to Edit. Click on Clone and then on Create Tiled Clones. All the previous settings are visible here..
"""In the Rotation tab, change the Angle parameter of Per Row and Per Column to 0."""
"""In the Shift tab, under Per column option, change the X value to 0."""
"""Lastly, change the Column to 35, at the bottom, as shown here. Then click on Create button."""
Observe the row pattern that is created on the canvas.
Select all the triangles and press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the triangle pattern. Press V to flip it.
Now move the pattern to the bottom of the canvas.
Our warli pattern is now ready. We can use this pattern as border in various textile design assignments.
This is how it looks on a kurti.
"""We can use this as a pillow cover design, also."""
"""And this warli art looks great on a cloth bag, too."""
"""So, in a similar way, you can create various textile patterns using the warli art form."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we have learnt to create Warli pattern for textiles, patterns using cloning"""
Here is an assignment for you. Create a peacock pattern design

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on  files in C .
In this tutorial we will learn:
How to open a file.
How to read data from a file.
How to write data into a file.
Few examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10,  gcc Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with the introduction to files.
File is a collection of data.
"""It can be a database, a program, a letter or anything."""
We can create a file and access it using C.
Now let us see an example on file handling in C.
I have a written program.
Let's take a look Note that our file name is file.c
In this program we will create a file and write data into it.
Let me explain the code now.
This is our header file.
To define a file variable we use the type FILE.
The FILE variable is defined under the header stdio.h.
*fp is a pointer to the FILE variable.
"""It will store all the information about the file , like its name, status and current information."""
Let us go back to our slides.
Now we will see the syntax to open a file.
"""Here, the fopen() function opens a stream."""
Then it links the file with the stream.
file name is the name of the file that we want to open or create.
We can give the path along with the file name.
And We can also give the extension.
Here we can give the mode of the file.
Let us see the types of modes :
"""""""w"""" - creates file for read and write."""
"""""""r"""" – opens  file for reading."""
"""""""a"""" – writing at the end of the file."""
Now come back to our program.
"""Here, we create a Sample.txt file in write mode."""
We can see that the path is given.
Our file will be created on the desktop.
Then we will write the statements into the file.
"""""""Welcome to the spoken-tutorial""""  and"""
"""""""This is a test example""""."""
fprintf() writes output to the given output stream.
fclose() closes the file associated with the stream.
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space file dot c space hyphen o space file. Press Enter."
"To execute, type dot slash file (./file). Press Enter."
We see the file is executed.
Now we will check it out.
Let us open the Home folder.
Click on the Home folder option.
Now click on the Desktop option.
Here is our sample.txt file.
This shows that our file is successfully created.
Now let us open.
Double click on the file.
We can see the messages here.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial.
This is a test example.
This is how we create a file and write data into it.
Now we will see how to read data from a file.
I have already made the program.
I will open it.
"""In this program, we will read data from our sample.txt file and print the data on the console."""
This is our main() function.
"""Here, a file variable and a pointer to the file variable is defined."""
Then we have declared a character variable c.
"""Here, we open the file Sample.txt in read mode."""
The output is stored in fp.
Then we check the condition-
"""""""If fp is equal to NULL """"."""
If the condition is true then we print the message:
"""""""File doesn't exist."""""""
"""Else, it will check for another condition- While c is not equal to EOF."
"""Here, EOF is the end of file."""
It denotes the end of input.
It is a condition where no more data can be read from a data source.
"""If the condition is true then it will display the characters from Sample.txt file, on the console."""
"""Here, getc returns a character from a specified file or stream."""
"""Now, it will return a character from our Sample.txt file."""
putchar is used to display a character on the console.
Then it will store the characters in variable c.
Here we close the file.
Come back to the terminal.
"""To compile, type gcc space readfile dot c space hyphen o space read"" Now press Enter ."
"""To execute, type ./read (dot slash read)."""
The output is displayed as: Welcome to the Spoken-Tutorial.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Come back to our slides.
Let us summarize .In this tutorial we learnt:
"""File handling,"""
To write data into a file.
"""eg. fp = fopen(“Sample.txt”, “w”);"""
"""To read data from a file. eg. fp = fopen(“Sample.txt”, “r”);"""
As an assignment- Write a program to create a file TEST. Write your name and address in the file TEST. Then display it on the console using C Program.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on constructor overloading in java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn"""
what is constructor overloading
and  to overload constructor.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 OS Java Development kit 1.6 Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create constructors in java using eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
What is constructor overloading?
Define multiple constructors for a class.
They must  differ in number or types of parameters.
Let us now see how to overload constructor.
"""In eclipse, I have a class Student with two variables and a method."""
Let us first create a parameterized constructor.
"""So, type: Student within  parentheses int number comma String the_name."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: roll_number is equal to number."""
And  name is equal to the_name
"""So, we have a constructor with two parameters."""
Let us call this constructor.
"""So, in main method type: new Student parentheses semicolon."""
"""We see an error, it states that constructor Student is undefined."""
This is simply because we have defined a constructor with two parameters.
And we are calling a constructor without parameters.
"""So, we need to pass arguments."""
"""So, within parentheses type: 22 comma in double quotes Ram."""
We see that the error is resolved.
Let us call the method.
"""So, before new , type: Student s is equal to new student."""
"""Now, using the object s we will call the method   studentDetail()."""
Save  the program and Run.
We see the output: 22 and Ram.
Now let us define a constructor with no parameter.
"""So, type: Student parentheses."""
Within curly brackets roll_number is equal to 0.
And  name is equal to in double quotes hyphen that is no name.
"""So, now we can call the constructor with no parameters."""
"""So, type: Student s1 is equal to new Student parentheses semicolon."""
"""This time we see no error, since we have defined a constructor without parameter."""
Then  s1 dot studentDetail();.
Save and Run the program.
"""So, in  the output  we see zero and dash when the default constructor is called."""
This is constructor overloading.
We have two constructors with different parameters.
Both the constructors obviously have same name.
"""So, depending on the type and number of parameters, the constructor is called."""
Let us see the advantage of constructor overloading.
"""Suppose, now we call a constructor with two parameters."""
"""So, type: Student s3= new Student();"""
"""Now within parentheses,  suppose I gave the name argument first and then the roll_number."""
"""Let's see what happens.So, in double quotes Raju comma 45."""
"""We see an error which states that """"The constructor Student with the parameter  String comma int is undefined."""""""
"""So, let us first define the constructor."""
"""So, type: Student within parentheses String the_name comma int r_no."""
"""So, over here first parameter is string and the second parameter is int."""
"""Then, within curly bracket, roll_number is equal to r_no;"""
and name is equal to the_name;
Save the program.
Now we   see that the error is resolved.
Let us call the method.
"""So, s3 dot studentDetail();"""
Save the program and Run.
"""So, we see the output 45 and Raju."""
"""So, here we see that when we call the constructor"""
we do not have to worry about the parameters that we are passing.
This is simply because we have defined multiple constructors with different parameters.
"""So, the proper constructor is overloaded."""
We can therefore now define  a constructor which takes only one parameter.
That is roll number.
"""So, type: Student within parentheses int num,"""
within curly brackets roll_number is equal to num.
"""And name is equal to """"no name""""."""
"""Now,  let us call this  constructor."""
"""So, type: Student s4 is equal to new Student;.  This time we will pass a single argument. So, let us pass 61."""
Then s4 dot  studentDetail();
"""So, in the output we see  the roll number as 61 and name as no name."""
"""As we can see, the proper overloaded constructor is called when new is executed."""
"""Based upon the parameters specified, the proper constructor is overloaded."""
This is how constructor overloading is done.
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learnt:"""

This brings us to the end of the tutorial.
Welcome to the tutorial on Programming Features of Eclipse.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about"""
the 'user friendly' programming features of Eclipse.
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.0, JDK 1.6, and Eclipse 3.7.0."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have"""
Eclipse installed  on your system and
you must know  how to write a simple java program in Eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorial, please visit our website as shown."""
Eclipse IDE supports many user friendly features such as:
Auto completion  Syntax highlighting
Error dialog box and Shortcut keys.
We will look into each of these features in detail.
I have  created a class named 'Features' and added the main method.
we will first look at Auto completion feature in Eclipse.
"""Inside the main method, type an opening brace and hit Enter."""
We can see that it automatically sets the corresponding closing brace and also positions the cursor with an indentation.
It also completes every feature that works in pairs.
"""For example, parentheses. Type open  parentheses."""
We can see that we only have to type the open parenthesis and eclipse automatically adds the closing parenthesis.
"""Also note that if we are accustomed to type the closing parenthesis also, then it takes care of it by not adding the extra closing parenthesis."""
I’m now typing the closing parenthesis and note that only the cursor moves to the right and the extra parenthesis is not added.
It works in similar fashion with double quotes also.
Type opening quotes and it automatically closes the  quotes.
"""If we are accustomed to type the closing quotes also, it takes care of it by not adding the extra quote."""
I know typing the quote and notice that the cursor moves to the right with  the extra quote is not added.
Auto-completion is a very versatile feature and helps a lot in maintaining the structure of the code
"""and also prevents typing errors like-  missing closing braces, missing closing parentheses and missing closing quotes."""
The next programming feature we will look at is suggestion.
Remove all that we just typed.
We will type the output statement to print the word “hello”. System dot.
Notice that Eclipse displays a drop-down list.
"""The list contains  suggestions like err, in, out, console  all sought of possible  completion."""
"""Scroll down to out and press Enter. Again, type a dot (.)."""
Now Eclipse will provide suggestions from the out module.
"""Scroll down to  println() and press Enter. Now inside the parentheses, in quotes, type Hello."""
The next feature we will be looking at is the Syntax highlighting feature.
"""Note that the keywords public  class, public static void  are all in a different color."""
Also note that the word Hello is in blue color indicating that this is a string.
This 'syntax highlighting' feature helps us to differentiate between  key words and different parts of the code.
Eclipse also helps the programmer to find out errors.
"""In a program, an error is denoted by a red cross symbol on the left margin."""
"""In this program, we can see there is an error and mouse hover on the error."""
We can see that the error says: semi colon (;) missing and the solution  to resolve the error is also shown.
"""If we proceed to the run without fixing the error, right click, select Run as, Java Application."""
"""We have an Error Dialog Box indicating that there is an error,  asking should we proceed or not."""
"""For now, let us proceed. We notice that there is output indicating that there is an error and"""
"""when we go to problem console, all the problems with possible solutions are listed."""
"""So Let us resolve the error by adding a semicolon. Ctrl, S to save."""
The next programmer friendly feature of eclipse is the 'shortcut-keys'.
The common shortcut-keys in any program are Ctrl+S for saving and Ctrl+O for opening.
Eclipse has shortcut keys for many such commonly used functions.
"""Control, F11 is the shortcut for running the code."""
Let us try it now. Hold Ctrl and press F11 and we see that the code is run and the output Hello has been printed.
The shortcut keys for other options can be found by looking at the menu. Click  Run.
"""And Notice that on the right end of the option, there is a shortcut given."""
So the shortcut key for Debug is F11.
This is just a small but most commonly used list of the programming features of Eclipse. We shall look at more  features in subsequent tutorials.
"""This brings us to the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial, we have learnt how to use programming features of Eclipse such as:"""
Auto completion Syntax highlighting
Error dialog box and Shortcut keys.
As  an assignment for this tutorial:
Write a simple  program with a class that prints “Hello”.
"""In the process, apply all the programming features of Eclipse,"""
observe  the functions.

"""Welcome to  Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""In this tutorial, I will explain you the drawing tools in detail."""
The first drawing tool is Pencil and it works with very hard edges.
"""Here I have drawn a straight line and if I zoom into the image, you can see each pixel is either black or white."""
"""When I select the paint brush for drawing, I get a line which has soft edges."""
"""And when I switch back to zoom, you can see a hard line with visible jaggies when drawn with pencil."""
And when I draw with paint brush I get a soft line.
Back to the pencil here.
You see the pencil is very sharp in the edges and paint brush is smooth.
But you can't see here the jaggies.
This is called trick of the eye.
"""When I enlarge it, you see it here, it's anti-aliased."""
This is the main difference between the pencil and the paint brush.
Otherwise they are nearly equal and their options too.
"""Now, let's start with the paint brush."""
Click on the Paint brush tool in the tool box and you get the options for that.
The Modes are just the same as in the layer modes as you can see here Multiply or Overlay and so on.
Here is the Opacity slider and by using this you can control the visibility and the colour of the line.
"""I slide the value to say 25% and now when I draw, I get a light grey line instead of black."""
And when I cross this line with a new line you can see that the colour gets stronger but it only happens if I go over it with a new line.
I zoom into this part and select a bigger Brush.
"""And now when I draw a line, it's gray."""
And I draw a second line and the intersection of these two lines is dark gray.
"""And now, I draw a third line over here and intersection gets more darker gray but when I paint back with the same line it doesn’t get darker."""
"""So, this works only from stroke to stroke and you can easily paint an area with gray and you don’t have to watch carefully while filling this."""
Here you can see an option called Incremental .
"""When you select Incremental, you get much stronger effect."""
Let's go to the options of the Brushes and here you can see the spacing of this brush is set to 20%.
Brushes is basically a stamp which stamps the same pattern on and on.
"""And when I zoom in here, you can see, after 20% of the size of the brush, there is a next impression of this brush."""
Here each brush overlays itself.
"""When you de-select Incremental option, you can see each stamping of the brush but there is no painting over and I have to start a second line."""
"""And when I select Incremental, I can paint over and over."""
Go back to 100% .
I have covered Opacity and Incremental options.
Let's go back with the opacity with 100% and I can draw again perfect black.
Incremental is meaningful only if you have an opacity lower than 100%.
"""Scale slider controls the size of the pen here and when I slide down to 1, you get a small size of the brush."""
"""When I scale the brush to say 0.05, I can draw a very fine line and I set the slider to say 2 and  I have a broad line."""
Scale basically controls the diameter of the brush and you can also control with the 'square brackets' on the keyboard.
"""With the help of open square bracket, I can reduce the size of brush and with close square bracket, I can increase the size."""
You can see that the brush is nearly invisible.
"""So, I can adjust the size of brush without leaving the area where I paint."""
"""If someone of the GIMP people are looking forward, I would love to have a button to get back the slider to 1."""
"""So, Scale option is covered."""
And I will cover the brush in detail in next tutorial.
"""Here is an option called Pressure sensitivity and I can use it while editing the image. So,"""
"""let's have a look, here, at Opacity."""
"""Now, when I draw without a lot of pressure, you get a line which is gray in colour and when I increase the pressure I get a dark colour and when I decrease the pressure, I get a light coloured line."""
This option is useful if you are painting a mask.
This is quite useful.
Next option is Hardness.
"""When I draw with not much pressure, there is a soft border and when I increase the pressure, the paint brush acts like a pen."""
"""When I select the pencil tool and draw, I get hard border and this can make a hard border if I really press on the tablet."""
I can change the size of the brush with Pressure sensitivity.
I can also change the colour using Pressure sensitivity.
"""So, I select another colour from the background colour, how  this one here?"""
"""So, let's select this red colour."""
"""And for the foreground colour, let's select a nice green."""
"""And when I start painting here with the selected colour, with low pressure I get green and when I am increasing the pressure I get red and if released, I get green or greenish stuff again."""
And in between the colour changes between green and red.
The last option is using colour from the gradients.
"""To select the Gradients, go to File, Dialogs and Gradients."""
Here is the Gradients.
And now I just grab this window and pull it to here and now I have a gradient here.
"""In Gradients, I have a big selection of patterns."""
Let’s select this one and now I go back here.
"""Now, when I am painting, the paint goes through this pattern on the gradient."""
It's quite funny for some things like writing or working with gradients.
It looks like made out of tube or so.
These were the options of the gradient.
These options are common for all the tools which use brushes.
"""i.e,  Pencil, the Paint brush, the Eraser and the Airbrush which has some additional options."""
The Ink has no brush but it has lot of the other options.
"""The Clone tool, the Healing tool , the Perspective clone tool and even tools like Blur/sharpen or dodge/burn have the option of brushes."""
"""Now, let's go back to Pencil and Paint brush."""
Just clear this again.
There are some tricks which you can use here.
The first trick is about drawing a line.
When I try to draw a straight line its a bit difficult.
"""But when I first set one point with a click and press the shift key, I get a straight line."""
Here I have a straight line.
"""The next trick is, just set one point and press Shift + Ctrl and now the rotation of my line is locked to 15 degrees."""
And so I can draw easily straight lines with defined angles.
"""So, what a master piece here."""
There is something else that you can do with this Shift key.
"""For that, select the Gradient tool."""
Draw a line with gradient selected and you get lot of different colours.
I select a small Brush and de-select the Gradient tool and select my standard colours.
"""Now, when I press the Ctrl key, I can select a colour from the line I had drawn and you can see, the foreground colour is changed to the blue tone."""
"""So, I can pick a colour, somewhere out of the image which is quite nice."""
And if you want to paint in something in a picture and it has the colour you need.
Just Ctrl click on it and you have that specific colour on your pallet.
That is a nice trick.
Basically the Eraser tool is the same tool as the pen or the Brush because it's just the opposite of them.
The Eraser also paints but it gives the background color.
You can see it here.
"""But, for that, you should de-select the Pressure  sensitivity and Opacity."""
"""When I just switch the Foreground colour and the Background colour to black and white and switch white as the foreground colour and select the Pen, I can get the same effect as the Eraser."""

"""Hi, welcome to this spoken tutorial on General Purpose Utilities in Linux."""
"""In this tutorial, we will make ourselves acquainted with some of the most basic yet heavily used commands of Linux."""
The main motivation of this is to give you a head-start about working with Linux.
"""The first command that we will see is the echo command. However, note that linux commands are case sensitive."""
"""Here, all commands and their options are in small letters unless otherwise mentioned."""
This command is used to display some message on the screen. Switch to the terminal.
A general procedure to open a terminal is already explained in another spoken tutorial.
Type at the prompt: echo space Hello World and press Enter.
This prints the customary Hello World message on the screen.
We can also use the echo command to display the value of a variable.
Type at the prompt: echo space dollar SHELL in capital and press Enter.
This outputs the present shell being used.
We can also use escape sequences with echo command.
"""For this, in Linux we need to use the -e (hyphen e) option."""
"""Common escape sequences include \t (backslash t) for tab,  (backslash n) for new line and \c (backslash c) is a escape sequence which when used, causes the prompt to be displayed on the same line."""
This can be useful if say we want a prompt message before entering something.  Type at the prompt echo space minus e within single quote  Enter a command \c (backslash  c) and press Enter.
We will see that the prompt will be displayed after printing Enter a command on the same line.
You may want to know what version of Linux Kernel you are running.
"""To know this and many other characteristics of our machine, we have the uname command. Type at the prompt: uname space hyphen r and press Enter."""
"""To know what is your username, type at the prompt: who space am space I  and press Enter."""
"""This in fact comes from the who command that enlists all the users currently logged into the system, in case your system is a multi-user system."""
Sometimes your login password may get compromised and/or you may want to change it.
"""For this, we have the passwd command. Type at the prompt: p a s s w d and press Enter."""
"""When you type this command, you would be asked to type the current password."""
"""Here, I would be typing my system's current password."""
"""When that is correctly entered, you will have to enter your new password and then retype it to confirm."""
"""But, what if we have forgotten our current password?"""
Then also the password can be changed without knowing the current password  but that can only be done by the root user.
Now who is a root user?
He is a special user with extra privileges.
"""To draw an analogy, we can say a root user is similar to a user in Windows with Administrator status."""
We may be interested in knowing the system date and time. For this we have the date command.
Type date in the terminal and press Enter.
It will show you the present system time and date.
"""As we can see, the date command gives both date and time. This is a very versatile utility and has many options as well."""
Type at the prompt: date space plus  % (percentage sign) capital T  and press Enter.
"""It gives us only the time in hours, minutes and seconds (hh:mm:ss) format."""
Type at the prompt: date space plus %(percentage sign) small h and press Enter.
It gives the name of the month.
Type at the prompt: date space +%(plus  percentage sign) small m and press Enter.
"""It gives the month of the year in numerical format. Here, it is showing 02 for the month of February . Match this according to the output you are getting."""
Type at the prompt: date space +% (plus percentage sign) small y and press Enter.
It gives the last two digit of the current year.
"""We can combine these options as well. For example, type at the prompt: date space plus within double quotes percentage small h percentage small y and press Enter."""
"""Here, it is showing February 11."""
"""Another related command is the cal command. Though not as common, this helps you to see the calender of any month and any year."""
"""To see the current month's calendar, type at the prompt: cal and press Enter."""
"""To see the calendar of any arbitrary month- say December 2070, type at the prompt: cal space 12 space 2070 and press Enter."""
This gives the calendar of December 2070.
"""Before moving ahead, let us discuss a little bit about files and directories."""
"""In Linux, almost everything is a file. Now the question is what is a file?"""
"""In real file, a file is where we store our documents and papers. Similarly, a Linux file is a container for storing information."""
"""Next, what is a directory?"""
A directory can be understood as a collection of files and other (sub)directories.
A directory helps us in organizing our files in a systematic manner .
This is like what we call folders in Windows.
"""When we login into the Linux system, we are by default in a home directory. To see the home directory, type at the prompt:  echo space dollar HOME (in capital) and press Enter."""
"""The next command helps us to see the directory we are currently working in. It is pwd, that stands for present working directory. Type at the prompt: pwd and press Enter."""
"""Once we know of our directory, we would also want to know what are the files and sub-directories in that directory. For this, we have the """"ls"""" command which is probably the most widely used command in Unix"
Type the command ls and press Enter.
Now observe the output.
Files and sub-directories are generally shown with different colours.
"""""""ls"""" is a very versatile command and has many options. Let us see some of them. Type at the prompt:  ls  space  minus minus all and press Enter."""
This shows all the files including the hidden files. Hidden files here are file names starting with dot (.).
"""If we not only want to see the file but also get more information, we can use the """"minus l"""" option."""
Just type the command:  ls space minus small l and press Enter.
"""It gives us the file permissions, file owner's name, last modification time, file size in bytes etc. Explanation of the fields of this option is beyond the scope of the present tutorial."""
"""""""ls"""" can be used with many options which we will see later."""
"""Instead of just displaying all these information on the screen, we may store it in a file. In fact we can store the output of any command in a file in this way."""
Just type the command followed by the right angle-bracket and the file name. Say- we write: ls space minus small l space right angle-bracket space fileinfo and press Enter.
"""Now, all the files and directories information will be directed into the file named """"fileinfo""""."""
"""But how do we see the content of this file? For this, we have the cat command. Just type: cat space and the name of the file, here it is """"fileinfo"""", and press Enter."""
"""Now, you can see its contents. In fact, the other main use of cat is to create a file. For this, type at the prompt: cat space right angle- bracket space filename say file1 and press Enter."""
"""Now when we press Enter, the command waits for input from the user."""
"""Whatever we type, would be written into the file; so type some text."""
"""Now, press Enter key to indicate the end of input."""
"""Now, press the Ctrl and D keys together."""
"""If a file by name say """"file1"""" already exists then the user input will be overwritten on this file."""
"""Now, if you wish to append to the end of an existing file file1, type at the prompt: cat space double right- angle bracket space file1 and press Enter."""
"""There are several other commands that we could have discussed but we would keep it to this for now. In fact, even for all the commands discussed, there are many options and possibilities untouched here."""
"""This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial. Spoken Tutorials are a part of the """"Talk to a Teacher"""" project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""

Welcome to the   tutorial on Errors and Debugging using Eclipse.
"""In this tutorial, we are going to learn:"""
"""what are the possible errors  while writing a simple Java program,"""
how to identify those errors and rectify them using eclipse.
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.10 and Eclipse 3.7."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create and run a Java Program in Eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorial, please visit our website as shown. [1]"""
"""In a simple  Java program, the  typical errors could be:"""
Missing semicolon(;)
"""Missing double quotes("""" """") around the message"""
Mis-match of 'file name' and 'class name' and
Typing the print statement in lower-case.
We shall write a program and then make each of these errors and see what happens in Eclipse.
Here we have the Eclipse IDE and the project used for the  HelloWorld tutorial.
We shall  create  a new  class in the project and use it.  New Class. Let us name the class  ErrorFree and select methods stubs public static void main.
Let us minimize the package explorer. Remove the comments and add the print statement with a few errors.
"""In Eclipse, the line which has the error will be indicated with a red cross mark on the left margin."""
"""In this case, the System.out.println line has an error and hence there is a red cross mark on the left."""
The list of errors is displayed by hovering the mouse over the cross mark.
"""The first error displayed is: syntax error, insert  semi-colon to complete block statements."""
This is because we have to end every statement  of a  program with a semicolon.
"""So, let us insert  semicolon at the end of the statement."""
Save the file with Ctrl s.
"""Notice that once we add the semicolon and save the file, the first error is gone."""
There is only one error now which says: Helloworld cannot be resolved to a variable which means to display any message on the console the message has to be included in double quotes.
"""Without the quotes, Java thinks that HelloWorld is the name of a variable."""
Let us add double quotes before and after the message.
"""Ctrl s  to Save. We see that the red-cross mark is gone and the program is error free. So, let us run the program and see what happens."""
Run as > Java application
We see that the message has been printed on the console.
Let us look at the next error.
It happens due to a mismatch of the file name and class name.
It does not  happen usually on Eclipse.
This is because we use the New Class wizard to create a file and eclipse creates a file automatically.
"""But, if we create a Java file outside of Eclipse and add it to a project, there is a chance of the error."""
"""So, let us stimulate the error by changing  the class name."""
"""Since Java is case sensitive, now the class name and file name do not match ."""
Notice that there is a red cross mark on the left margin.
And error message reads: The public type errorfree must be defined in its own file.
Also notice that the word errorfree is underlined in red colour.
Eclipse offers intelligent fixes and we have 2 fixes available here.
The first one is Rename compilation unit to errorfree java.
The second one is Rename the type to errorfree.
"""The fix that we are looking for is the second one. And we see that once you rename the file, the class back to 'ErrorFree', the error here is missing."""
The next error happens due to typing mistakes in the print statement.
Let us replace the capital S with a small s.
We notice that there is the  red-cross mark
and error message reads:  system cannot be resolved.
"""This means, Java is expecting a class or object or a  variable by the name 'system'."""
But there is nothing like 'system' object in the code.
"""So, let us look at the possible fixes."""
"""There are 11 fixes. Out of these, the fix that we are looking for is the eighth option:"""
Change to 'System' (java.lang).
"""You can see that once we change it to capital 'S', the error is missing."""
"""Here is  how you identify errors in Java, using eclipse, and rectify them."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
In this tutorial we have seen:
what are the typical errors while writing a Java program and
how to identify them and rectify them using Eclipse.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial,  find out the errors in the code given below and fix them."""

Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on creating multidimensional arrays in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to- create multidimensional array in awk  and  scan the multidimensional array."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
You can use any text editor of your choice.
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through previous awk tutorials on array, on this website."""
You should have some basic knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
What is a multidimensional array in awk?
"""We know that in single dimensional arrays, an array element is identified by a single index."""
"""For example, array week is identified by a single index, day."""
"""However, in multidimensional array, an element is identified by a sequence of multiple indices."""
"""For example, a two dimensional array element is identified by a sequence of 2 indices."""
"""Here, multiple indices are concatenated into a single string, with a separator between them."""
The separator is the value of the built-in variable SUBSEP.
The combined string is used as a single index for a simple one dimensional array.
"""For example, suppose we write multi within square brackets 4 comma 6 equal to value in double quotes."""
"""Here, multi is the name of multi-dimensional array.  Then, the numbers 4 and 6 are converted to a string."""
"""Suppose, the value of SUBSEP is hash symbol (#)."""
"""Then, those numbers are concatenated with a hash  (#) symbol between them."""
"""So, the array element multi within square brackets within double quotes 4 hash 6 is set to value within double quotes."""
The default value of SUBSEP is the string within double quotes backslash 034.
It is actually a nonprinting character. It will not appear usually in most input data.
Let us try to declare a two dimensional array as shown in the slide.
Row 1 contains two elements A and B.
Row 2 has two elements C and D.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you have downloaded and extracted the Code Files using 'cd' command.
"""Now, define the array as follows. Type the command carefully as shown here. Then press Enter."""
"""We get a command prompt back without any error. So, the array is defined."""
We do not get any output because we have not given anything to print in the code.
Let us add the print statement.
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command in the terminal.
"""Just before the closing curly bracket, type:  semicolon space print space a within square brackets 2 comma 2. Press Enter to execute the command."""
"""Notice, we get the output as capital D."""
How to test if a particular index sequence exists in a given multidimensional array?
We can use in operator.
We have already seen it in single-dimensional array earlier in this series.
We have to write the entire sequence of indices within parentheses and separated by commas.
Let us see this in an example.
I have already written a script named test_multi.awk.
The same is available in the Code Files link of this tutorial page.
I have defined a 2 by 2 array as seen in our previous discussion.
Then I have written two 'if' conditions.
"""The first if condition checks whether the element at the index one comma one, is present or not."""
We have to write the index for multidimensional array within parentheses.
"""If the condition is true, it will print one comma one is present."""
"""Else, it will print one comma one is absent."""
"""Similarly, we will check for the presence of the element at index three comma one. Let us execute the file."""
Switch to the terminal and type: awk space hyphen small f space test underscore multi dot awk and press Enter.
The output says: one comma one is present and three comma one is absent.
"""Let us take one more example. Say, we want to create the transpose of a matrix."""
The transpose of a given matrix is formed by interchanging the rows and columns of a matrix. How can we do this?
I have created a two-dimensional array matrix in the file 2D-array.txt.
I have written a code named transpose.awk.
"""First, look at the action section of this awk script."""
"""Here, we are calculating the maximum number of fields in a row. And, stored the calculated value in the variable max_nf."""
"""As we know, NR is the number of current records processed by awk. Value of NR is stored in max_nr variable."""
Awk will process the input file from the first record to the last record.
"""When awk is processing the first record, max_nr will be equal to 1."""
"""While processing second record, max_nr will be 2 and it continues this way."""
"""When awk is processing the last record, max_nr will store the total number of records."""
"""Now, we should read the data from input file and store the data into a two dimensional array."""
"""Inside the 'for' loop, we have iterator variable x."""
x will traverse from one to NF and x will be incremented by 1 after each iteration.
"""For every value of x, $x(dollar x) represents the value at field x."""
That value will be stored in array matrix at index NR comma x.
"""For example, matrix of 1 comma 1 stores the value which is present at index 1 comma 1 from the input file."""
"""So, after awk has processed the entire input file with this code, matrix array will be completely formed."""
It will store entire data of input file into a two dimensional array format.
"""Now, let’s us look inside the END section."""
We have written a nested for loop to print the transpose of the matrix.
"""I assume your familiarity with basic C programming. So, I am not explaining this portion of code in detail."""
Pause the video here to look at the code in detail and understand on your own.
"""Now, we will learn how to scan a multidimensional array."""
Awk does not have a multi-dimensional array in the truest sense.
"""So, there cannot be any special 'for' statement to scan the multidimensional array."""
You can have multidimensional way to scan an array.
You can combine the 'for' statement with the split function for this.
Let us see what the split function is. split function is used to chop up or split a string into pieces
and place the various pieces into an array.
The syntax is as follows. First argument contains the string to be chopped.
Second argument specifies the name of the array where split() will put the chopped pieces into.
The third argument mentions the separator that will be used to chop the string up.
"""The first piece is stored in  arr 1,"""
the second piece in arr 2 and so forth.
"""Suppose, we want to recover the original sequence of indices from an already created array. How can we do this?"""
I have written a code named multi_scan.awk.
Entire code is written inside the BEGIN section.
First we have created an array named a and assigned these values to it.
Then we have the for loop with an iterator.
"""The iterator will be set to each of the indices values for each iteration- say, 1 comma 1, then 1 comma 2 and so on."""
The  split() function breaks the iterator into pieces separated by SUBSEP.
The pieces will be stored in the array arr.
"""So, arr[1] and arr[2] will contain the first index and second index respectively. Let us execute this  file."""
Switch to the terminal and type- awk space hyphen small f space multi underscore scan dot awk  and press Enter.
See the output; the original sequence of indices are recovered.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt to- create a multidimensional array in awk and scan a multidimensional array."""
"""As an assignment, write an awk script to  rotate a two dimensional array by 90 degree and print the rotated matrix."""

"""To learn this series, you must have knowledge of:"""
Core Java using Netbeans IDE and
"""HTML. If not, for relevant tutorials please visit our website."""
"""Now, let us look at the web application – the Library Management System."""
A library management system is a system which
manages the issuing and returning of books
and manages the users of a library.
"""Now, Why do we need a Library Management System?"""
The use of such a system helps:
The librarian to manage the books in the library easily
To maintain membership information on one centralized server
To save time and resources and
To reduce the workload.
"""Now, let me quickly show you the system."""
"""For this, I will switch to Netbeans IDE."""
We have a very simple system here.
Let me run this Project named MyFirstProject.
The browser window opens.
We can see the Home Page of Library Management System.
We can see a very simple login form here.
There is a link to a page called Visitor’s Home Page.
Click on the link.
We can see the list of all the books available in the library.
A library has many members.
"""So now, let us login as a member i.e. as a user who has registered already."""
I will login as “mdhusein” and give the password and press Enter.
We can see a Success Greeting Page.
"""We also have the list of books, currently borrowed by the user."""
Let us logout now.
"""Next, we shall login as the librarian i.e. as admin."""
"""As soon as we login, we can see the Admin Section page."""
We can see 4 options here.
Let us try each one and see the results.
"""First, we have the option List Books."""
"""Here, we get the list of all the books available in the library."""
"""Next, we have List Borrowed Books."""
"""Here, we get the list of books issued to different members"""
and the  list of books which are past their return date.
Then we have the option List Users.
"""Here, we get the list of all the users who have registered in the library."""
"""Then, we have the option to Checkout/Return a Book."""
Let’s click on this option.
This is the interface to Checkout/Return Book.
"""Now, let us come back to our login page."""
Notice that we also have an option to register as a new user.
Click on here to register.
This is the registration form to register as a new user.
"""So, this is the overview of this simple web application."""
"""At the end of this series, you will be able to create this simple Library Management System."""
"""You will also be able to add more functionality to it, like searching for a book."""
In this series: we will be using JSP and servlets to build the web application.
you will also learn the MVC architecture in detail and
you will be able to develop any web application which follows the MVC pattern.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on String Library Functions in C.
In this tutorial we will learn String Library Functions.
We will do this with the help of some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using ""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10, gcc Compiler Version 4.6.1."
Let us start with an introduction to string library functions.
These are the group of functions implementing operations on strings.
"""Various operations such as copying, concatenation, searching etc are supported."""
Let us see some of the string library functions.
Here we have the strncpy function.
"""The syntax for this is strncpy(char str1, char str2, and int n );"""
It copies first n characters of string str2  into string str1.
"""example, char strncpy( char hello, char world, 2);"""
The output will be Wollo .
Here we have Wo from the string 2 and rest of the characters from string 1.
"""Now we will see strncmp function, the syntax for this is strncmp(char str1, char str2, and int n);"""
It will compare first n characters of string 2 with string 1.
"""example int strncmp(char ice, char icecream, and  2);"""
The output will be 0.
Now we will see how to use the string library functions.
I am going to show you some of the commonly used string functions.
"""I have already typed the program on the editor,"""
"""Here, we have the string length function."""
Note that our file name is strlen.c.
"""In this, we will find the length of the string."""
These are the header files as stdio.h and string.h.
Here we have a character variable  'arr'.
It stores a value  'Ashwini' .
Then we have an integer variable len1 .
Here we will find the length of the string using strlen function.
The result will be stored in 'len1'.
Then we print the string and the length of the string.
Now let us execute the program.
"Open the terminal window by pressing ""Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type:  """"gcc""""  space  """"strlen.c""""  space  “-o” space “str1”.  Press Enter."""
Type (dot slash) ./str1. Press Enter.
The output is displayed as
"""string = Ashwini, Length = 7"""
"""You can count here. 1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7."""
Let us see another string function.
Here we have the string copy function.
Note that our file name is strcpy.c .
"""In this, we will copy the source string into the target string."""
"""Here we have 'Ice' in the source string, it will be copied to the target string."""
This is our strcpy function
Here we will print the source string and the target string.
Let us execute and see.
Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type gcc space strcpy.c space hyphen  o space str2. Press  Enter"""
Type (dot slash)./str2 . Press Enter .
The output is displayed as:
source string = Ice
target string = Ice
Now let us see another string function.
Now we will see the string compare function.
Note that our file name is strcmp.c.
"""In this, we will compare two strings."""
Here we have character variables as str1 and str2 .
str1 stores the value as  'Ice' and str2 stores the value as  'Cream'.
Here we have integer variables as i and j.
In this we will compare the string using the strcmp function.
Here we compare str1 i.e 'Ice' with 'Hello'.
The result is stored in i.
In this we will compare string2 i.e 'Cream' with 'Cream'
The result is stored in j.
Then we print both the results.
To compile type gcc space strcmp.c space hyphen o space str3
Type (dot slash) ./str3
"""The output is displayed as 1, 0."""
Here we get 1 and here we get as 0.
Let us come back to our slides.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learned,String library functions-"""
strlen()
strcpy()
strcmp() strncpy()
and strncmp().
"As an assignemnt, write a C Program to concatenate String 'best' and String 'bus'."
"""Hint: strcat(char str1, char str2);"""
Also explore the other functions in string library.

"""Here, the keyword function is mandatory."""
"""To call a function, write the name of the function followed by the arguments in parentheses."""
Note: space is not allowed between the function name and the open parentheses of the argument.
We will see one example now.
"""In our awkdemo.txt file, the sixth field represents stipend."""
Assume that stipend is either zero or consists of four digits.
"""Suppose, stipend is 8900. Print it as 8 thousand 9 hundred in words."""
"""If stipend is 0, print as zero in words."""
I have already written the code in a file named user_function.awk
"""Here, I have written a function named changeit with a single argument 'argval'."""
"""Here, argval is basically our sixth field which is stipend."""
"""Inside the function, the first code will check if argval is zero or not."""
"""If yes, it will print “Zero” in words."""
"""If not, then  else part of the code will be executed."""
"""In the else part, first we will extract each digit one by one using the substring function."""
"""And, we'll store the values in an array a at different indices."""
For example- a[1]  will give the first digit from left hand side or the thousand’s place digit.
"""Since we have only four digits, I have used four indices."""
"""Next, we will check whether the elements are not equal to zero. And print them in a proper order."""
"""At the end, we print a backslash n character to provide a new line break in the output."""
"""Then, inside the awk script, we have printed dollar 2 which is the second field that is name."""
Then we call the function changeit with the parameter dollar 6 which is stipend. Let’s execute the file.
"""Switch to the terminal. Next, go to the folder where you have downloaded and extracted the file using cd command."""
"""Now, type the following command and press Enter."""
We get the output as expected.
An user-defined function can also include a return statement.
This statement returns control to the calling part of the awk program.
It can also be used to return a value for use in the rest of the awk program.
"""It looks like this: return space expression. Here, the expression part is optional."""
Let’s write a function to return average of an array.
I have written the code in the file average.awk Let’s view the contents.
We have defined a function named avg for this purpose.
It has five parameters. arr is the array for which the average is to be calculated.
i is array loop variable.
sum is the summation of all array elements.
n indicates the number of elements in array.
ret represents the variable to be returned from the function avg. ret will store the calculated average.
"""The extra space before i indicates that the variables i, sum, n  and ret are local variables."""
"""Actually, the local variables are not intended to be arguments."""
You should follow this convention when defining functions.
"""Inside the for loop, we have calculated the total number and summation of array elements."""
We have calculated the average by dividing summation with the total number of elements and stored that value in variable ret.
This function avg() returns the value of the variable ret.
"""Inside the BEGIN section, we have defined array nums with 5 different numbers."""
"""In the print statement, we call the function avg() with one argument which is the array name."""
"""So, you do not have to pass local variables as arguments."""
Switch back to the terminal. Let me clear the terminal.
Type the following command- awk space hyphen f space average dot awk. Press Enter.
We get the output as 3.6. You can validate it by using a calculator.
Let us look at one more example.
I have written a code to reverse a string and named it as reverse.awk. recursive function is used to reverse a string.
Pause the video here and look at the code to understand how the control flows. Then execute it to see the output.
"""As an assignment, use the function rev to reverse the Roll number field in awkdemo.txt file."""
"""For example, if the roll number is A001, output should be 100A."""
The code for the same is provided as reverse_roll.awk in the Code Files link.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learnt about- syntax of function definition,"""
function call and Return statement.
As an assignment- Write a function to create a transpose of a 2D matrix.
Write a function to return the minimum value element from an array.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on how to add an Item type in the Koha interface.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about Item types and  how to add an Item type."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux Operating System 16.04 and   Koha version 16.05."""
"""To follow this tutorial, learner should have knowledge of Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have Koha installed on your system."""
"""And, You should have Admin access in Koha. If not, please refer to the Koha spoken tutorial series on this website."""
Let us begin. Let me switch to the Koha interface.
Recall that we had created a Superlibrarian Bella.
We will now login with username Bella and her password.
Now we are inside the Koha interface as Superlibrarian Bella.
"""Before we move ahead, let’s first understand what are Item Types."""
"""Item types typically refer to the material in the library, such as- Books, Journals, CDs/DVDs etc."""
Every Item type in Koha has a Collection code assigned to it.
This code uniquely identifies that Item type.
Let us learn to add a new item type.
"""On the Koha Home page, click on Koha Administration."""
Go to the section Basic parameters and click on Item Types.
Click the ' New Item Type' button at the top of the Item types administration page.
"""In the Item type field, enter a code for the new item type that you want to add."""
I will type REF.
The Description field is the description of the item type.
"""So here, I will type """"Reference"""". I will skip Search category field."""
Next is Choose an icon:.
Click on the tab bridge .
"""Here, from the below given options, click on the icon to be associated with the item type."""
I will select this Reference icon.
"""Next, we will learn how Hide in OPAC: helps."""
Let’s say a book is damaged and/or has to be kept back for binding purpose.
"""In such cases, the option Hide in OPAC, will make the book invisible to all the users."""
"""As per your requirement, check or uncheck the checkbox for Hide in OPAC:. I will leave the checkbox blank."""
Use the 'Not for loan' option for items which are kept in the library but not circulated.
"""For e.g :  Reference books,  Rare books , Dictionary etc."""
"""You may enter an amount to be charged in the Rental charge field, if you wish to. Particular items in the library may have to be charged a minimum rental fee."""
"""I will not enter any fee, as rental fee is not required to be charged on most items."""
"""If you wish to enter a fee, then remember to enter a valid number only."""
Next is the 'Checkin message:' text field.
Checkin message depends on the type of the particular item.
"""The options could be- Book ,  Serial, Cds/DVDs,  Bound Volume,  Microfilm etc."""
"""In the field Checkin message:, I will type Bound Volume."""
This is followed by Checkin message type:.
"""Depending upon the item type, select a message or an alert for the item."""
"""Remember, as per the selected option a message or an alert will be displayed when check-ins are done for this particular item."""
I will select- message.
Next is SIP media type. SIP media type applies only if a sorter or a locker facility is being used in your library.
"""So here, I’am skipping SIP media type."""
"""In the Summary field, write a summary of the respective item , if you want to."""
I will type- Item type- Reference Facilitate- Self check out/return.
"""Lastly, click on Save changes button."""
A new page Item types administration opens up.
"""All the details that were filled for the new item type, appear in a tabular form  on the page Item types administration."""
Some important things to note are-
Collection codes assigned to item types cannot be edited.
"""Description of the item type can be edited.  Once an item type is used by items in the library, it cannot be deleted."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt-  about Item types and  how to add an Item type."""
As an assignment- add a new item-  Book and   Serial  to your library.
The video at the following link summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project. Please download and watch it.
Please post your timed queries in this forum.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Default constructor in java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
About the default constructor.
And  to create a constructor.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 Java Development Environment jdk 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create a class and the object of the class in java using eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown.http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
Constructor is used to initialize the instance variables.
It is called at the creation of new object.
Let us now see how a constructor is defined in java.
"""So, in the eclipse, I have already created a java file  Student.java."""
In the Student class we will declare two variables.
So type int roll_number semi-colon and String name semicolon.
Now let us create a method.
"""So, type: void studentDetail()."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: System dot out dot println roll_number;"""
Then System dot out dot println name;.
Now in main method we will call this method.
"""So, let us create an object and call the method."""
"""So, type: Student object name stu equal to new Student()."""
Then stu dot method name i.e studentDetail.
We see the output 'zero' and 'null'.
"""So, the int variable roll_number has been initialized to its default value 'zero'."""
And the String name has been initialized to its default value 'null'.
If we do not define a constructor then a default constructor is created.
Default constructor has no parameters.
It initializes the instance variables to their default value.
Now let us define a constructor.
"""So, type: Student S capital parenthesis and curly brackets."""
"""Remember, the Constructor has the same name as the 'class name' to which it belongs."""
Constructors are also similar to methods but there are some important differences.
We see the same output.
This is because the constructor  that we defined is same as having no constructor.
"""But here, no default constructor is created because we have defined a constructor."""
"""Now, let's give values to our variables."""
"""So, inside the constructor type: roll_number equal to ten semicolon."""
And name equal to within double quotes Raman.
Now  Save and Run the program.
We see in the output that the roll_number  is ten and the name is Raman.
"""So, the constructor initializes the instance field."""
"""Now, let us see some differences between  method and a constructor."""
Constructor does not have  a return type.
whereas method has a return type.
Constructor is called using the new operator.
whereas the  method is called using the dot operator.
"""So, these were some differences between constructor and method."""
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
About the default constructor.
To define a constructor.
And Differences between method and constructor.
"""For self assessment, create a class Employee with variables and a  method to display variables."""
And create a constructor for the class Employee.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on presentation using Latex and Beamer.
Let me first explain the arrangement that I have on the screen.
"""I have the source file here, I will do the compilation here using pdflatex command"""
and the resulting output will be seen here in this corner.
"""First let's see this, we will come back to this shortly."""
"""Let's do this first. The first slide here, comes from this source – begin frame, end frame, title page."""
"""And the title page is defined in terms of title, author and date."""
"""The document class that I am using is """"beamer"""". We have begun the document here."""
"""Alright, this is the first slide. Let's go to the second one. This is the outline. How is this created?"""
"""Begin frame, end frame define one slide. Frame title is """"outline"""". It comes here."""
Then I use the normal itemized command. Let’s go to the third slide.
This slide talks about other spoken tutorials on Latex. There are many spoken tutorials on Latex already available.
You are encouraged to see them in case you are not comfortable in using latex.
"""These explain how to use latex, this explains how to install and run latex on Windows."""
And we hope to give more permanent links for all of these from fosse dot in.
"""So, this is the source for this slide."""
You can see that we have come to the end of this document.
Now I’m going to show you how to embellish this document with lots of other features that beamer offers.
"""Let’s go to the beginning. Let’s go to the top of this file. Now what I am going to do is, whatever change,"""
whatever improvement that I am going to make to this are here. I am going to add one at a time and then explain.
Let’s see what happens when I add this command - beamer theme split.
"""Let me cut it, come back here, let me save it and then compile it – pdflatex beamer."""
Let me go and click this. So you can see that it has created this banner here and some banner here.
"""Here also.. alright. Then what we do is, you come here and use the package."""
"""Let's add this – beamer theme shadow. Let me cut it, go here, paste it. All of these are pasted above the """"document"""" command."""
"""Let me compile this. Alright, let’s see what happens when I click this. It has become bigger."""
"""You can see that there is a change of color here. So, this is done by the command – beamer theme shadow."""
There are lots of these packages. I am going to illustrate some of the other features now.
"""We will give references for future reading as a part of this introduction, as we see here – ‘References for further reading’."""
"""The outline of this talk is as follows. We will spend some time on title page, author name, color, logo etc."""
"""""""Minimal animation"""" that you can use to present your talk, """"Two column format, Figures and Tables, Equations, Verbatim"""" and so on."""
"""Alright, let’s come back to the beginning. The next one is logo. Let’s cut and paste logo from here."""
"""This also has to be pasted above the begin document command. This logo, let’s see what this looks like."""
Let me just see it by open iitb logo.pdf. I am giving the same name over here.
"""When I open it, you can see that this is the image file that I am talking about."""
"""On including this """"logo"""" command, of height 1 cm. it is going to come in this corner."""
So let’s see what it looks like. Let’s click this. You can see that iitb logo has come.
"""Now this is going to come on every page, from now on."""
"""Next, we will add this command. For presentations, sometimes it is useful to make all the lettering bold."""
"""So in view of that, I will include this, cut, paste."""
Actually I will have to include this after the begin document command.
"""Let me save this. Let me compile it. Alright now, watch this. As I click this, all the letters will become bold."""
You can see that it has become bold.
"""Then, now I am going to improve the writing here."""
"""For example, it tries to fill lots of things here. Here, the title comes here, here the author information comes but lots of information is coming."""
"""Sometimes I may want to have a smaller title here. For example, this space may not be large enough."""
"""So what we will do is, that is solved using this."""
"""For example, this is the running title."""
"""Let me cut this. This should come after the command title, between the title command and the actual title."""
"""So, let me paste it here. You can see that whatever I have pasted now is within square brackets."""
So let’s save it. Run it.
"""So, as I do it, let’s click this. Look at this as I click what happens to this part."""
"""You can see that the title has now changed. I have put only the bottom portion because that’s what I’m giving within the square bracket – """"Presentation using LaTeX and Beamer""""."""
Then I am saying that h-space is half a cm. I am giving a space here. And then I have the page number over here.
It says 1 by 3 here. Then 2 by 3 here. 3 by 3 here and so on.
That is achieved using ‘insert frame number divided by insert total frame number’.
"""Now, I will do the same thing for author. So, let's come here."""
"""Let’s cut this. And after author, this comes."""
Let me save it. Compile it. Click this.
You can see that Kannan Moudgalya has come. This is what I have given within the square brackets. Now this is going to come on every page.
Let’s go to the next topic. This is including equations.
The whole thing is in the form of a frame – a complete frame.
"""So, what I will do is, I will cut the whole thing."""
"""Come back here, go to the bottom of this document. Save it."""
"""So, I have created a new slide. Let’s see what this looks like."""
So this is where the frame starts.
"""Let us compile this. Now you see that 4 pages are there. So, it still says three, so if I click this once more, so it becomes 4."""
So this is the equation containing slide. I am not going to explain how to write these equations.
These are explained in the spoken-tutorial that I have created earlier on creating equations.
"""All that I have done is, I went to that latex document, cut and pasted it here, that’s all."""
And.. of course I have removed the equation numbers. It does not make sense to give equation numbers in a slide.
"""On the other hand, it may be useful for you at times to highlight the color."""
"""For example- if I want to change this into blue, I will do the following. Come here."""
"""The command is – color, blue- and then I have to close this."""
Save it. Compile it. And click this. You can see that this has become blue.
"""So, you may not want to refer to an equation by numbers but you can say that consider the equation in blue or you may want to say that look at the mass balance equation and so on."""
You want to refer to it by something that people can remember in talks.
"""Next what we will do is, what I will do now is to include animation"""
which is useful to present information concept by concept.
"""So I have cut, let's paste it here. Let us see what this looks like."""
Let's first compile it and see what happens.
This is from the spoken tutorial on letter writing. This information is also there.
"""The only difference that I have done now is that between begin enumerate and end enumerate, I have put this ‘item plus minus alert’."""
"""Let’s see what this does. See, here I have put a command called ‘pause’, so the moment I put a command pause, it stops there, now the begin enumerate starts."""
"""So, let me just go forward. Page-down. Next page, next page, next page."""
"""As I go down, you see that the latest information is in red, all others are in the default color namely black. I have come to the end of the document."""
"""So, this is one easy way to create animation where you want to present information a little at a time."""
"""Next what I want to do is- change the alerted color to blue. For example, here the alerted color is red, this is known as alerted color."""
I want to make this alerted color blue. So that this is consistent with this color that I have chosen.
"""Okay, let me come here, cut this."""
This should go to the beginning of this document before the begin document command.
"""Let me compile it, when I click this you can see now that the alerted color has now become blue."""
"""It is achieved through the command ‘set beamer color – alerted text’ there is a space here ‘foreground equals blue’, fg equals blue."""
"""Now what I am going to do is- to show,  how easy it is to change the color of the entire document."""
"""So, what I will do is.. will come here, after this slash document class, before the beamer frame starts. I will write here """"brown""""."""
Save it. Compile it.
You can see that it has become brown. So without too much work.
"""So what I will do is, I will take this back to the original color."""
"""The default color is blue, so I don’t have to type it. Now we are back in blue."""
"""So let’s come here, I will delete this. I will now include figures."""
Cut this. Come here. Go to the end of this.
"""The last one. Let’s compile it. Let’s go to the next page. So, example of the figure is given here."""
"""Alright, what are the guidelines in placing this? There are some important guidelines. We will see it with the next bit."""
Let’s cut this. Paste this. Compile it.
"""So, I have got this. """"Hints for including figures""""."""
"""Let’s come to the source where we created the figure. This is how we created this figure. So, what are the guidelines?"""
"""""""Do not use floated environments in presentations"""". for example, don’t say 'begin figure, end figure' which you need in the latex documents."""
"""By the way, if you want to know about how to include a figure and more about it you have to go to the spoken tutorial on Tables and Figures."""
"""So, do not use this. Use ‘include graphics’ directly."""
"""So, for example, include graphics command is used and I’m saying that use the complete width of the text and the file is 'iitb'."""
"""By the way, Beamer already comes with necessary packages. So, you don’t have to include any package. Use any package, it is already included."""
And then we put the whole thing in the center environment. And this frame is over.
"""Do not include caption, figure number etc."""
Once again people are not going to remember these numbers.
"""If you want to refer to a previously shown figure, show it again."""
It does not cost any money to create another slide. Make a copy of the earlier shown slide and do it again.
"""Alright, that completes the figure and the guidelines. And we have come to the end of this document."""
Let us now see how to include a two column environment.
Let’s come here. Let’s go to the end of the document. Save it.
"""What I will do is to make it easier, I will first remove this so that it becomes easy."""
"""So, what I’m going to do is- I’m going to give, show part of the information. Let’s compile this and see what happens."""
"""So I have this, two columns."""
"""This is not saved, that is why. See the star star. What I will do is, let me first save it."""
"""So, this is the problem if you try to compile it without saving. The pdf file that you see here, does not correspond to what you have here."""
"""So, let’s compile this. Let’s come here. Now what you see here corresponds to what you have here."""
"""Let me just center it. So, frame title 'Two Columns' and I’m using the command ‘mini page’ and I’m centering it and I’m using 45 percent of the text width."""
begin enumerate. These two and then end enumerate. And as before I am alerting.
"""See these two. This is the end of the document. Now what I will do is, I will come and attach whatever I had at the end of this."""
"""Here, the previous 'mini page' got over. Now I am going to create another mini page. In this 'mini-page', I am going to put this iitb, the same image that we saw earlier."""
"""And this mini-page also is 45 percent size. Let’s compile this, let’s first save this."""
"""Now let me click this. Now you see it has come. But it has a small problem in that. When I go to this page, it shows the first item and also this figure."""
"""Although the figure comes later on, it shows this because no where have we told latex to show this later. It is perhaps implicit."""
"""So for example, if you say that, if you put this information within this item then we say that show this first and then show this."""
But no where are we saying that this should come later.
So one has to be careful of such evinces. One way to solve this problem is to put a ‘pause’.
Let me compile this. Save this. So now this is okay.
"""This problem is solved. The first one, the second one, and then one more, it pauses once. And, you can see that it has been solved."""
"""Alright, let’s come here. The next one is the table."""
Save this. Let’s compile this. You can see that the table has come.
"""I am not going to explain how to create this table, this has already been explained in the spoken tutorial on tables."""
All that I have done is to cut and to paste it here. Let’s go to the beginning of the frame.
"""It’s the same table that we used earlier, I just cut and pasted it. You can see the begin tabular and end tabular commands coming within center environment."""
OK..What are the guidelines? The guidelines are similar to figures.
"""So, let’s see that also. See the guidelines are here."""
"""Let me compile. See this, move forward."""
"""Once again, do not use floated environments in presentations."""
"""In the spoken tutorial on tables, we put the tabular inside the table environment."""
"""Table environment is a floated one, do not include it here. Insert it directly."""
"""For example, we put it directly inside the center environment."""
"""Do not include caption, table number etc. make a copy of it, if required."""
"""Now, here I want to point out the way animation happens. For example, in this slide, it does not alert with a different color."""
Recall that we used the blue color for alerting. Why does it happen?
That is because we have used a different kind of environment here.
"""begin itemize, end itemize, within that we used item plus minus. Previously we were using the word 'alert'."""
"""Recall that. We are not using that anymore. As a result, it just comes in black. This is simpler way to include animation."""
"""You can pick and choose. So, this is what I have written here. """"Show different animations in the previous slide""""."""
"""Now, there is a need to convert this into a handout. For example- if you try to print this,"""
"""whatever we have here, it will produce 24 pages even though there are only 10 pages."""
"""There are only 10 unique frames but there are 24 pages. But if you try to print out, it will produce 24 pages."""
"""One way to do that, to take care of this is to use a simple switch here called 'handout'."""
"""If I do this, let me compile it; now there are only 10 pages. Let’s compile this once more."""
"""Now the animation is no longer there. If I go to the next page, next page, next page, next page, next page and so on."""
"""Of course, what if I want to change the color? Then you put 'brown' once again."""
"""You can see that it has changed. So, all the parameters here are to be included separated by commas."""
"""So, let me just put this back to blue. Compile it."""
"""Now what we will do is, sometimes you have to include Verbatim environment."""
"""So, let me just take this example."""
"""Let’s go here, go to the end. Save it. So this is where the verbatim begins."""
So you can see that the verbatim is created.
"""Here, I have illustrated it with some SciLab commands. I have changed the color here to blue, here to blue and so on."""
The only unique thing that you have to do is to say begin frame within square bracket – fragile.
"""If you don’t do that, there will be a problem. Okay.. so you see this, we will come back and check that."""
So suppose I delete this. Save it. Compile it.
It will come and say that something is not okay.
"""So, let's put this back – fragile. Save it, exit from here."""
Compile it once again. It has come now.
Beamer class has lots of information. How does one know about other things.
"""So, I have some information here, let’s go to the bottom."""
"""So essentially that information, where to get this extra information is in this slide."""
"""We will compile it and we will go through that. The authoritative source for beamer is this file, 'beamer user guide dot pdf'."""
I located it at this point but it is also available through this beamer project website by the author of beamer class.
I’ll just illustrate this; I’ve already downloaded this. It’s in that site that I have mentioned earlier.
"""For example, it’s a 224 page document. It’s a huge document."""
What I want to show here is that you can use the information from here directly.
"""So let’s come here. In the very first page, the author talks about how to create simple slides and he has given the source also."""
"""We will cut this, copy, let me minimize this. Let me go to the end of the document."""
We paste it. Save it. Compile it. So let’s go to the next page.
You can see that whatever we saw there has come here. Here the author has used what is known as the theorem environment.
"""So, for example- begin theorem, end theorem, it comes here. He has also used the frame subtitle that comes here in small letters."""
"""And then begin proof, end proof come here. He says 'proof', it opens another window, calls it ‘proof dot’."""
"""This is how it is defined, how this environment is defined. He uses a different alert mechanism."""
"""So if you want to see this, you just go back; remove this handout so that we can see the animation. Compile it."""
So let’s go to page number 34.
"""Let’s see the animation now by going backwards. You see this, you see this."""
"""So what he does here is, so these two items are numbered one, and the others are numbered two and three."""
"""In other words, it is possible to arbitrarily specify the sequence in which the things that you have on the slide will appear."""
We don’t have time to go through this in more detail. I would suggest that you go through the reference given here to know more about it.
"""This guide has lots of features, this beamer class has very large number of classes, and you may want to try out some of them."""
Okay. Let me change this back to handout.
"""The problem with the presentation mode, we are now going to the handout mode,"""
"""the presentation mode where you show the animations, generally takes a lot of time to compile."""
"""So, typically you would want to work with the handout mode as much as possible and only once in a while when you really want to check it out you want to use the presentation mode."""
"""Finally of course, when you make the presentation, you may want to use the presentation mode."""
"""And if you want to take a printout, use the handout mode. Let’s go to the end. We are almost at the end of the spoken tutorial."""
"""Let’s acknowledge. In fact let me just copy the whole thing, come here."""
Let me just compile it here as usual. Okay.
The funding for this spoken tutorial has come from the National Mission on Education through ICT. This is the website of this mission.

Hello everyone.Welcome to the tutorial on Netbeans Debugger.
"""If this is the first time you are using Netbeans, please view the earlier tutorials on the Spoken Tutorial website."""
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System Ubuntu version 12.04"""
and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
We all know that debugging programs can be a rather painstaking task.
"""Hence, knowing a debugging tool and being familiar with its features can help you save valuable time."""
"""This powerful debugging tool is very useful,"""
especially when you have to code or test large programs.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn some of the features that the Netbeans Debugger provides."""
This tutorial will acquaint you with-
the debugging window
configuring breakpoints
evaluating expressions  or setting watches
options for tracing the execution of your program and
options to configure the debugger itself.
"""Now, Let's get started and debug this sample code."""
I will switch to the Netbeans IDE.
"""I have already created a Java Application- sampleDebug, in my IDE, for this demonstration."""
"""This is a small program that initializes three integer values a, b, and c."""
"""Then it prints """"Hello World!"""" and the value of a."""
"""It also creates a class object SampleClass which has a 'value' integer, as a private integer value."""
"""Then, it computes the value of  b"""
"""and calls a function to compute the value of c,"""
and prints the values of b and c.
"""To start with the debugging, let us first set the break-point."""
"""To set a break point, click on the line number."""
"""I will set it at this line which prints """"Hello World!""""."""
"""Notice that the line at which a break-point is set, changes it's colour to pink and is marked by a small square against its line number."""
"""When you run the program in the debugging mode,"""
"""by clicking on the Debug Project button in the toolbar,"""
the execution of the program stops at the line at which the breakpoint is located.
"""So far, as value has been set."""
Hover on it to check it's value.
It indicates that it's value is 10.
You can see that there are some additional windows below the workspace.
There is a 'Variables' window that shows a list of variables and their values.
"""So far, only the variable a has been initialized."""
We can also look at the Output window with the sampleDebug output.
There is no output yet.
There is also a  Debugger Console that says that the program hit a breakpoint on line 29 and has stopped there.
There is also a Breakpoints window that tells you that a breakpoint has been set on line number 29.
"""Before proceeding, let us see how to add a watch."""
"""For example, let us say, I want to watch on the integer value 'aSample'."""
"""In the 'Variables' window, below the workspace, I will double-click on  the Enter new Watch option and enter the name of the variable  """"aSample.value""""."""
Click on OK.
"""So far, aSample has not been created. So, it says it does not know the value."""
"""Once it executes the line, we'll know what the variable contains."""
"""In a similar way, you can also watch and evaluate expressions."""
"""Here, I'm checking for b=a+10."""
What if I wanted to know what a-4 is.
"""So, let me go to the Debug menu in the menu bar and select Evaluate expression option."""
The 'Evaluate Code' window appears in the workspace.
"""Here, I will enter the expression  a-4."""
"""Click on the Evaluate Expression button here and in the Variable window, it says (a-4)'s value is 6."""
Let us now proceed and execute this single line of code.
"""To do that, choose the Step-Over button from the toolbar."""
That should execute only that 1 single line  of the code to print  “Hello World”.
"""To see the output, go to the output window and choose the sampleDebug output window"""
"""that says, """"Hello World! 'a' is 10""""."""
The program has now stopped at the line to create a SampleClass object.
"""Now, I want to go into the constructor of the  SampleClass."""
"""To do that, I can choose the  Step Into option from the toolbar."""
Then I can choose the Step Over and see that the value came inside the constructor call is now set to 10.
You can also check that by hovering over the variable.
"""When I Step Over again, we can see that this.variable is also set to 10."""
"""To get out of this function, I can either choose Continue, Step Over or Step Out."""
Let me choose Step-Out to come out of the method.
"""And, now I'm back to where the function call was made."""
"""When I say Step-Over again, you will notice that aSample.value is now set to 10."""
This is what we were watching for.
"""Apart from Breakpoints and Step Overs, you can also stop the execution of the program at the line of the cursor."""
"""For example, let me go into the function here and set the cursor to be on this line which says d=b-5; ."""
"""Now, from the toolbar, choose the Run To Cursor option."""
You will notice that the execution of the program gets into the function and stops at the line where the cursor is located.
You can see that it has computed the value of b as 20.
"""And inside the Variable window, it has set b to be 20."""
"""Now, I can choose Step Over again and 'd's value also gets initialized and becomes 15."""
"""Now, I can either choose to return or completely finish the execution of the program."""
Let me choose Step Out and come back to the function call.
"""When you hover on the getC() function, you'll notice that the function has returned a value of 15."""
The variable 'c' has not yet been assigned that value.
"""So, when we Step Over and execute that line, c will get a value of 15."""
We can now check it in the Variable window or hover on the variable to check it's value.
"""Now, if you want to stop the debugging session, you can choose the Finish Debugger Session option from the toolbar."""
"""If you want to continue the execution to the next breakpoint, you can choose the Continue option."""
"""Once you finish, you can choose the Continue option to complete the execution of the remaining program."""
Let me choose Continue here.
"""In the Output window, it shows me the output as: b is 20 and c is 15."""
"""Now, this was a quick overview of the options of debugging on netbeans."""
"""If you want any advanced feature settings, you can"""
"""go to Tools menu, click on Options. Go to the Miscellaneous option, click on the Java Debugger tab."""
"""Here, you can change settings for multi-threaded program breakpoint options."""
"""Or, have filters to decide on which methods you would want to step in."""
"""Now, to the assignment.."""
"""As an assignment, take any of your programs, excellent if it has already errors."""
"""If not, introduce some errors with the logic or algorithm."""
"""Set breakpoints in the code. Usually, you would set a break at the calling point of a function which you suspect has the error."""
Use Step Into to go into the function.
Use Step Overs to execute the lines and make sure to inspect the values of variables in the Variable window.
Add some watches to help you identify and correct the error.
Step Out of the method.
Continue till you reach the next breakpoint.
"""And finally, finish the debugger session and run your application."""
"""In this tutorial, we became familiar with the Netbeans Debugger."""
We saw how to set breakpoints and watches.
Add expressions which we want to evaluate while the code is running.
"""Trace the execution of a program with Step-Into, Step-Over, Step-Out and Run-to-Cursor options."""
"""Also, saw how to configure the debugger for advanced debugging."""
Hope this tutorial saves you a lot of time in your testing and debugging tasks.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Set Currency.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to set Currency in Koha."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux Operating System 16.04 and  Koha version 16.05."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have Koha installed on your system. And, you should have Admin access in Koha."""
Please refer to the Koha spoken tutorial series on this website for more details.
"""To start with, Login with Superlibrarian username Bella and her password."""
Then click on Koha Administration.
A new page opens up.
"""Under the section Acquisition parameters, click on Currencies and exchange rates."""
Note that this data is not updated automatically.
"""Therefore, it is important to update the data. This will also help to keep the correct accounting details."""
"""Now, click on plus New currency."""
"""In the new page that opens, fill in the mandatory details like- Currency:, Rate: and Symbol:."""
"""Since my library is in India, I will enter Rupee for Currency, 1 for Rate and  the Rupee (₹) symbol."""
"""Next, enter the ISO code: as INR."""
"""To activate the currency, click the check-box. Last updated shows the date of currency setup."""
Click on Submit button at the bottom of the page.
"""In the new page that opens, under the tab Currency, the details for Rupee appears."""
"""If the need be, the same can be edited as well."""
For Assignment: Set any currency as per your requirement but do not make it 'Active'.
Let’s go back to the Koha interface.
"""On the same page, click on the tab- Column visibility."""
"""From the options, click on the tab ISO code."""
The ISO column for Rupee appears in the table.
Remember that the entered ISO code will be used when importing MARC files via the staging tools.
The tool will attempt to find and use the price of the currently active currency.
"""To edit the Currency, click on Edit option for that particular Currency. I will click on Edit for the currency USD."""
Modify currency page opens up.
You may change the value of Rate and Symbol. I will leave it as they are.
Note that I will not click in the check-box for the field ‘Active’.
An active currency is the main currency to use in the library.
"""Since my library is in India, Rupee will be used as active currency."""
"""Next, click on Submit at the bottom of the page."""
The same page Currencies and exchange rates re-opens.
Now log out from your Koha Superlibrarian account.
"""To do so, first go to the top right corner, click on Spoken Tutorial Library."""
"""Then from the drop-down, select Log out."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Static Methods.
"""In this tutorial we will learn:  what are static methods , defining static methods."""
difference between instance methods and static methods and  how to use static methods.
"""Here we are using  Ubuntu 14.04, JDK 1 .7 and  Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial,  you must have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
"""You should also have the knowledge of instance variables, methods and static variables in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
A static method is a method which is associated with the entire class.
It is also called a class method and is declared using the static keyword.
Static methods are usually used to handle static variables.
Now we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called StaticMethodDemo.
Inside this project we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Static methods.
We will create a new class StudentEnroll.
Let us see how to use static methods with an example.
The example is very similar to the one which is used in the Static Variable tutorial.
Here again we are representing the StudentEnroll class.
Recall that the variables name and id are handled as instance variables.
Here the variables organization and total count are common to the entire class.
So they can be treated as static variables.
Now type the following code to represent the StudentEnroll class.
Note that there are two static variables count and orgname.
Also note that orgname is not a static constant rather it is normal static variable.
The static variable orgname is initialized as “IIT Bombay”.
Now click on Source -> and select Generate Constructor using Fields.
Delete the super keyword from the generated code.
"""Inside the constructor, type count ++ semicolon  So, the count value is incremented every time an object is created."""
Now we will add a method showData( ) to this class to print the values of the variables.
So type public void showData( ).
"""Within brackets type the following code to print the values of id, name and organisation name."""
Now we will add the static method setOrgName.
Type the following code.
The setOrgName method represented here is a static method which can modify the value of orgname.
Any method which is used to handle static variables can be defined as a static method.
Now let us explore the differences between instance method and static method.
Instance methods can access static variables.
Whereas a static method can directly access and modify only static variables.
Instance methods are invoked only by an object.
Whereas a static method can be invoked directly without creating an object.
We cannot use ‘this’ and ‘super’ keyword inside a static method.
This is because these keywords refer to the instance of a particular class.
"""In a static context, we can’t refer to instances of a class."""
Let us see what happens if we try to access an instance variable directly inside this static method.
"""Type,  id= “newid” semicolon"""
Now an error comes up in Eclipse.
It indicates that an instance variable cannot be accessed directly inside a static method.
So let us comment this line and proceed.
Now we will add one more static method showOrgData.
These statements print the values of orgname and count.
"""Now right click on the default package, click New-> Class and then type the name as Demo."""
Inside this class we will have the main method.
So type main and then press Ctrl+space to generate the main method.
We will create a few objects of StudentEnroll class to represent student enrollments.
"""So type the following code to create 3 objects s1, s2 and s3."""
Now let us invoke the showData method to print the enrollment details.
"""Type the following code to invoke showData method on s1, s2 and s3."""
Let us also invoke the method showOrgData to print the values of orgname and count.
Since it is a static method we can invoke it directly using its class name.
"""To do so, type this code."""
Now let us run the Demo program.
"""We can see that the values of the variables corresponding to s1 i.e IT101, ADIL and IIT BOMBAY gets printed."""
Similarly the values corresponding to s2 and s3 are also printed.
"""Note that the value of orgname ie IIT BOMBAY is common for s1, s2 and s3."""
orgname and count are printed separately by the static method showOrgData.
Note that the organisation name is printed as IIT Bombay.
"""The value of the number of student enrollments is printed as 3, as we have already created 3 objects."""
A static method can be invoked directly by the class name itself.
Now let us invoke the static method setOrgName.
We will change the organisation name from “IIT Bombay” to “IIT Mumbai”.
So type the following code.
"""Now let us once again invoke the showData method on s1, s2 and s3 to print the enrollment details."""
For that type the following code again.
"""Once again, let us invoke the method showOrgData to print the values of orgname and count."""
"""To do so, type this code."""
Now run the Demo program again.
We can see that the organisation name is changed to “IIT Mumbai”.
Let us come back to slides.
Object references can be passed to a static method.
This way a static method can access the instance variables of that particular object.
Let us try it in our code.  Switch to Eclipse and go to the StudentEnroll class.
"""Now in the setOrgName method, pass another argument as an object of StudentEnroll class."""
"""So after String org, type  comma StudentEnroll s"""
"""Now inside this method, uncomment id = """"newid"""""""
"""And instead of id,type  s.id"""
Now go to the Demo class.
Let us modify the function call to setOrgName method by passing the StudentEnroll object s1.
"""So here, after “IIT Mumbai”, type comma s1."""
Now run the Demo program again.
We can see that the value of id for s1 has changed to “newid”.
Let us summarize.  In this tutorial we have learnt about
What is a static method and when it is used
How to differentiate static methods and instance methods and
How to create and invoke static methods
This assignment is a continuation of the Static variable assignment.
Make sure that you have completed the Static variable assignment.
We will highlight only the modifications here.
Here we have a variable to represent “status”.
It is used to indicate whether the car is “in” for service or “out” after service
We will also have another variable to represent  No of cars out after Service.
Define a method service( Car c) which updates the status to ”out”.
Accordingly it modifies the values for
No of Cars in for Service  No of Cars out after Service
Also define a method show( ) to print all the car details.
"""As before, we need to perform the following as listed."""
Note that we have to identify and define the static method as required.
Also create a Demo class.
"""Inside the main method, Create a few objects of CarService."""
Invoke the service( ) method on some of them.
Invoke the show( ) method using all the objects and verify the results.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Fill color and stroke using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Fill color in objects Give objects an outline Various types of gradients and  Stroke paint and style."""
"""For this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS Inkscape version 0.48.4"""
"""Let's open Inkscape. For this, go to Dash home and type: """"Inkscape""""."""
You can open Inkscape by clicking on the logo.
Let's open the 'Assignment.svg' file that we created earlier. I had saved it in my Documents folder.
These are the 3 shapes we created in an earlier assignment.
Recall that we had learnt to change color using the color palette at the bottom of the interface.
Now we will learn how to fill colors of various types using Fill and Stroke.
Let's go to Object menu and click on the Fill and Stroke option from the drop-down list.
Notice that the Fill and Stroke dialog box has opened on the right side of the interface.
"""There are 3 tabs in this dialog box: Fill, Stroke paint and Stroke style."""
"""Now, we will click on the rectangle in the canvas area. Observe that the options and icons in the Fill and stroke dialog box get enabled."""
"""First, we will learn about the Fill tab."""
Notice there are 6 icons under the Fill tab. Let us learn what these icons do.
The first icon is called No paint. It indicates that the object will not be filled with any color.
Click on the icon and notice the change in the rectangle. The color of the rectangle has been removed.
The next icon is Flat color. It helps to fill a solid color into an object.
Click on the Flat color icon and observe the change of colour in the rectangle shape.
"""Under Flat color, notice that there are 5 sub-tabs."""
"""By default, RGB tab is selected."""
"""Under 'RGB' tab, there are 4 sliders."""
"""The first 3 sliders indicate the intensity of Red, Green and Blue colours."""
We can change the color by moving these sliders in left or right directions. Observe the color change in the rectangle as I do so.
"""The fourth slider is the Alpha slider. With this, we can increase or decrease the opacity level of the colour, from opaque to fully transparent."""
"""As I move these 4 sliders, observe that the RGBA values of the color shown in these boxes change automatically."""
Let me move the sliders once again so that you can observe this change.
We can change the color manually by changing the values of each color in the boxes at the right of the sliders.
"""Let me change the value of Red to 100, Green to 50 and Blue to 150. Notice the color of the rectangle has now changed to violet."""
I keep the Alpha level as 255 since I do not want to reduce the opacity level.
"""The next tab is HSL and it stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness respectively."""
We can use the Hue slider to get a base color. I move the slider towards the left direction to get a base of green color.
We can adjust the saturation of the base colour using the Saturation slider.
Observe the change in the saturation level by moving the slider in left or right directions.
The Lightness slider adjusts the 'lightness' of the base color.
"""With this option, one can vary the shade of the base colour from pure white to pure black or any shade in-between."""
"""As before, the Alpha slider is used to increase or decrease the opacity level from opaque to fully transparent."""
"""The next tab is CMYK which denotes Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black respectively."""
"""By moving these sliders, we can increase or decrease the intensity or the depth of the base colour."""
This color mixing option is useful when design projects are to be printed on commercial presses.
Next is the Wheel tab. This is an alternative representation of the HSL color mixer.
We can select the base hue by clicking on the color ring that is based on the standard color wheel.
"""So, I will click on yellow shade to select a base of yellow color."""
"""Within the color circle, there is a triangle with a small circle inside it. Just click on it and drag it inside the triangle and observe the color change in the rectangle."""
The CMS tab will only be of real interest to those working in color managed environments.
"""For now, we will skip this tab."""
"""Next, let us learn how to create a Linear gradient."""
Go to canvas and click on the circle.
"""Now, come back to the Fill and Stroke dialog box and click on the Linear gradient icon."""
Observe the gradient fill in the circle.
The gradient will be given a name ending with a series of random numbers.
"""In my interface, the number is linearGradient3794. In yours, it may be different."""
We can change the gradient by clicking the Edit button which is right below the linear gradient number button.
This will open the Gradient editor dialog box.
The top button in this box is named stop followed by some random numbers and it contains a drop-down menu.
"""If you click the arrows on this drop down, you will see two stop options."""
"""The first one denotes the pure base colour. The other one is half checker board, indicating that it's transparent."""
"""Select the second option, that is, the transparent stop option."""
Go to the Stop Color below. Change the RGB values to whichever color you like by moving the sliders.
Keep Alpha value at 255 to make the gradient fully visible. Close the Gradient editor dialog box.
"""Now, we can change the gradient angle. To do so, click on Node tool from the tool box, on the left of the interface. This is located right below the Selector tool."""
This will display a line on the circle. This line represents the gradient.
These currently overlap with the square handle and the arc handles of the circle.
"""We will have to move the gradient line handles a little bit, so that we can see the handles clearly."""
Click and drag the circular handle or the square handle to change the position where the gradient starts and ends.
"""We can also rotate the direction of the gradient by moving the circular handle, as demonstrated."""
"""Now, we will learn how to use Radial gradient. Click on the icon and observe the gradient change in the circle."""
The Radial gradient is formed in a circular shape.
Notice 1 square handle and 2 circular handles.
Click on the middle square handle to move the gradient's starting point. I will move it to the bottom left.
Click and drag on any one of the circular handles to make changes in the gradient.
Observe the change in the height and width of the gradient shape.
We can find the Gradient tool in the Tool box also.
Let's click on it and come back to our circle.
Notice that the cursor has now changed into a plus sign with capital I.
"""Now, click anywhere inside the circle and drag. Notice the change in the gradient."""
"""Now, click anywhere outside the circle and drag."""
Notice the change in the gradient.
"""Next, we will learn how to overlay various patterns on shapes."""
"""Go to Tool box, click on the Selector tool and then click on the star shape."""
"""In the Fill and stroke dialog box, click on the Pattern icon. Notice the color of the star has changed to a stripe pattern."""
There is a drop-down menu under Pattern fill. Click on the arrows to see the available patterns.
Let's click on Checkerboard and observe the change in the star shape.  You can use any of these available patterns shown here.
We will learn about Swatch in another tutorial.
"""The last icon called Unset paint, is used to unset the color of the selected object to black."""
Click on the icon and observe the color change in the star. It has changed to black.
"""Now, let us learn how to give stroke or an outline to an object. To do this, we have to use the Stroke paint tab."""
"""Now, click on Stroke paint tab and click on the rectangle."""
The icons under the Stroke paint tab are the same as the Fill tab.
They function in the same manner as well.
"""With the first icon, that is No paint, we remove the outline of the shape."""
"""Next, we will click on Flat color icon. We see a black color outline around the rectangle shape."""
We can increase or decrease the thickness of the outline using the Stroke style tab.
"""Let's keep the width parameter as 10. We can also change the units into percentage, point etc. depending on our requirement."""
I will keep the unit as Pixels.
Let's go back again to the Stroke paint tab. We can change the color of the stroke by moving the sliders under the RGB tab.
"""Observe the color change in the outline, as I do so."""
"""Explore the other Flat color options such as HSL, CMYK, Wheel and CMS on your own."""
"""Now, let me click on the Linear gradient. This gives a gradient outline to the rectangle shape."""
"""The gradients that we used earlier, will appear in the drop-down list here. We can use any of those too."""
Let me give red and blue gradient outline to my rectangle.
"""In a similar way, we can use the remaining stroke icons and give some interesting patterns and gradient outlines to our objects."""
Next we will learn about Stroke style. Click on it.
We already learnt how to modify the width of the stroke.
"""Now, let's look at the 3 Join icons namely, Miter join, Round join and Bevel join. By default, the stroke is in Miter join."""
Let me zoom in to one of the corners of the rectangle for a better view.
"""Now, let's click on the Round join to give a round corner to the stroke. Observe the changes in the edges of the stroke."""
"""Next, we will click on the Bevel join option to create a Bevel corner."""
"""Various dash patterns are available in the Dashes drop-down menu. Using these, we can give different dash patterns to the stroke and vary the width too."""
Next is the Cap option. This basically works on line strokes.
"""Go to Tool box. Click on Freehand tool. So, let us draw a line with the help of Freehand tool."""
"""Now, let us zoom in to the end of the line."""
"""By default, Butt cap is selected and it gives a flat edge to the end."""
"""Now, I will click on the Round cap to give a rounded edge."""
Next is the Square cap which gives a flat and extended edge to the ends of the line.
There are 3 Markers right below the Dashes tab which places markers on the middle of the path.
Click on the drop-down menu of each Marker to see the available lists.
"""Under Start Markers, let me select Torso."""
We will select Curvein as Mid markers.
"""For the End Markers, we will select Legs."""
Observe a cartoon shape is formed on the canvas.
"""Lastly, notice 2 sliders at the bottom of the Fill and stroke dialog box,  namely, Blur and Opacity."""
Let's first select the rectangle again.
The Blur slider is used to give a blur effect to an object. I will click on the slider and move it towards the right.
Observe that the rectangle becomes blurred as I move the slider more and more to the right.
The Opacity slider is used to give transparency to a shape. Move the slider to the right and observe the changes in the shape.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt to:"""
Fill color in objects using the Fill and Stroke options Give strokes or outlines to shapes Various types of Gradients and  Stroke Paint and Stroke Styles.
Here is an assignment for you-
1. Create a pentagon filled with a Linear gradient of red and yellow color with a blue stroke of width 5 pixels.
2. An ellipse filled with Wavy pattern and change the opacity to 70%.
"""3. A line with a width of 10, with Start Markers as Arrow1Lstart and End Markers as Tail."""
Your completed assignment should look like this.

"""Dear Friends, Welcome to the spoken tutorial on “LaTeX on Windows using TeXworks”"""
"""In this tutorial we will learn to,  Download and install MikTeX ."""
Write basic LaTeX documents using TeXworks.
Configure MikTeX to download missing packages.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Windows7 operating system and MikTeX2.9"""
Let us now see the salient features of TeXworks
It is platform independent
It has an embedded pdf reader
It supports Indian language typesetting
"""Before we start with TeXworks, we have to install MikTeX."""
MikTeX is an up-to-date implementation of TeX/LaTeX and related programs for Windows.
"""It contains the necessary packages to create basic documents in LaTeX on Windows ,Moreover, TeXworks is a default editor available with MikTeX installation."""
Go to the website www.miktex.org
Click on the download link for recommended MikTeX installer. This will download the MikTeX installer.
Download and save it on your Desktop..
"""It is a large file, about 154 mega bytes. Hence, it will take some time to download."""
I have already downloaded this file. Here it is.
Double click on this file to start the installation.
Check the check box and click on Next.
Choose all default options.
The installation will take around 5 to 10 minutes.
I have already installed MikTeX on my computer. Hence I will not proceed with the installation.
"""After successfully installing MikTeX on your computer,"""
let us see how to use the TeXworks editor which comes with MikTeX.
Click on the Windows start button.
Click on All Programs.
Click on MikTeX2.9.
Click on TeXworks.
TeXworks editor will open.
Let me open an already existing LaTeX document.
"""I will click on File, then click on Open and choose the directory. Then I will open the file hello.tex."""
You can see that the text written in the file is colored.
This is called syntax highlighting.  It helps the user differentiate between the user content and the LaTeX syntax.
"""In case the LaTeX syntax is not highlighted, do the following."""
"""In the TeXworks window, click on Format button available on the Menu bar."""
Select Syntax Colouring and then click on LaTeX.
"""If you want TeXworks to apply syntax highlighting every time you create a LaTeX document, do the following"""
"""On the menu bar, click on Edit and then click on Preferences."""
"""In the Editor tab, click on the dropdown button which gives options for Syntax Colouring."""
Choose LaTeX and then click on Ok.
"""In this way, syntax highlighting will be applied to all documents created in the future."""
Now we are ready to compile our LaTeX document.
Press Ctrl and t keys together to start the compilation.
"""Once the document is compiled without errors, the resulting pdf will be opened."""
Note that this pdf reader comes along with TeXworks.
It is the default pdf reader used by TeXworks to display the compiled pdf documents.
We have completed the basic installation of LATEX.
This is sufficient for many formatting requirements.
You may now leave this tutorial. Practice the remaining LATEX tutorials on the playlist
"""While practising other tutorials, you may get the following error message:“The required file ABC is missing. It is a part of the following package: XYZ”"""
Here ABC is a file inside the package XYZ
ABC and XYZ will be specific to your case.
"""When you get such an error message, listen to the rest of this tutorial."""
Two ways to solve that problem are explained in the rest of this tutorial. At least one of them should work for you.
Goodbye for now
Do you want to know how to solve a problem of the following type: Listen to the rest of this tutorial and practise with me.
Now let us compile a Beamer document.
Beamer package by default is not included in the MikTeX setup that we have installed.
This means that we have to : download it from some source and add it to our current MikTeX distribution
There are two ways of installing a missing package.
One way is to install it on the fly while we are compiling a LaTeX document
This LaTeX document will typically require a package not available in your MikTeX distribution.
"""Other way, is to manually choose and install a package using Package Manager of MikTeX."""
Let us see the first method.
"""We will  open and compile a LaTeX document, which requires MikTeX  to install packages from the internet."""
First close the TeXworks editor.
It is required that we open the tex file with administrator privileges.
Click on the start button. Then click on All programs. Click on MikTeX2.9
Right click on TeXworks and choose Run as Administrator
This will launch the TeXworks editor with administrator privileges.
Now click on File. Then click on Open  Choose the file beamer.tex
Press Ctrl and t keys together to start the compilation.
A Package Installation dialog box will open.
It will ask to install the missing package beamer.cls.
Click on Change button on this dialog box.
Change Package Repository dialog box will open.
Choose the option Packages shall be installed from the internet.
Click on Connection Settings.
It will prompt you to configure the proxy settings.
If you are not on a proxy network then leave the Use proxy server checkbox unchecked.
"""Since i am on a proxy network, i will enable the option by clicking on the checkbox"""
I will enter the proxy address.
I will enter proxy port number.
I will enable the option Authentication required by clicking on the corresponding checkbox
Click on Ok. And then click on Next
It will ask me the proxy username and password.
I will enter the information and click on OK.
It will show a list of various remote package repositories.
Choose one from the list and click on Finish.
Click on Install.
It will install the beamer.cls package
Once again the Package Installation dialog box will open.
It will prompt to install the missing package pgfcore.sty.
You may uncheck the option Always show this dialog before installing packages.
"""If you do this, MikTeX will not prompt you again, if it encounters a missing package."""
Click on Install.
"""Now if there any more missing packages, it will automatically install it, without asking for your permission."""
"""Once the installation completes, it will finish the compilation and open the pdf output."""
We can see that we have successfully compiled a Beamer document.
Now let us see the second method of installing missing packages.
Click on the Windows start button.
Click on All Programs.
Click on MikTeX2.9
Click on Maintenance (Admin)
Cick on Package Manager (Admin)
It will show a list of various packages available.
Now let us take a look at this list.
There are six columns in this list.
"""These are Name, Category, Size, Packaged date, Installed on date and Title."""
The Installed on column is very important to us.
The packages for which this column is blank indicates that these packages are not installed.
Let us see how to install a particular package.
"""Let me choose the package abc, for example."""
"""Notice that the moment I choose the package, the plus button on the top left side gets enabled."""
The plus button is the install button. Click on the plus button.
A window will open which will list the number of packages you have chosen to install or uninstall.
Click on Proceed.
"""Since I have configured a proxy network connection, it will prompt me for the proxy username and password."""
Let me type my username and password
Click on Ok
A window will open which will show the download progress of the package selected for installation.
It may happen that it fails to download the requested package due to remote server connectivity issues.
"""In that case, change the package repository and try again."""
We can see that the installation of selected package is completed.
Click on Close.
The package list will get refreshed.
Notice that 11 september 2013 appears in the Installed on column for package abc.
This completes the tutorial LaTeX on Windows using TeXworks
In this tutorial we learnt to -  Download and install MikTeX.
Write a basic LaTeX document using TeXworks
Configure MikTeX to download missing packages in 2 different ways

"""Welcome to Meet the GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I’m recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""In the previous edition I got this image here, after editing."""
"""And today, I think I should do something to set the colors"""
because this image is too green.
There are lot of ways to adjust the color and one of them is the Curves tool.
I click on the Curves tool in tool box and then I select the Green Channel and pull the curve down.
Now you can see that the colour channels and the fog in the image looks like the real fog.
"""Now, I have to adjust the curve in such a way that I get an image which is gray and not green or magenta."""
I don’t want to use Curves tool because it damages the details of the image and I can’t correct the damage afterwards.
I could use the Undo tool but I will have to redo all the steps after that.
"""So, I want to have something that will not damage the image and I can adjust later on."""
There is such a way which uses a simple filter with layers.
"""So, I have opened here the layer dialog."""
You will see here background which is our original image.
"""And I simply add a new layer and I select White in Layer Fill Type and give it a name, color correction green."""
Now my image is fully white but I can change the layer mode.
The 'layer mode' is an algorithm which combines the two layers i.e the original Background layer and the newly created layer.
"""So, I choose here the Multiply mode."""
"""And you get the original image back, as it was before."""
"""The Multiply mode, multiplies the pixels from the background to the pixels from the foreground and divides the result by 255."""
"""And in a white picture, all the color channels are 255; so multiplying by 255 and dividing by 255 gives the starting point i.e. Background."""
"""But if I reduce one channel in the new layer, it will be reduced in the background also because multiplying by say 200 and dividing by 255 gives less."""
Now I want to select such a color which has a reduced green channel.
"""Here I have black as foreground colour which I change to background colour and white as foreground colour and you can see that red, green & blue all colour channels have same value i.e 255."""
"""By the way, don’t be distracted by the colours on the slider here."""
"""This is not blue, this is yellow but when I slide this down to a certain point, you see that colours in all the sliders change automatically."""
"""Ok, I select the green slider here and pull the slider to say something around 211."""
And I pull the colour which I got as my foreground colour into my image and I get the result which is way to magenta.
But I can adjust the intensity of my green reduction with the help of the opacity slider.
"""And when I go back to zero, I get the old image and when I pull the slider up I can reduce the green channel in the image and also avoid getting magenta into the image."""
I think this looks quite good.
"""By using the Layers tool, I can do changes anytime I want to and also I can do fine adjustments when more layers are stacked onto it and the change will stay even if I change something in underlying picture."
There are still changes to be made in this layer as now it appears gray and I want to add a bit of blue.
Again I follow the same procedure and make a new layer and called it color correction blue.
And now I want to add a little bit of blue.
"""For adding blue in the image, I use the Screen Mode which is  little bit more complicated than Multiply mode."""
"""In Screen mode, the colors are first inverted and then multiplied and divided and quite complicated."""
Let me change the foreground colour to black and add the colour  I want to add directly and now I have to add a little bit of blue.
"""So, slide down the blue slider a bit."""
And drag the colour into the image.
"""This, here, is supposed to be blue which looks still like black but it is very dark blue."""
"""Look at the image here and when I switch this off, you see the change."""
The image is definitely bluish.
I can switch off both the new layers and by that you get the starting point.
"""When I click on the first layer, we see the reduced channel of green and when I click on 2nd layer it adds a bit blue colour."""
I think this is too much blue so I reduce the opacity.
I think this looks good.
"""I can adjust it later on, all the time."""
The Layers tool is very powerful because you can create layer upon layers and in each layer you can change the pixels which are coming up from the lower layer.
Possibilities of doing the correction is limitless and you can do it whenever you want.
Perhaps here you can slide the opacity slider a bit down to get a good colour and you can play with these sliders which give real hand full of possibilities to change the color here.
I think I have to cover the Layers tool in detail on a special show but for today this is enough.
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project and I hope to see you around next time."""
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on BOSS Desktop.
"""In this tutorial, we will get familiar with the BOSS Desktop environment."""
"""Here, I am using BOSS Linux 3.4.2 with wide Indian language support & packages."""
Let me minimize the slide.
"""What you are seeing here, is the BOSS Desktop."""
You can see the main menu on the top left hand side corner.
"""To open this menu, press Alt+F1 keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""Alternately, click on Applications menu."""
The 'Applications menu' contains all the installed applications in a categorized manner.
"""In this Applications menu, let us get familiar with some important applications."""
"""So, let's go to Applications, Accessories, Calculator."""
"""Calculator helps perform arithmetic, scientific or financial calculations."""
Let's open the calculator by clicking on it.
Let us try some simple calculations.
Type 5*(into)8 and press '='(equals to) sign.
"""Instead of pressing '='(equals to) sign, you can also press the Enter key."""
"""Now, exit this calculator by pressing the close button."""
"""Now, let's look at another application."""
"""For that, go back to Applications, then go to Accessories."""
"""In Accessories, let's open gedit Text Editor by clicking on it."""
"""So, what you see right now on screen is the gedit Text Editor."""
Let me type some text here and save it.
Type: Hello World.
"""To save the file, I can press Crtl+S keys or go to File and then click on Save."""
"""So, let me go to File and then click on Save."""
The Save As dialog box opens up.
It prompts for filename and location in which the file has to be saved.
"""So, let me type the name as hello.txt and for location, I will select the Desktop."""
Click on Save button.
Let's close this gedit window now and check whether our file is saved on the Desktop or not.
"""Now come to the Desktop and you can see the file """"hello.txt"""" here."""
"""So, our text file has got saved successfully."""
Let me open this file by double-clicking on it.
"""Here is our text, """"Hello World""""."""
"""We can type in multiple local languages too, in the 'gedit Text Editor'."""
Let us see how to do so.
"""In gedit Text Editor, press CTRL + SPACE BAR."""
You can see a small box at the bottom right hand side.
Click on it.
Select 'Hindi'.
Inscript.
I will type hello world.
You can see the text has changed to Hindi Inscript.
"""Now I will select Hindi,  then I will select Phonetic."""
I will type welcome using phonetics.
And you can see the word welcome typed in Hindi.
"""Now, click on Save to save the changes."""
Let's close this text editor and let's see another important application from Accessories i.e Terminal.
"""So, let's move back to Applications, Accessories and then Terminal."""
"""Terminal is called command line because you can command the computer from here.In fact, it is more powerful than the GUI."""
Now let's type a simple command to get a feel of  Terminal.
"""So, let's type """"ls"""" and press Enter."""
You can see it lists all the files and folders in the current working directory.
Here it is displaying files and folders from the Home folder.
We will see later in this tutorial what the Home folder is.
Terminal commands are explained well in the subsequent Linux spoken tutorials in this series.
Let us close the Terminal now.
Now let's move on to another application i.e Iceweasel Web Browser.
This is the default web-browser on the BOSS Operating System.
Click on Applications >> Internet >> Iceweasel Web Browser.
Iceweasel is the re-branded version of Firefox.
"""Using this browser, you can access your emails or search for some information on the net."""
Let's go to the google-site.
"The short-cut key to go to the address bar is F6 or you can click here, on the address bar."""
I will type www.google.co.in.
"""As I type, Iceweasel may suggest a few possibilities."""
You may choose one of these or continue to type the complete address and press Enter.
We are now in the google search page.  Let us type spoken tutorial in the search bar.
The spoken tutorial website is listed as the first option.  Let's click on it.
This will open the spoken tutorial Home page.
Let's close this and move on.
"""Now, let's click on Applications and then on Office."""
"""In this Office menu, we have LibreOffice options like Writer, Calc and Impress."""
"""These are the word processor, spreadsheet and presentation components of LibreOffice Suite."""
The Spoken Tutorial website has spoken tutorials on these topics.  We suggest that you explore them.
"""Next, under Applications, let's explore Sound &Video menu."""
This option lists the various player options available in BOSS OS.
You can use any of these options to play your video or audio files.
"""Now, let's see some other important things. Let's go to Places menu this time."""
The first option here is the 'Home' folder.
Let's open it.
Every user has a unique Home folder in BOSS OS.
We can say that the Home folder is our house where we can store our files and folders.
"""Unless we permit, others cannot see them."""
"""More information on file permissions is available in the 'Linux spoken tutorials', available on the spoken tutorial website."""
"""In our Home folder, we can see other folders such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music etc."""
"""In Linux, everything is a file."""
Let's open the Desktop folder by double-clicking on it.
"""Hey, we can see that the same hello.txt file what we saved from gedit text editor is here."""
"""So, this folder and the Desktop are the same."""
Let me close this folder now.
Let's learn to change the Desktop theme now.
Go to the right hand side corner and click on the username displayed there.
"""In my case, the username is spoken.  So, I will click on spoken."""
"""Now, click on System Settings option."""
The System Settings dialog box opens up.
Click on Background icon.
Choose any background from the list displayed.
It will appear as your new background.
Close this dialog box.
"""Now, we will come to the System Tools option available under 'Applications' menu."""
This menu has many important options which helps you to manage your desktop and the various applications.
Click on System tools >> Administration and Synaptic Package Manager.
It will immediately prompt you for the 'admin password' for authentication.
Type in your 'admin' password and click on Authenticate button.
Details on how to use Synaptic Package Manager is available in a separate tutorial in this series.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

Hello everyone.
Welcome to the tutorial on  'Connecting to a MySQL Database'.
"""In this tutorial, we will look at:"""
Configuring MySQL server properties
Starting the MySQL server
Creating and connecting to the database
Creating database tables under which we will explore two methods:
using the sql editor
"""using the create table dialog and finally,"""
Running an SQL script.
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System Ubuntu version 12.04"""
and  Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
You also need the  Java Development Kit (JDK) version 6
and  MySQL database server.
"""To learn this tutorial, basic understanding of database management is necessary."""
"""To know more, watch  PHP and MySQL spoken tutorials on the link shown."""
Other standard programming terminologies have been used in this tutorial.
This tutorial demonstrates how to setup a connection to a MySQL database from the Netbeans IDE.
"""Once connected, we will work with MySQL in the IDE's Database  Explorer."""
Let us switch to the IDE now.
Netbeans IDE comes bundled with support for the MySQL RDBMS.
"""Before you access  MySQL database server in Netbeans, you must configure the MySQL server properties."""
Right-click the Databases node in the Services window.
Choose  Register MySQL Server to open the MySQL server properties dialog-box.
Confirm that the Server Host Name and the Port are correct.
"""Notice that the IDE enters """"localhost"""" as the default server host name."""
3306 is the default server port Number.
"""Enter the Administrator Username, if not displayed."""
"""On my system, the Administrator Username is """"root""""."""
Enter the Administrator password.
"""On my system, the password is blank."""
Click the  Admin Properties tab at the top of the dialog-box.
This allows you to enter information for controlling the MySQL server.
"""In the  Path/URL to admin tool: field,"""
type or browse to the location of your  'MySQL Administration' application.
"""On my system, the location to the tool is  /usr/bin/mysqladmin."""
Type any arguments for the admin tool in the Arguments field.
This can also be left blank.
"""In the Path to start command: field,"""
type or browse to the location of the  MySQL start command.
On my system it is: /usr/bin/mysqld_safe.
Type any arguments for the start command in the Arguments field.
"""Here, I will type:  -u space root space  start."""
"""In the Path to stop command:,"""
type or browse to the location of the MySQL stop command.
This is usually the path to the mysqladmin' in the bin folder of the MySQL installation directory.
"""On my system, this is: /usr/bin/mysqladmin."""
"""If the command is mysqladmin, in the Arguments field, type: -u space root space stop."""
"""When finished, the Admin Properties tab should resemble what is shown on the screen."""
Click OK.
First ensure that the MySQL database server is running on your machine.
"""The MySQL server node in the Service window, indicates whether the MySQL database server is connected."""
"""After making sure that it is running, right-click the Databases >> MySQL server node and choose Connect."""
"""When expanded, the MySQL server node displays all the available MySQL databases."""
A common way of interacting with databases is through an SQL Editor.
Netbeans has a built-in SQL Editor for this purpose.
You can access this by right-clicking on the connection node.
Let us now create a new database instance using the SQL Editor.
"""In the Services window, right-click the MySQL server node and choose Create Database."""
"""In the Create Database dialog, type the name of the new database."""
"""I will name this """"mynewdatabase""""."""
You can also grant full access to a given user.
"""By default, only the admin user has the permissions to perform certain commands."""
The drop-down list allows you to assign these permissions to a specified user.
"""It is a good practice to grant users most permissions, except to drop tables"""
and allow users to modify only those databases that are created by their application.
"""But for now, we will leave the check-box unselected."""
"""Let us now create tables, populate them with data and modify the data maintained in tables."""
"""""""mynewdatabase"""" is currently empty."""
Let us explore the first method to input data in the tables.
"""In the Database explorer, expand the mynewdatabase connection node."""
There are three sub folders:
"""Tables, Views  and Procedures."""
Right-click the Tables folder and choose Execute Command.
"""A blank canvas opens in the  SQL Editor, in the main window."""
Let us type a simple query in this  SQL editor.
I have now typed a simple query in the SQL editor.
"""This is a table definition for the  Counselor table, we are about to create."""
"""To execute this query, either right-click the Run SQL icon in the task bar at the top"""
or right-click within the SQL Editor and choose Run Statement.
The IDE generates the Counselor table in the database.
You can see this message in the Output window
which says that the command was executed successfully.
"""To verify these changes, right-click the Tables node in the Database Explorer."""
Choose Refresh.
This updates the current status of the specified database.
The new Counselor table now displays under the Tables option.
"""If you expand the Table node, you can see the columns that you created."""
"""Let us now explore the next method to input data in the tables,"""
i.e. using the Create Table Dialog.
"""In the Database Explorer, right-click the Tables node and choose Create Table."""
The Create Table dialog opens.
"""In the Table name text field, type """"Subject""""."""
Click on Add Column .
"""In the Add Column dialog, type """"id"""" in the Name field."""
Choose SMALLINT for data-type from the Type drop-down menu.
Select the Primary Key check-box in the Add Column dialog-box.
This is to specify the primary-key for your table.
"""Note that when you select the Primary Key check-box, the Index and Unique check-boxes are automatically selected;"""
also the Null check-box is deselected.
This is because primary-keys are used to identify an unique row in the database.
Click OK.
"""Repeat this procedure to add the remaining columns, as shown on the screen."""
"""We have now created a table named Subject that will hold data for Name, Description and Counselor ID."""
"""By running SQL queries on a database, we can add, modify and delete data maintained in database structures."""
Let us add a new record to the Counselor table.
Choose Execute Command from the Tables node context menu.
A new SQL Editor opens in the main window.
"""In the SQL Editor, let us type a simple query."""
"""To execute this query, right-click within the source editor and choose Run Statement."""
Let us now verify if the new record has been added to the table.
Right-click the Counselor table and choose View Data.
A query to select all data from the table is automatically generated.
The results of this statement are displayed in a table view below the workspace.
Note that a new row has been added with the data we just supplied.
We can also run an external SQL script directly in the IDE.
I have a SQL query here for demonstrative purposes.
This script creates two tables similar to the ones we have just created.
i.e. Counselor and Subject.
"""Because the script overwrites these tables,"""
we will delete these two tables if they already exist.
"""To delete tables, right-click on the Counselor table"""
and choose Delete.
Click Yes in the Confirm Object Deletion dialog-box.
Repeat the same for the Subject table.
"""Now, open the existing SQL query file from your system."""
"""From the File menu, choose Open File."""
Browse to the location containing this file.
The script automatically opens in the SQL editor.
Make sure the connection to mynewdatabase is selected.
"""Check this from the C onnection drop-down in the toolbar, at the top of the editor."""
Click the Run SQL  button in the task bar.
And the script is executed against the selected database.
Right-click the mynewdatabase connection node and choose Refresh.
This updates the database component to the current status of the specified database.
Right-click on any of these tables now and choose View Data.
"""And, below the workspace, you can see the data contained in the new tables."""
"""In this tutorial, you learnt to-"""
configure MySQL on your computer
set up a connection to the database server from the IDE
"""create, delete, modify data and"""
run SQL queries.
"""As an assignment,create another database instance with tables."""
Populate these tables with necessary data to maintain your personal book library.
"""And, run these SQL statements to view data."""
I have created a similar database which maintains details of my personal movie library.
Your assignment should resemble this.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installing Moodle on Local Server.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to download Moodle and install Moodle."""
"""To install Moodle, you should have a system supporting: Apache 2.x (or higher version),"""
MariaDB 5.5.30 (or any higher version) and  PHP 5.4.4 +(or any higher version).
"""To record this tutorial, I will be using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04,"""
"""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30"""
Moodle 3.3 and Firefox web browser.
You can use any web browser of your choice.
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
Please ensure that you have internet connectivity before you begin.
"""Also refer to the previous tutorials in this series. And, ensure that the prerequisites are met and the database is setup properly."""
We should have XAMPP running and We should have a database set up with username moodle-st.
"""First, let me go to the web browser and launch XAMPP."""
"""In the address bar, type: http colon double slash 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1  and press Enter."""
"""In the menu at the top right of the screen, click on PHPinfo."""
"""Now, press Ctrl + F keys and search for DOCUMENT underscore ROOT."""
It will be found in the table Apache Environment.
The value of DOCUMENT underscore ROOT will be either  slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs or slash var slash www
"""In my machine, it is slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs."""
Please make a note of this path. We are going to install Moodle here.
Let’s now start downloading Moodle. Go to the official website of Moodle which is moodle.org.
"""Click on the Downloads link in the top menu. And then, click on the latest release button MOODLE 3.3+."""
"""At the time of recording this tutorial, the latest stable Moodle version is 3.3. It could be different when you try."""
Click on the Download zip button. This will start downloading Moodle on our machine.
I have already downloaded this file and it is in my Downloads folder. So I will skip this step.
Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T keys together.
"""On the terminal, I will change the directory to Downloads."""
"""To do that, type the command: cd space Downloads and press Enter."""
You will have to type the path where you downloaded Moodle on your system.
"""Once you are in that directory, type ls and press Enter to list the files therein."""
Here is my Moodle installation file.  It has the name moodle hyphen latest hyphen 33 dot zip.
"""If you had renamed it to some other name during download, then locate that file in your folder."""
"""Next, we have to extract the contents of this zip file into the moodle folder."""
"""At the command prompt, type: sudo space unzip space moodle hyphen latest hyphen 33 dot zip space hyphen d space slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs slash. Now press Enter."""
Let’s clear the terminal by pressing Ctrl + L.
Now type: cd space slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs and press Enter.
"""To list the files in this directory, type ls and press Enter."""
You can see that a new folder named moodle has been created.
"""Let us give read, write and execute permissions to the owner and the group members of moodle folder."""
"""So, type: sudo space chmod space 777 space moodle slash and press Enter."""
"""Enter the administrative password, if prompted, and press Enter."""
Now switch to the browser and type: http colon double slash 127.0.0.1 slash moodle  or http colon double slash localhost slash moodle.
I have typed my localhost IP here.
This IP necessarily has to be the IP of the machine on which moodle is installed. Please note that moodle is the folder into which we had extracted earlier.
Press Enter and you will see the Moodle installation page.
"""By default, we are in step number one, that is, Configuration. Please note: Moodle can be installed in multiple languages."""
"""But we will limit ourselves to English language only. So, select English here. Click on Next button below the Language dropdown."""
"""Next is the Paths page. This is where the Web address, Moodle directory and Data directory are defined."""
Web address is the URL for us to access Moodle once installed.
This is the same URL that we entered above which is shown here.
Moodle directory is the folder where all the Moodle code is available.
"""Notice here, both Web address and Moodle directory are non-editable fields. These cannot be changed by us."""
Next is the Data directory. This is the folder where all file content uploaded by teachers and students will be stored.
"""This folder needs to have read and write permission. So, the files can be stored here."""
"""However, it should not be directly accessible on the web for security reasons."""
"""So, it is to be kept outside of the installation folder."""
moodledata inside the folder lampp is the default data directory which the installer tries to create.
"""However, it does not have the permission to create a folder here. So, we have to create this folder manually and give it the required permissions."""
"""Go to the terminal window. At the prompt, type: sudo space mkdir space slash opt slash lampp slash moodledata and press Enter."""
"""Now, type: sudo space chmod space 777 space slash opt slash lampp slash moodledata and press Enter."""
Go back to the browser now and click on Next button.
After this comes the database configuration page. Select MariaDB from the dropdown and click on the Next button.
Enter localhost as the  Database Host Name.
"""Now, we have to enter the database name, username and password. These are the ones we created earlier in phpMyAdmin."""
I will enter moodle-st as the database name.
Then moodle-st as the database username.
"""And, moodle-st as my database password."""
Leave the Table Prefix and the other fields as they are and click on Next.
We can see a terms and conditions page.
This is the step where you need to read the license agreement and agree to the same. Read the text and then click on Continue.
We can see the Server Checks page next. Scroll down to see the message Your server environment meets all minimum requirements.
You may get other errors as shown: Refer to the Additional reading material link of this tutorial for the solution.
Click on Continue.
"""This step may take some time depending on your internet speed. You may get an error message Site is being upgraded, please retry later if you refresh the page."""
"""In that case, please refresh after some time."""
Click Continue when you get a success message for the installation.
The next page is for administrator configuration.
Enter the username that you want for the Moodle Administrative page. I will enter the username as admin.
Now enter a password for the Moodle Administrator. The password here must follow these rules as shown here.
"""To enter the password, click on Click to enter text link."""
I will enter Spokentutorial1@ as my admin password. Click on Unmask icon to reveal the password.
Note down the username and password that you have created for future use.
Email address is a mandatory field. I will enter priyankaspokentutorial@gmail.com here.
"""In Select a country drop-down, select India. Select the timezone as Asia/Kolkata."""
We will leave rest of the fields with their default values.
Scroll down and click on Update Profile button.
Please note that Moodle is a resource consuming software. Every step may take time to complete.
Please wait for the next page to load and do not close or refresh the page.
The next screen is for Front page settings. This is the page people will see when they visit our moodle site.
Enter Digital India LMS as the Full Site Name.
Enter Digital India LMS again as the Short name for site.  This is what will be visible as the name of the moodle site in the navigation bar.
"""Let us leave the Front Page Summary as blank, for now. Select the timezone as Asia/Kolkata."""
"""The next dropdown is Self Registration. If Self Registration is enabled, then new users can register themselves on their own."""
Select Disable from the dropdown. Next is the text box no-reply address.
"""The default value in this field is noreply@localhost.  Since this is not a valid email ID, change it to noreply@localhost.com."""
"""This email ID will be shown as From address, when Moodle does not have any email ID to show."""
"""For example. If I specify to keep my address as private, all mails sent on my behalf will have this email ID.  Lastly, click on Save Changes button."""
We are now ready to use Moodle.  You can see the front page of the new site here.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial.  Let us summarize."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to: download Moodle from moodle.org and  install Moodle on local server."""

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on Ubuntu Linux Desktop 16.04.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about  Ubuntu Linux Desktop  on the gnome environment"""
and some common applications on the Ubuntu Desktop.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 O S."""
The Ubuntu desktop looks like this.
You'll see the launcher on the left hand side of the screen.
How can we hide the launcher?
"""To do so, go to the launcher on the left side. Click on the System Settings icon."""
"""In the System Settings window, click on Appearance."""
"""In the Appearance window, click on the Behavior tab."""
"""Here, switch Auto-hide the Launcher to ON position."""
Now the launcher will be hidden.
"""If the launcher is hidden, as shown here, then we can make it visible again."""
"""To do so, move the cursor to the extreme left of the screen."""
The launcher will become visible.
Move the cursor away and the launcher will get hidden again.
Switch back to the Appearance window and turn Auto-hide the Launcher to OFF position.
Close this window by clicking on the tiny X icon at the top left of the window.
"""Notice, there are some icons on the launcher, by default."""
"""At the top of the launcher, you can see the Dash home icon."""
"""Dash home is an interface which gives access to all  applications in  Ubuntu Linux,   within a screen."""
"""To open Dash home, click on it."""
"""Prominently at the top, you'll see the search bar  field."""
"""Now, how do we locate a particular application? Just type in the name of the application you are looking for and you will find it instantly. It's that simple!"""
Let’s try to locate the Calculator application.
"""So, in the search bar field, type C a l c."""
"""All the applications that have c a l c in their name, will be listed."""
Observe here - both LibreOffice Calc and Calculator are listed.
Click on the Calculator icon. The Calculator application now opens on the screen.
"""Calculator  helps perform arithmetic, scientific or financial calculations."""
Let us try some simple calculation.
Type 5 asterisk 8 and click on the equal to (=) sign.
"""Instead of clicking on the equal to sign, you can also press the Enter  key on the keyboard."""
The answer is displayed on the Calculator.
"""Likewise, we can do all sort of calculations using the Calculator application."""
"""Now, exit this Calculator  by clicking on this tiny  X icon at the top left of the window."""
Let’s get familiar with some other important applications in Ubuntu Linux OS.
"""For that, we will go back to Dash home."""
"""In the Search bar, let’s type gedit. gedit is the default Text Editor in the Ubuntu Linux OS."""
The Text Editor icon appears below. Let’s click on it to open it.
"""What you see right now on the screen, is the gedit Text Editor  window."""
"""Let me type some text here. For example, type: """"Hello World""""."""
"""To save the file, press Ctrl and S keys simultaneously on the keyboard."""
"""Alternately, we can click on File and then on Save."""
"""Now, a dialog box named “Save as” opens up. It asks for a filename  and the location where the file has to be saved."""
"""So, let’s type the name as """"Hello.txt""""."""
.txt is the default extension of a text file.
"""And for location, let’s select Desktop. And, click on the Save  button at the bottom."""
Let's close this gedit window now by clicking on the tiny X icon at the top left of the window.
"""On the Desktop, we can see the file Hello.txt. This means our text file  was saved successfully."""
Let me open this file  by double-clicking on it.
"""See, our text file has opened with our written text."""
The internet  has a lot of information on gedit Text Editor.
"""There are some spoken tutorials available on this topic also, on this website."""
Let's close this text editor  and look at another application  i.e the Terminal.
"""So, let's go to Dash home once again. Now type the word terminal  in the search bar field."""
Click on the Terminal icon that appears below.
The terminal window opens on the screen. Please note: The shortcut to open the Terminal is Ctrl+Alt+T keys.
The terminal is also called the command line. This is because you can command the computer from here.
"""In fact, it is more powerful than the GUI."""
Let me switch back to the Terminal window.
Now let ’s type a simple command  to get a feel of the terminal. Type 'ls'  and press Enter.
You can see a list  of all the files  and folders  in the current directory.
"""Here, it is displaying files and folders from the Home folder."""
"""We will see later in this tutorial, what the Home folder is."""
We will not spend any more time with the terminal now.
Close the terminal by clicking on the tiny X icon at the top left of the window.
Terminal  commands are explained well in the Linux  spoken-tutorial series on this website.
"""Now, let's move on to another application  i.e Firefox Web Browser."""
"""Once again, open Dash home. Type Firefox  in the search bar."""
Click on the Firefox Web Browser  icon.
Firefox Web Browser  is used to access the world wide web. Now we can see that Firefox browser window is open.
"""Let ’s go to the spoken tutorial website. For that, click on the address bar  or press F6  on the keyboard."""
"""Now let’s type """"spoken-tutorial.org"""" and press Enter."""
"""If you have Internet connectivity, then Firefox will connect to the given website."""
The Spoken Tutorial Homepage  opens on the browser.
Let's close this as explained earlier and move on to the next application.
"""So, let's go to Dash home  once again and type office  in the search bar."""
"""You'll see various LibreOffice  components like Calc, Impress, Writer and Draw."""
LibreOffice is the default office application in Ubuntu Linux OS.
Excellent tutorials for all these components are available on the Spoken Tutorial website.
Now let's explore the Video  option.
Type video  in the search bar.
"""In the displayed list, we have one application  named Videos."""
"""Videos is used to play videos and songs. By default, it plays open format  video files only."""
"""So, let me play a sample file from my pen-drive."""
"""Now, I am inserting my pen-drive  in a usb slot  on my machine. The pen-drive folder  has opened  automatically."""
"""If it does not open, we can access it from the launcher."""
Locate the pen-drive icon  on the launcher.
"""If we click on it, it shows the files  and folders  available on the pen-drive."""
Now I will select the movie file big buck bunny.ogv to play.
"""Here is my file. I will double-click on it, to open."""
"""It opens in Videos, by default."""
Let's stop playing the movie.
"""Let us now press Ctrl, Windows and D keys to go to the Desktop."""
Now let's see some other important things on this Desktop.
Notice the folder icon  present in the launcher. Let's click on it.
The Home folder opens.
Every user has a unique Home folder in Ubuntu Linux.
"""We can say that the Home folder  is our house where we can store our files  and folders. Unless we permit, others cannot see them."""
More information on file permissions  is available in the Linux  spoken-tutorial series.
"""Let’s switch back. In our Home folder, we can see other folders such as- Desktop, Documents, Downloads,  etc."""
"""In Linux, everything is a file. Let ’s open the Desktop folder  by double -clicking on it."""
"""Here, we can see that the same """"hello.txt""""  file that we saved from the text editor."""
"""So, this folder  and the Desktop  are the same."""
Let me close this folder now. That’s all for this tutorial. Let us summarise.
"""In this tutorial we learnt about- the Ubuntu Desktop, the launcher and some of the icons  available on it,"""
"""few common applications like- Calculator, Text Editor, Terminal, Firefox Web Browser, Videos and LibreOffice Suite components  and the Home folder."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on the Mozilla Firefox Interface and Toolbars.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the Firefox interface and the toolbars."""
"""In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 for Ubuntu 10.04."""
Let’s now take a look at the Firefox interface.
Firefox has all the features that a modern browser needs to have.
"""To learn how to use Mozilla Firefox effectively, one should be familiar with each of its features."""
"""The Mozilla Firefox interface can be split up into 6 distinct areas, namely-"""
"""The Menu bar, the Navigation toolbar, the Bookmarks bar, the Side bar, the Status bar, and the Content area."""
Let’s look at each of these and learn what it does.
Let's click on the File menu and click on New Window.
A new window pops up.
Some people have trouble looking at small script in their browser.
"""So, let's zoom into the page by clicking on View > Zoom and Zoom In."""
"""Alternately, you can press Ctrl + +."""
This will make the text bigger.
"""To know which version of Mozilla Firefox you are using, click on Help and About Firefox."""
"""By default, Firefox displays a Homepage."""
"""But, to set your own preferred webpage as Homepage, click on Edit and Preferences."""
Windows users please click on Tools and Options.
"""In the General tab, click on Home Page field and type: ‘www.yahoo.com’ or any of your preferred webpage."""
Now you can close Firefox Preferences window by clicking the Close button on the bottom right hand corner.
You can use the Edit menu to search for particular words within the webpage.
"""In the address bar, type: ‘www.google.com’"""
Click on Edit and Find.
A small toolbar appears at the bottom of the browser window.
"""In the textbox, type the word ‘Gujarati’."""
You will observe that the word ‘Gujarati’ on the page gets highlighted.
This function is very useful when searching through large text on a webpage.
Let's close this.
"""As the name suggests, the Navigation toolbar helps you navigate through the internet."""
The Navigation bar is the large text box where you type the address of the webpage that you want to visit.
It is called the URL bar or Address bar.
Click on the URL and delete the address that is already there.
"""Now, type: ‘www.google.com’."""
Press the Enter key.You will now be in the Google Homepage.
Clicking on the 'back-arrow' icon will take you back to the page where you were before.
Click on the forward arrow to go back to the Google homepage.
"""To the right of the URL bar, is an icon shaped like a house."""
This button takes you back to the default home page from whichever webpage you are on.
This function is useful when you are browsing from a particular site or a search engine.
Let's click on the homepage button.
"""Remember, we changed the 'home page' to ‘www.yahoo.com’ earlier on."""
"""As a result, clicking on the homepage button brings us to the """"yahoo"""" homepage."""
Now let's look at the Bookmarks bar.
'Bookmarks' help you navigate to pages that you visit or refer to often.
"""In the URL bar, type: ‘www.gmail.com’."""
"""Once the page loads, click on the star symbol to the right of the URL bar."""
You see that the star turns yellow.
Click on the star again.A dialog box pops up.
"""From the ‘Folder’ drop down menu, choose 'Bookmarks toolbar'."""
Observe that the 'Gmail' bookmark is now added to the Bookmarks toolbar.
"""Click on the Homepage icon to go to the """"yahoo"""" homepage."""
Click on the 'Gmail'  bookmark.  This will direct you to the Gmail  login page.
You can use the bookmarks bar for sites which you visit often but don’t want to have as your homepage.
Next we will look at the Sidebar.
Click on View and Sidebar and then click on History.
"""You see that the bar on the left side now has 3 options - Today, Yesterday and Older than 6 months."""
The displayed option is subject to the intervals between the usage of Firefox on that computer.
"""Click on the plus sign, next to the Today icon, to expand the menu."""
"""Choose the """"google"""" link to be directed back to the google homepage."""
See how easy it is to go back to the site that you visited before!
The Sidebar even has a Search function of its own.
"""You can type in the name of the site that you want to search for, in the search box."""
This will then search through your history to find it.
"""In the search box, type: """"google""""."""
"""The """"google"""" homepage comes up as the first result."""
You can make the Sidebar disappear by clicking the small ‘x’ on the top right hand corner of the side bar.
"""Next, let's see what the Status bar does."""
The Status bar is the area at the bottom of your browser window that shows you the status of the site you are loading.
Go to the URL bar and type: ‘www.wired.com’ and press Enter key.
Look at the Status bar quickly. It shows you the status of the loading of that  webpage.
"""The Status bar can help you to understand why a particular site is not loading, the time it may take to load etc."""
"""Finally, let's look at the Content area."""
This is where you see the contents of the webpage you are viewing.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: the Firefox interface, the toolbars."""
Try this comprehension assignment..
Change your home page to ‘www.spoken-tutorial.org’  and navigate to it.
Then go to the ‘yahoo’ website by using the browser’s History function.

Today we'll talk about simple animation.
"""The package of GIMP animation is called GAP or GIMP Animation Package which can do a lot about Animations, Films and Movies."""
But we'll cover that later.
The oldest animations in Germany are called Daumenkino or Front Cinema.
And in English it's called Flip Book or Flick Book.
"""This book contains a lot of images which are nearly the same but slide modifications from page to page and if you flick through them, you get  little moving picture."""
"""This video here, is an animation too and you are looking at a slide show with 25 images per second."""
"""Here are two advertise, this is mine and this one from Rob which show animated gif."""
I want to improve my advertisement here.
I want to show in my advertisement the Meet The GIMP logo.
"""Now, I have to save this image to my desktop and I have to successfully create an animation."""
"""So, now I steal my own image and save it on my desktop."""
I open this image with the GIMP.
Just pull it over to the tool box and here it is.
Let me enlarge this a bit here.
Basically there is no animation in this image but there is a stack of eight layers in the layer dialog.
And on the top you can see that this is a gif image which is indexed and has eight layers of 80 by 80 pixels.
This image is made out of 256 different colours.
And to look at these colours go to Dialogs and Colormap.
Here you can see the colours which are used in this image and there is lot of blue and some other colours and each colour has an index and the HTML notation.
"""So, 'gif' images are indexed and not 'rgb' images and so they have only one limited colour available."""
Now let's look at the frames here.
You can see that the 1st layer is named as Background and in bracket it is in milliseconds i.e 5 Seconds.
"""So, this image is shown for 5 seconds and then follows the frames 2,3,4 with 100 milliseconds and there is an option of replace."""
"""To see the frames, I just press the Shift key and hold and click on the eye here and all the other frames are made invisible."""
"""And now I can stack them on the top, here."""
There is a draw back of using the index colours.
You can see lot of spots in here because these tile has only 256 different colours available.
"""So, this here is my background image."""
And this is the other one and also the other image I used in this animation and this drawing was  made by the people instead of following the lesson and I have used it with his permission.
And the rest of the images are simply mixtures of the other images to get a smooth way from one to the other.
"""To recreate this animation, I have to take two images out of this stack which is very easy."""
Just click on the thumbnail here and hold the mouse button and draw it up to the toolbox.
And here is my first image.
Now click here and this one here is my second image.
"""So, I have these two images here and I can close my original animation and I don’t want to save anything of it."""
Now I wanted to include the Meet the GIMP logo.
Just pull it over to the tool box and here it is.
I have to rescale it down to 80 by 80 pixels and then I have to include white colour as my background because black would be too harsh with this image.
"""And to do that, I just add a new layer, fill it with  white and pull it down and now I have white as my background."""
Right click into the layer dialog  and select Flatten image.
Now I have a flat Meet The GIMP  logo on white.
"""Now, go to Image, Scale Image  and I want to have 80 pixels and in Interpolation, Cubic  is good. Click on  Scale."""
And now the image is rescaled but it is way too soft.
"""After rescaling, you have to sharpen it."""
"""So, I go to Filters >> Enhance  >> Sharpen."""
"""I think, I should go fairly high with the sharpness."""
I think this is good.
Now I have three images waiting for becoming one animation.
One thing I have nearly forgotten is saving these basic images.
"""The 1st one is this here, Meet The GIMP and I Save it as """"mtg80.xcf""""."""
And this one here too.
"""Other way to access  menu is, right click into the image and go to Image >> Mode and RGB."""
Then go to File and Save As.
I will use this image as my base.
"""So, I save it again and this time as the copy."""
"""And I call it """"avatar.xcf""""."""
"""Yes, I want to replace it, I have done that before."""
"""Go to File, Open."""
"""So, here this is my basic image."""
"""And the 1st thing I want to do is, blend this image with Meet The GIMP Logo."""
"""And for that, I make a copy of this one and mix it with the logo."""
"""I select this image by clicking and pulling this into my tool box and here I have my layer. And now, I select the logo and pull it over to this image and you get a scrap layer which is untitled and it will n"
Now I have here two layers with my images.
And I want to have 3 steps between these 2 layers.
For doing that I choose a transparency of let's say about 25%.
"""Now, I flatten this image and pull it to my """"avatar.xcf"""" image."""
I'll change these names later on.
"""I go back to the untitled image, go to Edit and Undo."""
Now I set the transparency to about 50%.
"""Right click on the layer and select Flatten image and before pulling this, I just rename the layer as frame X and in bracket I type 100 milliseconds."""
"""Now I pull this to """"avatar.xcf"""" and go back to my image."""
I press Ctrl + Z and change the Opacity of the top layer to say something about 75%.
Right click on the layer and select Flatten image.
I pull this layer to this image.
And that’s it for this animation step.
"""Now, I have to pull the logo to this image and here I have my first 3 layers of blending."""
And now I just close the scrap layer here and don’t save it.
Now we’ll look how this has worked out.
But before that I save my work here.
And now I go to Filters >> Animation and Playback.
Here is my animation.
I click on Play.
First I have to change the names of these layers before playing it.
You can rename the layers the same way as with the lot of other image word processing options.
"""Just mark the text, press Ctrl + C and double click on the next layer and press Ctrl + V and change the necessary stuff."""
Now all the frames have their proper names.
"""So I go back to my image, select Filters >> Animation >> Playback and let's look at this here."""
You see the basic image.
And it is transformed to the other image but it is very quick.
It could be little bit slower.
So I’ll change the timing to say 200 milliseconds.
So again Filters >> Animation >> Playback.
I think this is better.
The last thing to do is index this image and save it as a 'gif' image. And this is easily done.
Just go to File >> Save As and then change the Name extension to 'gif' and click on Save.
Then I get an option dialog.
And 'gif' cannot handle these layers here.
And it can only handle animation frames.
"""So, I want to save it as Animation."""
'gif' can handle only greyscale or indexed images.
"""So, I want to convert it to index result."""
These are the default settings I found. They are good enough for my stuff and I can change it but I don’t think it's necessary.
"""So, I click on Export."""
Here you can see Created With GIMP and Loop forever.
"""In Frame disposal, I want to replace One frame per layer."""
"""And these other options are unchecked, so I leave them unchecked. Because if I want to change the timings to 5000 or 2000 milliseconds then I can do it."""
Now click on Save and we will look at the result.
"""And for that, we'll not use GIMP but Mozilla."""
In Mozilla it works as expected.
Good bye up to next week.
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on Loops in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about- while, do-while, for  and more looping constructs in awk."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and gedit text editor 3.20.1."""
You can use any text editor of your choice.
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the previous awk tutorials on our website."""
You should have familiarity with any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
A loop allows us to perform one or more actions repeatedly.
"""while, do-while and for are the available loops in awk."""
The syntax of 'while' loop can be seen here.
While loop first checks whether the specified condition is true.
"""If yes, then it executes the code within the body. This loop will be repeated as long as the specified while condition is true."""
We will use the same awkdemo.txt file that we have used earlier.
I have already written a script named while_loop.awk.
The same file is available in the Code Files link of this tutorial.
"""Here, we have set the field separator as Pipe symbol."""
"""Initially, we have to set the value of the loop variable i as 1."""
"""Here, we have taken one more variable f and initialized it to 1."""
Variable f represents the field counter or the position of the fields for each record.
"""Now, in the while condition, we check if i is less than or equal to 3."""
"""If yes, then it will print the value in the fth field, for that record in awkdemo.txt file."""
Then we will increment the field counter f by 1.
"""After that, we will also increment the value of loop variable i by 1."""
This printf is for printing a newline character at the end of each row.
This loop will be executed for all the records in the awkdemo.txt file.
"""Which means, the first 3 fields will get printed for each record."""
Let’s execute this code now.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using cd command.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space while_loop.awk space awkdemo.txt. Press Enter."""
Observe that we get the first three fields of all the rows in the output.
Let us do the same with the do-while loop.
The syntax of do-while loop can be seen here.
The do-while loop always executes the code inside the body once.
"""Then it checks the specified condition. And, repeats the code inside the body, as long as the specified conditionis true."""
I have already written a script and named it as do_loop.awk. The same file is available in the Code Files link.
"""In this code, these are the statements within the do loop which will be executed first. This is the condition that will be checked."""
"""After that, the statements inside the loop will be executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true."""
"""This loop will iterate for all the records in the awkdemo.txt file. Which means, the first 3 fields will get printed for all the records."""
Let’s switch to the terminal. Let me clear the terminal.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space do underscore loop dot awk space awkdemo dot txt. Press Enter."""
We get the same output. Then why do we have both while and do-while loops?
Let us understand the difference.
Switch to the file while underscore loop dot awk.
"""Now, change the value of loop counter i from 1 to 4."""
"""This will make the specified condition false from the beginning. So, this means, we should not get any output."""
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
"""Clear the terminal. Now, press  the up-arrow key until you get the command for executing the while loop."""
"""See, we are not getting any output apart from blank lines."""
"""For each record in the awkdemo.txt file, blank lines are getting printed in the output."""
"""Now, let us make some changes in the do loop file."""
Switch to the file do underscore loop dot awk.
Change the value of i from 1 to 4.
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Clear the terminal. Now press the up-arrow key until you get the command for do loop. Press Enter.
"""In the output, only the first field for each row is printed. What is the reason?"""
"""For each row, awk first prints the value at the first field  because value of variable f is initialized to 1. Then the condition is checked."""
"""Since the value of the loop counter i is 4, then the condition is false. Hence, the loop is terminated there only, for that record."""
This loop will iterate for all the records in the awkdemo.txt file.
"""Which means, the first field for each record will get printed."""
We are getting the output at least once for each record.
"""Use the do-while loop for a job to be executed at least once, irrespective of any other condition."""
We can do the same with the for loop also.
The syntax of for loop can be seen here.
The 'for' statement starts by executing initialization.
"""Then, as long as the condition is true, it repeatedly executes the statements within and then increments."""
"""Assuming your familiarity with a language like C or C++, I am not explaining the syntax in detail."""
This is how  for loop for this condition looks like.
"""Here, initialization, condition checking and variable incrementation are done in the same line."""
Try this out by yourself.
"""There are some more looping constructs:  break,  continue,  exit."""
We will see some relevant examples on these in further tutorials.
We may have a single and multiline comments in our file.
"""Here, notice that the single line comments are declared with single hash (#) symbol."""
The multiline comments are declared with the help of double hash (##) symbol.
"""Now, there is no point of checking and printing these comments in the output."""
We have to skip the lines starting with hash (##) symbol. How can we do this?
Recall the case of giving 50% increment in the stipend for those who are getting more than 8000.
We will use the same example for skipping the comments.
"""I have created a file named next.awk as shown here, for this execution."""
"""Now, what does this command mean?"""
awk will search for the pattern caret sign hash symbol(^#) at the beginning of each line.
"""If the pattern is found, the keyword next tells awk to skip the current line immediately."""
Then awk will start processing from the next line in the file. This will save the processing time.
Switch to the terminal and type the command as shown here. Press Enter.
We get the output without any comments.
"""Suppose, we have the students’ records in multiple files with the same format. Say, in awkdemo_mod.txt and awkdemo2.txt."""
"""See, it is similar to our previous file."""
It also has comments preceded with hash  symbol.
"""And, it has large text at the end with double hash ## symbol."""
"""So, our data is in two different files. awk should process both the files to give an increment to all the students."""
"""Once we reach double hash(##) symbol of the first file, awk should stop processing that file entirely."""
Then it has to start the execution from the next file. This will save the processing time.
Modify the next.awk as shown here.
"""I have added: dollar zero tilde slash caret symbol double hash slash within braces nextfile semicolon, below the BEGIN statement."""
This will search for double hash # symbol at the beginning of each line.
"""If found, awk will skip the current file to process the next file."""
Save this file.
Switch to the the terminal and type the following command. Press Enter.
"""See, we are getting the output from both the files."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learnt about-  while,  do… while,  for,  next,  nextfile in awk."""
"""As an assignment for the student records of awkdemo2.txt,  print only even fields(i.e. field 2, field 4 etc.)  irrespective of how many fields are there in the input file."""

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Linux File Attributes.
"""The prerequisite for this tutorial is to create empty files named as  example1, example2, example3, example4, example5 and testchown."""
Please create empty directories named as test_chown and directory1 also.
A file attribute is metadata that describes or is associated with a computer file.
"""File attribute is the characteristics that describe a file, such as owner, file type, access permissions, etc."""
"""c-h own command is used to change the ownership of the file or directory. This is an admin command, root user only can change the owner of a file or directory."""
The syntax of the chown command is: chown space options space ownername space filename or directoryname.
We may give the following options with chown command.
-R : To change the permission on files that are in the sub-directories of the directory that you are currently in.
-c : Change the permission for each file.
-f : Prevents ch own from displaying error messages.
"""Now, we will look at some examples."""
"""So, go to the terminal. We will move to the directory where we have created empty files and folders. For that, cd space Desktop slash file attribute and press Enter."""
Now type the command: ls space -l space testchown that is t-e-s-t-c-h-o-w-n and press Enter.
"""Here we can see the owner of the testchown is """"shahid""""."""
"""To change the owner of the file, type the command sudo space c-h own space a-n-u-s-h-a anusha space testchown that is t-e-s-t-c-h-o-w-n  and press Enter."""
Enter the sudo password and press Enter again. Press Enter.
"""Now type: ls space -l space t-e-s-t-c-h-o-w-n and press Enter. Here, we can see the new owner of the file is """"anusha""""."""
Now we will see how to change owner of the directory.
"""Type the command:  ls space -l and  press Enter. Here we can see the owner of the directory test_chown is """"shahid""""."""
"""To change the owner of the directory, type the command:"""
sudo space chown space minus capital R space a-n-u-s-h-a anusha space test_chown which is directory name and press Enter.
"""Enter the sudo password, if required, and press Enter again."""
"""I will clear the screen by pressing Clt+L for our convenience. Now type: ls space -l  and press Enter. Here we can see the new owner of the directory is """"anusha""""."""
chmod command is used to change the access mode or permissions of one or more files.
Syntax of the chmod command is:  chmod space [options] space mode space filename We may give the following options with the chmod command-
-c : Print information about files that are changed.
-f : Do not notify user of files that chmod cannot change.
There are following types of access or permissions-
r: that is Read w: that is Write  x: that is Execute  s: that is Set user (or group) ID.
"""Alternatively, we may specify permissions by a three-digit octal-number."""
"""The first digit stands for owner permission, the second stands for group permission and the third stands for other permission."""
Permissions are calculated by adding the following octal values- 4: that is Read  2: that is Write  1: that is Execute.
Now we will look at some examples of chmod. Move to terminal and enter the command to add execute-by-user permission to file example1.
Before that I will again clear the screen by pressing Clt+l.
"""Now, let's type chmod space u+x space example1  press Enter."""
"""Now, type: ls space -l space example1  press Enter to see the changes."""
"""Here, you can see to assign the read/write/execute permission by owner,  read/execute permission by group, and execute-only permission by others to file 'example1'."""
Now type the command: chmod space 751 space example1 press Enter.
Now type:  ls space -l space example1  and press Enter.
"""Here we can see that above command has assigned the read/write/execute permission by owner, read/execute permission by group and execute-only permission by others to file example1."""
"""To assign read-only permission to file example1 for everyone, type the command:  chmod space =r space example1 and press Enter."""
Now type the command: ls space -l space example1 press Enter.
Here we can see that the read only permission has been assigned to file 'example1' for everyone.
"""To change the permission recursively and assign the read and execute access for everyone and also write access for the owner of the directory 'directory1', type the command:"""
chmod space minus capital R space 755 space directory1 press Enter.
Now type:  ls space -l  press Enter to see the changes.
"""To give the user execute permission on file 'example2',  type the command:  chmod space u+x space example2  press Enter."""
Now type the command:  ls space -l space example2  and press Enter.
"""Here, we can see that execute permission has been assigned to user on 'example2'."""
"""To add the write permissions to the group for file 'example3', type the command: chmod space g+w space example3. Press Enter."""
"""And now, type:  ls space -l space example3  press Enter."""
Here we can see the write permission has been added to group.
"""To remove the write permissions for all, type the command:  chmod space a-w space example3 press Enter."""
Now type:  ls space -l space example3  press Enter.
Here we can see the write permission for all has been removed.
chgrp command is used to change the group of one or more files to new group.
New group is either a group ID number or a group name located in /etc/group.
Only the owner of a file or a privileged user may change the group.
The syntax for the chgrp command is: chgrp space [options] space newgroup space files.
Let's go to terminal. Now we will look at some examples of chgrp command. Type the command  ls space -l space example4 press Enter.
"""Here we can see the group permission is for user """"shahid""""."""
"""To change the group permission, type the command: sudo space chgrp space rohit space example4."""
Press Enter. Enter the 'sudo' password if required.
Now type the command:  ls space -l space example4 . Press Enter.
"""Here we can see that the group has changed from """"shahid"""" to """"rohit""""."""
The inode-number is a unique integer assigned to a device.
Inode stores basic information about a regular file or a directory.
All the files are hard-links to inodes.
"""Whenever a program refers to a file by name, the system actually uses the filename to search for the corresponding inode."""
We can use  ls space -i command to see the inode-number of a file.
Type the command:  ls space -i space example5  press Enter.
Number written before the file is the inode-number of the file.
Inodes are associated with precisely one directory at a time.
Hard links are to associate multiple directory entries with a single inode. ln is the command to make link.
The syntax of ln command to create the hard link is:
ln space source space link  where source is an existing file and link is the file to create.
Now we will look at some examples of hard-links.
Let me clear the screen again. Now type the command: ln space example1 space exampleln press Enter.
"""To display the inode number of both the files, type the command: ls space -i space example1 space exampleln press Enter."""
Here we can see that inode number of both the files are same; file 'exampleln' is the hard-link for file 'example1'.
Soft-link i.e. symbolic link is a special type of file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path.
The syntax of ln command to create soft links is:
ln space -s space {target-filename} space {symbolic-filename}.
Now we will look at some examples of soft-link.
"""To create the soft-link, type the command: ln space -s space example1 space examplesoft ."""
Press Enter.
"""Now, to display the inode number and list of both the files, type the command: ls space -li space example1 space examplesoft."""
Press Enter.
Here we can see that inode number of both the files are different and 'examplesoft' is a soft-link of 'example1'.
"""So, in this tutorial we have learnt about the Linux Files Attributes like changing permission, ownership and group of a file."""
"""We also learnt about the inode, soft and hard-links of a file."""
This brings me to the end of this tutorial.
"""Spoken Tutorials are a part of the """"Talk to a Teacher"""" project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""
More information on the same is available at the following link.
This script is contributed by Anusha Ambala and Shahid. Thanks or joining.
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on the Linux environment and ways to manipulate it.
A working Linux system will be required to try out the examples illustrated in this tutorial.
"""We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands, file systems and shell."""
"""If you are interested or need to brush these concepts up, please feel free to do so through another spoken tutorial available on our website."""
Please note that Linux is case sensitive and all the commands used in this tutorial are in lower case unless otherwise mentioned.
"""The Linux environment determines how the operating system behaves with you, how it responds to your commands, how it interprets your actions and so on."""
Linux can be highly customized by changing the settings of the shell.
Let us understand how all this can be done.
The behavior of the shell is generally determined by the shell variables.
There are mainly two kinds of shell variables: Environment Variables and Local Variables.
"""Environment variables, named so because they are available entirely in the user's total environment."""
These are also available in sub-shells spawned by the shell like the ones for running shell scripts.
Local Variables which as the name suggests have a more restricted or limited availability.
These are not available in the sub-shells spawned by the shell.
"""While in this tutorial, we will mainly talk about environment variables. Let us first see how the value of these shell variables can be seen."""
"""To see all the variables available in the current shell, we run the command 'set'."""
Type at the terminal: set space pipeline character more and press Enter.
"""We can see all the current shell variables. ,"""
For example- take a look at the HOME environment variable; also notice the value assigned to it.
"""Press Enter to move through the list and in order to come out, press q."""
"""Here, the output from set was pipe-lined to more in order to display a more systematic multi-page output of the variable list."""
"""To see only the environment variables, run the command 'env'."""
Type at the terminal: env  space 'vertical-bar' more and press Enter.
"""For example, notice the SHELL variable whose value is slash bin slash bash."""
"""Again, you may press q to come out of the list."""
"""Now, let us discuss some of the more important environment variables in Linux."""
We would be using bash shell for all our demonstrations here.
Different shells are customized in slightly different ways.
"""To see what a variable actually stores, we have to prefix a dollar sign to the name of that variable and use the echo command along with it."""
The first environment variable that we would see is the SHELL variable.
It stores the name of the current shell.
"""To see what is the value of the SHELL variable, type at the terminal: echo space dollar S-H-E-L-L in capitals and press Enter."""
"""Here, slash bin slash bash is the shell where we are currently operating."""
The next variable is HOME.
"""When we login into Linux, it normally places us in a directory named after our user name."""
This directory is called the home directory and this is exactly what is available in the 'HOME' variable.
"""To see the value, type at the terminal: echo space dollar H-O-M-E in capital and press Enter."""
The next environment variable is  PATH.
The PATH variable contains the absolute paths of the directories that the shell is supposed to search for locating any executable command.
Let's see the value of the path variable.
"""Again, type at the terminal: echo space dollar P-A-T-H  in capitals and press Enter."""
"""On my computer, it shows slash user slash local slash bin slash user slash bin etc."""
This may slightly vary from one system to another.
"""It is actually a list of directories separated by the :(colon) delimiter, that the shell would search in this order for finding an executable command."""
We can also add our own directory to this list so that our directory is also searched by the shell.
"""In order to add our own directory, type at the terminal:"""
P-A-T-H in capitals 'equal-to' dollar P-A-T-H again in capital colon  slash home slash the name of my own home directory and press Enter.
"""Now, if we echo the value of PATH,"""
our added directory will also be a part of the PATH variable.
"""See, the directory is now present here."""
Another interesting variable is the LOGNAME.
It stores the username of the currently active user.
"""In order to see the value, type: echo space dollar LOGNAME and press Enter."""
"""When we open the terminal, we can see the dollar sign which is the prompt at which we enter all our commands."""
This is the primary prompt string represented by the environment variable 'PS1'.
There is a secondary prompt string also.
If our command is long and it spans for more than one line then from the second line onwards we can see a greater than sign “>” as the prompt.
This is the secondary prompt string represented by the environment variable 'PS2'.
"""To see the value of the 'secondary command prompt', type at the terminal: echo space dollar PS2  and press Enter."""
We may change our 'primary prompt string' to say “at the rate” (@) at the prompt.
"""In order to get this done, type:  PS1  'equal-to' now within quotes 'at the rate(@)' “ and press Enter."""
"""Now, instead of the dollar sign we can see the at the rate sign as the prompt."""
We may do something more interesting like- we may display our username at the prompt.
Just type: PS1 in capital 'equal-to' within quotes dollar LOGNAME and press Enter.
"""Now, my username is my prompt."""
"""To revert back, type: PS1 'equal-to' dollar ($) within quotes and press Enter."""
We have assigned values to many of the environment variables.
"""But, remember one thing that these modifications are only applicable for the current session"""
like we had just added our directory to the PATH variable.
"""If we close the terminal and open it again or open a new terminal altogether and check the 'path' variable by echoing its value,"""
we will be surprised to see that our modifications are no longer present.
The way by which we can make these modifications permanent will be covered in some advanced tutorial.
Often we want to re-execute a command that we had executed in the recent past. What do we do? Do we have to type the entire command again?
"""No, there are a number of solutions."""
"""First, normally if you press the up-key on your keyboard then it will show the last command that you have typed."""
Keep pressing it and it will keep scrolling through the previous commands.
"""To go back, press the down-key."""
"""But when you have to scroll through many commands, this becomes a little clumsy and tedious. A better way is to use the history command."""
Type at the prompt history
and press Enter; see a list of previously executed commands appears.
"""If instead of the large list, you wanted to see only the last ten,"""
type: history space 10' and press Enter.
"""Notice, in this list, there is a number assigned to each of the previously executed commands."""
"""In order to repeat a particular command,"""
"""just type an exclamation mark followed by the number of the command. For example- 442 in my case, would execute echo space dollar PATH."""
"""If you need to re-execute the last command, simply type exclamation mark twice and press Enter."""
The next thing we would see is called tilde substitution. The tilde(~) character is a shorthand for the home directory.
"""So, say you have a directory with the name 'testtree' in your home directory. You can move to it by typing: cd space ~(tilde) slash testtree."""
One may also toggle between the current working directory and the last directory used by giving the command: cd  '~(tilde)' minus or only cd  minus
"""Like now that we are in the testtree directory, the last directory we visited was the home directory."""
"""So, if we run cd space minus and press Enter, it will go to the home directory."""
Run it again and it will take us back to the testtree directory.
The last but quite important command we will see is the alias command.
It may quite happen that you have a large command that needs to be run again and again.
"""In this case, we can give it a short alias name and use the alias name instead to invoke it."""
"""Assuming that you have such a long directory hierarchy that you frequently visit for music, you may create an alias for it like this."""
Type: alias space cdMusic 'equal-to' within double quotes cd space slash home slash the name of my own home directory slash music  and press Enter.
"""Now, every time you need to switch to this directory, simply write cdMusic and press Enter."""
"""See, we are in the music directory now."""
"""Now, you may type cd space minus  and the prompt to go back to the previous working directory."""
"""To unset an alias, simply write unalias space cdMusic and press Enter."""
"""Now again if you fire cdMusic from the terminal, you will get an error stating that the command was not found."""
"""Suppose, we have two files- test1 and test2 in our present working directory"""
"""and if we fire rm test1, test1 is silently deleted."""
We know that hyphen i option of the rm command  makes the removal process interactive.
"""So, we may set an alias like, alias rm equal-to, now within quotes rm space hyphen i."""
"""Now, when we run rm, rm hyphen i will actually be run."""
"""So, we saw that while test1 was silently deleted, system asked before deleting test2."""
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learned about environment variables, history and aliasing."""
This brings me to the end of this tutorial.

More information on the same is available from our website.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on getting started with the First java program.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
To create a simple Java program
To compile the program
To run the program and
About the naming conventions followed in Java.
Here we are using Ubuntu version 11.10 and jdk 1.6.
"""To follow this tutorial, JDK 1.6 must be installed on your system."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorial, please visit our website which is as shown."""
"""Alright, now let us write our first Java program."""
"""For that, you need a Terminal and you need  a Text Editor."""
I am using gedit as my Text Editor.
"""In the text editor, we will first create the class HelloWorld."""
"""So, type: class HelloWorld. """"HelloWorld"""" is the name of the class."""
"""And, open curly bracket. Enter and close curly bracket."""
The code between these two curly brackets  will belong to the class 'HelloWorld'.
Now save the file by clicking on Save icon at the top.
It is a good practice to save the file frequently.
so Save As Dialog box  appears.
Browse the location where you want to save your file.
"""Here, in the home directory, I will create a folder."""
Let us name it Demo and press Enter.
"""Then, inside this folder we will save the file."""
"""In the Name text-box, type the name of the class."""
"""In Java, the name of the class and the file name should be same."""
Recall that we  created   class HelloWorld.
"""So, we will save the file as  HelloWorld dot java."""
Dot Java (.java) is the file extension  given to the Java file.
Then click on Save button. So the file is now saved.
"""Inside the class, we write the main method."""
"""So, type: public static void main parentheses inside   parentheses String arg square brackets."""
main function marks the starting point of the program.
"""We will describe public, static, void and String in a future tutorial."""
"""Then  once again, open curly bracket,"""
press Enter and close curly bracket.
The code between these two curly brackets will belong to the main method.
We will now write a code to display a line on the Terminal.
"""So, inside main method, type: System dot out dot println parentheses semicolon."""
This is the statement used to print a line.
Semicolon is used to terminate a line.
"""Now let us tell Java, what to print."""
"""So, within parentheses in double quotes, type: My first Java program exclamation mark."""
Let us save the file by clicking on Save icon.
Let's go to the Terminal.
Make sure that you are in the directory where  you saved your  'HelloWorld.java'
Remember that I am in my home directory.
"""So, type: cd Space Demo  and hit Enter."""
"""ls, press Enter."""
We see  'HelloWorld.java' file present in the 'Demo' folder.
"""Let's compile this file. So, type: javac Space  HelloWorld dot java and hit Enter."""
This compiles the file that we have created.
"""Alright, now the file is compiled as we see no error."""
We can see HelloWorld.class file created.
This file can run anywhere.
"""That is, on any Operating System."""
We do not need java compiler as well.
"""Hence, java is rightly described as “write once, run anywhere.”"""
"""So, after successful compilation, run the program using the command,"""
java(This time no c) space HelloWorld(and no dot java extension) and hit Enter.
You  will get the output My first java program!
"""So, we have written our first java program. Let us go back to the editor."""
"""Now, remove the semicolon  which is at the end of the statement."""
Click on Save icon.
Let us go back to the Terminal.
Run the command javac HelloWorld dot java.
The compiler gives an error.
"""It says, a semicolon (;) is expected on the fifth line."""
The up-arrow points to the error statement.
Let us go back to the Editor.
"""In Java, all statements are terminated with semicolons."""
"""So, go to the fifth line and add a semicolon."""
Click on the Save icon. It is necessary to save the file before compiling.
Compile the file using javac HelloWorld dot java.
The file is successfully compiled as we see no errors.
"""Now, run the program using the command java HelloWorld and"""
we see the output My first Java program!
This is how you handle errors in java.
"""As the series progresses, we will learn more about the errors."""
We now see what are the naming conventions in java.
The class name should be in CamelCase
which means each new word begins with an upper case.
"""Example: class HelloWorld, class ChessGame."""
"""So, 'H' of 'Hello' and  'W' of 'World' are in uppercase."""
"""Similarly, 'C' and 'G' of 'ChessGame' respectively are in uppercase."""
The method name should be the mixed case.
which means that the first word should begin with a lowercase.
and all new words followed should begin with an uppercase.
Also the method name should be a verb.
"""For Example: showString(), main(), goToHelp(). Here 's' of show is in lowercase while 'S' of string is in uppercase."""
The variable name should not begin with digits.
"""We cannot use keywords for our class, method or variable name."""
"""For example:  cannot use keywords like public, private, void, static and many more."""
"""So in this tutorial, we have learnt to write, compile and run a simple java program."""
We also saw the naming conventions followed in java.
"""For self assessment, write a simple java program to print """"Java file name and class name should be same""""."""

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Installation of Koha on Ubuntu Linux OS.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to install Koha Library Management System on Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04  and cross-verify the installation."""
"""This tutorial is recorded using:  Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04, Koha version 16.05,"""
gedit text editor and   Firefox web browser.
"""Before you start, please ensure that your machine has-  Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04,"""
"""any text editor, either Firefox or Google Chrome web browser."""
"""The minimum hardware requirements are-  i3 processor or above,"""
"""500GB hard disk or more,"""
Minimum 4GB RAM and  Network facility.
The commands used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link below the player.
"""I have opened this file in gedit text editor on my machine. And, I will use the same file to copy paste the commands during the demonstration."""
Let’s begin. Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously on the keyboard.
We have to first of all ensure that our Ubuntu Linux installation is up-to-date.
"""For that, copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
"""From now on, type the System password whenever prompted during this installation. And, press Enter."""
This command will create a file named koha.list and update the package repository.
Please note: Koha 16.05 was the stable version at the time of creation of this tutorial.
"""Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
"""Then, this will download gpg.asc file and update the signature key."""
"""Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
"""Now, copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
This will update the new repositories.
"""Now, type sudo apt-get install koha-common and press Enter."""
Press Y when asked if you want to continue and press Enter.
This will install Koha on your system. Wait for the installation to complete. This will take some time.
"""Now, we have to open the conf file in a text editor to change the port number for Koha."""
I will use gedit text editor. You can use any text editor of your choice.
"""Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And, press Enter."""
The file opens in the text editor.
Locate the line that says INTRAPORT = 80.
Change 80 to 8080. This will change the port number to 8080.
Then save and close the file.
"""Now, we have to set up the database."""
Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. Press Enter.
Press Y when asked if you want to continue and press Enter.
"""Next, set the password for root user as admin123 for the database."""
You could give a different password if you wish.
Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. Press Enter.
"""Next, copy these two commands one by one, paste them on the terminal and press Enter."""
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod cgi
This will enable the modules of Koha.
Then type: sudo service apache2 restart
This will restart apache services.  Then press Enter.
To create a Koha instance named library- copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And press Enter.
"""Next, we have to tell Apache server that we are using port 8080."""
"""For that, we have to open the ports.conf file in a text editor."""
Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And press Enter.
"""In the ports.conf file, search for the line Listen 80."""
"""Next to that line, add Listen 8080."""
Then save and close the file.
Then restart apache services. Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. Press Enter.
"""Next, copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And press Enter."""
This is to disable the 000-default site.
The message confirms that it is  disabled. Let's move on.
"""Copy these two commands one by one, paste them on the terminal and press Enter."""
sudo a2enmod deflate and press Enter.
sudo a2ensite library and press Enter.
The message on the terminal confirms that the site library is enabled.
Copy this command from the Code file and paste it in the terminal. And press Enter.
Then type sudo su and press Enter.
We are now in the superuser that is root user mode.
"""Type the password when prompted, admin123 and press Enter."""
We are now inside our MariaDB prompt.
"""At the MariaDB prompt, type: use mysql semicolon and press Enter."""
This is to tell MariaDB to use mysql database.
The message displayed on the terminal says Database changed.
Notice that the MariaDB prompt says mysql.
Now type the following command carefully as shown and press Enter.
This will set the password for the user koha_library as koha123.
We see a message on the terminal that says “Query OK”.
"""Next, type: flush privileges semicolon and press Enter. This will update the latest changes."""
Once again we see a message on the terminal that says “Query OK”.
"""Lastly, type: quit semicolon and press Enter to exit from Mariadb."""
We are now back in the root user prompt.
We will now open the koha-conf.xml file in a text editor.
I will be doing so using gedit text editor.
"""In this file, search for the keyword 'mysql'."""
Scroll down and locate this line.
Replace the alphanumeric value with 'koha123'.
Recall that this is the password we had set for our database earlier via the terminal.
Save the file and close the editor window.
Now open any web browser. I will be opening Firefox web browser.
"""In the address bar, type: 127.0.0.1:8080 and press Enter."""
The Koha web installer page appears on the browser.
"""To login, use the credentials we set earlier."""
I will type username as koha_library and password as koha123.
"""If you had given a different username and password, then type that in."""
Now click on the Login button at the bottom right.
We are in Step 1 of Koha web installer.
"""In the language drop-down, select en for English, if it’s not already selected, by default."""
Now click on the Next button at the bottom right.
The window now displays 2 messages. The messages confirm that all Perl modules and all dependencies are installed.
Click on the Next button at the bottom right.
We are now in Step 2 – Database settings
"""Notice here, all the values are what we gave earlier."""
Then click on the Next button at the bottom.
"""On doing so, we see a message that says “Connection established”."""
This is followed by 2 more confirmation messages.
Click on the Next button at the bottom.
We are brought to Step 3.
Read what is displayed on the screen and then click on the Next button.
Soon we will see a Success message on our screen. This confirms that our database tables are created.
Now click on the Next button at the bottom to continue.
"""Immediately, we are brought to this screen."""
Read the displayed text and then click on the link install basic configuration settings.
"""On doing so, we are asked to select our MARC flavor. I am going to select MARC21."""
Then click on the Next button at the bottom.
"""In this screen, scroll-down to the section Mandatory."""
"""Here, we see that the Default MARC21 check-boxes are selected."""
"""Under Optional section, select all the options as shown."""
"""As we scroll down, we see that under Other data, all the check-boxes are already selected."""
Keep scrolling to the bottom of the page.
"""There is one more Optional section below, which is very long."""
"""Here, locate the option “Some basic currencies” and select it."""
"""After this, select the option “Useful patron attribute types”."""
Now go to the bottom of the page and click on the Import button.
This will enable all the selected functionalities in Koha.
We are now brought to a new page. Scroll down this page and read all the text displayed on the screen.
We can see a success message “All done”.
"""Now, click on the Finish button."""
We see the final message on our screen which confirms that our installation is successful.
We will now be moved to the Koha interface.
Type the username as koha_library and password as koha123.
Select My Library from the drop-down.
Then click on the Login button.
We are brought to the Koha Administration page.
We can see various tabs on this page.
We will learn how to use many of these later in this series.
"""Now, click on No Library Set and select the Logout option."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.

"""On the left side, click on Site Administration."""
Click on the Courses tab and then on Manage courses and categories.
Note that we have only one category here which is Mathematics.
And two subcategories: 1st Year Maths and 2nd Year Maths which we created earlier.
"""Now, let us create a new course under Mathematics."""
"""So, click on Create new course."""
"""And, in the Add a new course screen, click on Expand All at the top right, in order to view all the fields."""
"""In the Course full name text-box, we will type Calculus."""
"""In Course short name, we will again type Calculus."""
Course short name will be used in the breadcrumbs and course related emails.
This can also be different from the course full name.
"""Course Category is Mathematics, as we can see."""
"""Next option is Course visibility. By default, Show is selected."""
The Visible setting determines whether the course will be shown along with other courses or not.
"""A hidden course is visible only to those assigned to the course, like- Admin, Course creator, Teacher, Manager."""
"""We will leave this setting as it is, for now."""
Next comes the Course start date.
"""If the course begins on a particular date like semester start date, select that in the start date."""
This means the course will not be visible to the students till the start date.
"""Course end date, by default, is enabled and set to the same date that the course is created."""
Let me disable it by clicking on the checkbox. This would mean that the course will never end.
"""However, if there is an end date for the course, you can enable the checkbox here. Then select the date as per your requirement."""
Important note: The course will not be visible to the students after the selected end date. I will leave it disabled.
Course ID number is similar to Category ID number. Course ID number is an optional field.
This is for admin users to identify the course with offline courses.
"""If your college uses IDs for courses, then you can use that course ID here. This field is not visible to other Moodle users."""
This field is optional and is not displayed anywhere on the website. I am going to leave this as blank.
"""Next, under Description, we can see 2 fields: Course Summary and Course Summary files."""
Course summary is an optional but important field. That is because the course summary text is also scanned when a user performs a search.
"""Listing topic names is a good idea here. Type the following:Topics covered in this Calculus course are: Limits,Graph of a function, Factorial."""
Course summary is also displayed along with the list of courses.
Course summary files must be uploaded in Course summary files field.
"""By default, only jpg, gif and png file types are allowed as course summary files. I will skip this as I do not wish to upload any file."""
Course format refers to the way resources and activities are organized for students.
"""There are 4 options in the Format dropdown - Single Activity Format, Social Format, Topics Format and Weekly Format."""
There are courses that run week by week.
"""If your course is like that, then select Weekly format."""
"""Moodle will create a section for each week of the course, with a clear start date and an end date."""
"""There are courses that run topic wise. If your course is like that, then select Topics   format."""
Moodle will create a section for each topic of the course.
The default for this field is Topics format. We will let it remain as it is.
"""The number of sections, by default, is 4."""
"""If you have your course divided in more or less than 4 topics, change this field as required. I will make this number as 5."""
We will discuss the other formats in later tutorials.
Let’s leave the rest of the options as they are. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Save and display button.
We are redirected to the Enrolled Users page. We will learn about user enrollment in a later tutorial.
"""For now, we have successfully created our first course Calculus under the category Mathematics."""
"""While we are on this course page, notice that the menu on the left has changed."""
"""The navigation menu on the left has menus related to the course we created. These include Participants, Grades etc."""
Click on the course name Calculus on the left.
"""We can see that 5 topics are visible here. They are named Topic 1, Topic 2 and so on. Recall we had given this number 5 earlier."""
Click on the gear icon at the top right of the page.
"""Then click on Edit settings. This will open a page similar to the page we were on, when we created this course."""
We can make changes to the previous settings on this page. I will change the Course start date to 15th October 2017.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the Save and display button.
We will explore the other sub-menus under the gear menu later.
Let us now change the structure of our course a little bit.
Click on Site administration. Click on Courses and then Manage courses and categories.
Click on Mathematics category to see the course we created. Notice 3 icons on the right of the course.
Hover over the icons to see what they are.
The gear icon is for editing a course. The delete or trash icon is for deleting a course.
"""And, the eye icon is for hiding a course."""
A hidden course will have the eye crossed to indicate the same.
"""We can click on the gear icon to the right of the course name, to edit the course settings."""
I want to modify the Course Summary and add Binomials to the existing topics. Rest of the settings can remain the same.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and this time click on the Save and return button.
Here is a small assignment for you: create a new course Linear Algebra under the category Mathematics.
Hide this course for now.
"""Mention the following topics in course summary: Linear equations, Matrices and Vectors. Click on Save and Return button."""
Pause the tutorial and continue when done with the assignment.
We now have 2 courses under Mathematics: Calculus and Linear Algebra.
Notice that a new icon has appeared next to the courses now.
The up and down arrows are to re-arrange the order of the courses.
We can also change the order using the drag and drop feature. Let us move the Calculus course above the Linear Algebra course.
"""Both these courses are for 1st year students. So, let us move them under the 1st Year Maths subcategory."""
Check the checkbox to the left of the 2 courses in order to select them.
"""Then in the drop-down Move selected courses to, select Mathematics / 1st year Maths."""
And click on the Move button.
We get a success message -Successfully moved 2 courses into 1st year Maths.
Note that the number of courses under Mathematics has become 0 and that under 1st year Maths is 2.
Click on 1st year Maths sub-category.
We can see our courses listed under this subcategory.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt: how to create a course, how to perform actions like edit, move, etc. on courses."""
"""Here is an assignment for you: Add 2 courses to the subcategory 2nd Year Maths under Mathematics, namely-"""
Multivariable calculus and   Advanced Algebra.

Edit the courses to start on 15th October 2017.
Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Arrays in C and C++.
In this tutorial we will learn:
What is an array
Declaration of an array
Initialization of an array
Few Examples on array.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04,gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 ."
Let us start with the introduction to Array.
Array is the collection of data or elements of same data-type.
Array index starts from 0.
The first element is stored at index 0.
There are three types of arrays:
Single dimensional array
Two dimensional array and
Multi-dimensional array.
We will be discussing single dimensional array in this tutorial.
Let us see how to declare single dimensional array.
The Syntax for this is:
data-type name of the array and size
"""example, here we have declared an integer array 'star' which contains 5 elements."""
The array index will start from star 0 to star 4.
We saw the declaration of an array.
"""Now, we will see the initialization of an array."""
The Syntax for this is:
"""data-type,( name of the array ), size is equal to elements"""
"""example: here we have declared an 'integer array star' with size 3. The elements of the array are 1,2 and 3."""
Here the index will start from star 0 to star 2.
"""Now, lets us move to the examples."""
I have already typed the program on the editor.
"""So, let me open it."""
Please note that our file name is array.c
"""In this program, we will calculate the sum of the elements stored in an array."""
This is our main() function.
"""Here, we have declared and initialized an array star with size 3."""
"""The elements of the array are 4, 5 and 6."""
Then we have declared an 'integer variable' sum.
Here we add the elements of the array and store the result in sum.
"""Note that 4 will be stored at index 0, 5 will be stored at index 1 and 6 will be stored at index 2."""
Then we print the sum.
This is our return statement.
"""Now, click on Save."""
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T  keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space array dot c space hypen o array and press Enter."""
"""To execute, type dot slash array (./array). Press Enter."""
"""Here the output is displayed as,"""
The sum is 15.
Now let us see some common errors which we can come across.
Come back to our program.
"""Suppose, here at line number 4, we miss the curly brackets."""
Click on Save. Let us see what happens.
Come back to the terminal.
Let us compile as before.
We see an error:
Invalid initializer and Expected identifier or bracket before numeric constant.
This is because arrays must be initialized within curly brackets.
Come back to our program. Let us fix the error.
Type the curly brackets here at line number 4.
Lets us execute. Come back to the terminal.
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.
"""Yes, it is working."""
Now we will execute the same program in C++.
I will change a few things here.
"""First, press Shift , Ctrl and S keys  simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with the extension dot cpp (.cpp) and click on Save.
Let us change the  header file as iostream.
Now include the using statement.
The declaration and initialization of an array is same in C++.
Hence no need to change anything here.
Now replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
"""Delete the format specifier and backslash n (), now delete the comma and type two opening angle brackets."""
Delete the bracket here. Again type two opening angle brackets and within the double quotes type backslash n ().
Let us execute. Come back to a terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space array dot cpp space hyphen o space array1"""
Here we have array1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter array for the file array dot c.
"""To execute type, dot slash array1(./array1) . Press Enter."""
The output is displayed as: The sum is 15
We can see that it is similar to our C code.
"""Now, we will see another common error."""
"Suppose here, at line number 7, I will type star[1],  star[2] and  star[3]"
click on Save.Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
Let me clear the prompt.
Let us execute as before.
We get an unexpected output.
This is because array index starts from 0.
Come back to our program. We can see here the array index starts from one.
Hence it is giving an error. Let us fix the error.
Type 0 here 1 and 2. Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
Let us compile as before. Execute as before.
"""Now, we will go back to our slides."""
In this tutorial we learned:
"""Arrays , To declare Single Dimensional Arrays"""
To initialize Single Dimensional Arrays
"""example int star[3]={4, 5, 6}"""
"""To add the elements of the array, example sum is equal to star 0 plus star 1 plus star 2."""
"""As an assignment, write a program to calculate the difference of the elements stored in an array."""
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on sed - the stream editor.
"""In this tutorial,  we will learn usage of sed command."""
We will do through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial,"""
I am using Linux  Operating System and GNU BASH version 4.2.24
"Please note, GNU bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
"""As prerequisites,"""
you should know basics of Linux terminal.
"""For relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown: http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Let us start with an introduction to sed.
sed is a stream editor.
sed finds some pattern of text in a particular location of a file.
It performs some display or editing function-
"""editing functions like insertion, substitution and deletion in matched text."""
Let us start with some examples.
We will see how to print using the sed command.
I have a file called seddemo.txt in the home directory.
Let us view its contents.
"""In this file, we have some entries like- roll no, name, stream, marks, pass or fail and the stipend amount."""
"""Now suppose, we want to print the second line of the file."""
"""For this, we need to open the terminal."""
"""Now, type:sed space within  single quotes 2p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt"""
"""Here, 2 denotes the location which is the second line."""
'p' denotes the action which is printing.
Now look at the output.
It shows the entire file but see that the second line is printed twice.
This is the default behavior of action p.
"""To only print the second line,"""
type: sed space  -n space (within single quotes) 2p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
We see only the second line is printed.
-n stands for ‘silent mode’ which will suppress all unnecessary output.
Then we give the location in the stream that we want to edit or display.
We want to select the second line.
p indicates the action we want to take i.e. to print the second line
and seddemo.txt is the name of the file.
This is the general syntax of 'sed' command.
"""Now, let us print the last line of the file."""
Let me clear the prompt.
"""Now, type: sed space  -n space within single quotes dollar-sign p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt"""
We see that the last line is printed.
Now come back to text editor.
"""Suppose, we want to print the entries from 3rd to 6th."""
"""For this, we need to type on the terminal:"""
sed space  -n space within single quotes 3 comma 6p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
Press Enter.
The output is displayed from the third line to the sixth line.
Any of the actions can be reversed by using the exclamation mark (!) before the action.
"""Say, if we had to print all lines except from 3rd to 6th, we will type:sed space  -n space within single quotes 3 comma 6 (exclamation mark) !p"""
After the single quotes space seddemo.txt
The output is displayed.
Let us switch back to our slides.
Line addressing and context addressing.
"""So far, we specified the lines in the file on which the action needs to be taken."""
This is known as line addressing;
address specified by the line numbers.
This is one way of addressing.
Another way of addressing is Context addressing.
Lines that contain particular context say a particular word.
"""If we want to take actions on lines that contain a particular word, we use context addressing."""
Regular expressions can be used.
Let us see an example.
Come back to our text editor.
"""Say, we want to print those lines which have the word """"computers""""."""
Come back to our terminal.
"""Now, type:"""
sed space -n space within single-quotes front-slash opening square-bracket [cC] closing Square-bracket omputers/p after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
Press Enter.
"""We see the lines with the word """"computers"""" is displayed."""
We write pattern within square-brackets.
This is to match any one or both of the characters within square-brackets.
"""When we need to match patterns, the pattern needs to be typed between front slashes."""
"""We can print it in a file as well using the w option. For this, type:"""
sed space -n space within single-quotes front-slash opening square-bracket [cC] closing square-bracket omputers/w space computer_student.txt after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
"""Now, all the matching lines would be transferred to the file computer_student.txt."""
Let us view the contents.
Type: cat space computer_student.txt
We see the entries.
We can also have patterns that we can write to different files.
Let us clear the prompt.
Type: sed space -n space -e space (within single quotes) (front slash) ‘/electronics/w space electro.txt’ after the single quotes space  -e space (within single quotes) (front slash) ‘/civil/w space civil.txt
"""Here, -e is used to combine multiple methods."""
This would create two files- electro.txt and civil.txt.
"""To see what they contain, type:"""
cat space electro.txt
"""This will display the entries with the word """"electronics""""."""
"""Let us see the content of """"civil"""" file."""
Type: cat space civil.txt
"""This will display the entries having the word """"civil""""."""
We will see some more set of commands in another tutorial.
I will use the same program.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Let us switch back to our slide.
"""we will  summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt: sed"""
To print using sed.Line Addressing.
Context Addressing.
"""As an assignment,"""
"""use the same text file """"seddemo.txt""""."""
Try to print records from 6th to 12th line.

Welcome to this tutorial on BLAST using Biopython tools.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn: To run """"BLAST"""" for the query sequence using Biopython tools"""
"""And, parse the BLAST output for further analysis."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics"""
and basic Python programming.
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: * Ubuntu Operating System version 14.10"""
Python version 2.7.8
Ipython interpretor version 2.3.0
Biopython version 1.64 and * a working Internet connection.
BLAST is the acronym for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.
It is an algorithm for comparing sequence information.
The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequences in databases  and calculates the statistical significance of matches.
There are two different ways to run BLAST:
Local BLAST on your machine or run BLAST over Internet through NCBI servers.
Running BLAST in Biopython has two steps.
"""First, run BLAST for your query sequence and get some output."""
"""Second, parse the BLAST output for further analysis."""
We will open the terminal and run BLAST for a nucleotide sequence.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""At the prompt, type: ipython and press Enter."""
"""In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to run BLAST over internet using NCBI BLAST service."""
Type the following at the prompt: from Bio.Blast Import NCBIWWW Press Enter.
"""Next, to run the BLAST over internet, type the following at the prompt.result= NCBIWWW.qblast(""""blastn"""",""""nt"""",""""186429"""")."""
We will use qblast function in the NCBIWWW module.
qblast function takes three arguments:
The first argument is the blast program to use for the search.
"""Second, specifies the databases to search against."""
The third argument is  your query sequence.
"""The input for the query sequence can be in the form of GI number or a FASTA file. Or, it can also be a sequence record object."""
"""For this demonstration, I am using the GI number for a nucleotide sequence."""
The GI number is for a nucleotide sequence of insulin.
The qblast function also takes a number of other option arguments.
These arguments are analogous to the different parameters you can set on the BLAST web page.
The qblast function will return the BLAST results in xml format.
Back to the terminal.
"""We have to use the appropriate Blast program,"""
depending on whether our query sequence is a nucleotide or protein sequence.
"""Since our query is a nucleotide, we will use blastn program and """"nt"""" refers to the nucleotide database."""
Details about this are available at the NCBI BLAST webpage.
"""The blast output is stored in the variable result, in the form of an xml file."""
"""Depending upon the speed of your Internet, it may take a few minutes to complete the BLAST search."""
It is important to save the xml file on the disk before processing further.
Type the following lines to save the xml file.
These lines of code will save the search result as blast.xml in the home folder.
Navigate to your home folder and locate the file.
Click on the file and check the contents of the file.
"""Use the code shown in this text file, if you want to use a FASTA file as a query."""
"""Here is the code, if you want to use sequence record object from a FASTA file as a query."""
Back to the terminal.
The next step is to parse the file to extract data.
The first step in parsing is to open the xml file for input.
Type the following at the prompt. Press Enter.
"""Next, import the module NCBIXML from """"Bio.Blast"""" package."""
Press Enter.
Type the following lines to parse the Blast output.
A BLAST record contains all the information you want to extract from the BLAST output.
Let us print out some information about all the hits in our blast report greater than a particular threshold.
Type the following code.
"""For a match to be significant, expect score should be less than 0.01."""
"""For each hsp, that is, high scoring pair, we get the title, length, hsp score, gaps and expect value."""
"""We will also print strings containing the query, the aligned database sequence and string specifying the match and mismatch positions."""
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
Observe the output.
"""For each alignment, we have length, score, gaps, evalue and strings."""
"""You can extract the required information using other functions, available in Bio.Blast package."""
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
"""Let's summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt to run BLAST for the query nucleotide sequence using GI number."""
"""And, parse the BLAST output using Bio.Blast.Record module."""
"""For the assignment, run BLAST Search for a protein sequence of your choice."""
Save the output file and parse the data contained in the file.
"""Your completed assignment should have the following lines of code, as shown in this  file."""
"""Observe the code. Since our query is protein sequence, we have used blastp program and """"nr"""", that is, non-redundant protein database for the BLAST search."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
"""Today, I would like to teach about selective sharpening."""
Every digital image out of the camera needs to be sharpened because they are not crisp specially if you take raw images and don’t allow the processor in the camera to sharpen the image.
"""But, when you do it yourself by using the GIMP you can control the sharpening. And in today’s tutorial, I will show you how to do it."""
"""Let’s have a look at this image, here."""
"""In this image, the wire mesh in the background is the bit unsharpened area and the flower here is a bit sharpened."""
"""So, I want to sharpen the flower a bit more and keep the background as it is."""
"""But, first I want to show you why I don’t want  to sharpen the background."""
It's unsharpened now and little bit of sharpening should not do any harm.
"""So, I select the Sharpen tool by clicking on the Filters in the tool bar and pull the Sharpness slider up and you can see that the originality of the background is destroyed."""
"""But, if you look here and I take the Sharpen tool here and when I pull the slider to the extreme value, the picture dissolves."""
"""So sharpening unsharpened areas or areas which are filled with color and no details, spoils the image. And this happens because the colours in the image which need no sharpening, get sharpened."""
"""So, I’ll tell you the method of selectively sharpening which does not destroy the image."""
"""To do selective sharpening, I will work with Layers."""
"""This time, I simply make a copy of the Background layer and call it sharpen."""
"""Now, I add a layer mask to the sharpen layer and I select the Grayscale copy of the layer as the layer mask and click on Add option and you see no change has happened because the Layer mode is Normal."""
"""But, when I de-select the original Background layer, you can see that only the bright parts in the image are visible."""
"""And if you remember, white in the layer mask reveals the bright parts and black hides and you can see here most of the layer mask is dark; so they are hidden and only the bright part here is visible."""
"""Now when I use the sharpening algorithm on the layer mask, only the flower will be sharpened."""
And I also want to sharpen the leaf part.
"""And in the sharpened image, I don’t want to have the white areas in the flower and I want only the fine details."""
"""To do that, I use the 2nd filter and this is Edge-Detect."""
"""This is the algorithm that helps for looking in the image, for the edges between bright and dull part and enhances them by making white line there."""
"""You can leave these options, here, as they are because there is not much difference between these algorithms. But I increase the value of Amount to 4 and look in the Preview."""
You can see here the background has a little bit of structure in it and in the brighter part there are thicker white lines.
I click on OK and wait for the algorithm to apply it to the image.
It works and now I get a white painting of all the edges.
"""I zoom into the image by pressing 1 and you can see here all the bright parts, now, have a white border and white line and all the other areas are nearly black."""
"""When I switch off the layer mask and  the Background layer, you can see only the edge of the flower i.e the brighter part is visible."""
Now I can sharpen the edge of the flower without affecting the colours in the background and the colour of the flower.
"""But, this would give a strange effect like a sharp line in a muddy background"""
And to avoid that I use another filter on this layer called Blur.
"""I select the layer mask and use Gaussian Blur to smash this white line a bit and I increase some value in Horizontal Blur Radius, say upto 8 and click on OK."""
Wait for the completion of the filter and now you can see that the edge of the flower is a bit more softer. And I think I need a bit more contrast in the image .
"""So, I select the Curves tool and click into the image to get the curve and I pull the curve a bit down to get the dark darker and pull the bright part up and get the white whiter."""
Click on OK and now I have thick white lines where there is a need for sharpening and black part where no sharpening should be done.
I could work on the black part but it will show no effect.
Now I disable the layer mask here and press Shift + Ctrl + E to look at the whole image.
Now you know Shift + Ctrl + E is to look at the whole image.
"""When I disable the original Background layer, I can see nearly nothing of the image."""
Let me explain you what’s happening there by adding a new layer with a White Layer Fill Type and press OK.
Now you see the areas that need to be sharpened.
Now let’s sharpen this image. I click on Filters in the tool bar and Enhance and select Sharpen.
Go to the area of the flower where sharpening is to be done and see to it the sharpen layer is selected because there is nothing to sharpen in the white layer.
"""So, select sharpen layer, then filter and Re-Show 'sharpen' and here you see the flower. And now I can pull the Sharpness slider up till I get a good sharpened image."""
And then press on OK and wait for the algorithm to work.
It works.
And now you can see that the line has more definition.
Let's switch this white layer off and see the full image.
Switch off the sharpen layer but no changes are visible in this magnification.
"""So, I zoom into the image."""
And I think you should see the effect properly.
"""When I on the sharpen layer, you see the sharpened image and when I off it, the image is not sharpened."""
"""With the help of the Opacity slider, I can control the amount of the effect."""
"""Now, I check the background and you can see I have not harmed it."""
Now I will do some fine tuning.
And I look in to the image for over-sharpened areas and the stuff which is not good enough sharpened.
The border between the flower and background is very well sharpened & with no add effects.
"""But when I go into the flower, this part looks a bit artificial and this part here is definitely over-sharpened."""
And this flower bud here is not sharp enough because the edge detect algorithm found no edges.
But as you can see there are some edges and I should have given this part a bit more boost with the help of the Levels tool or with the Curves tool.
Sharpening should always be the last step in your work flow.
Ok. I’ll come back to that later.
Now I have to reduce the sharpness of this part.
"""It’s easy, just make sure that you have selected the sharpen layer. Choose the Brush tool."""
Choose a brush with soft edges and make the brush large enough for this job by pulling the Scale slider and now select the black colour because you remember black hides & white reveals.
And pull the Opacity slider of your brush to say 20%.
"""When I move the brush here and start painting, you can see that the sharpening is reduced."""
I can show you exactly what happens here with the help of layer mask.
"""I ON the layer mask and when I paint over the white part, it turns darker."""
"""But when I turn off the layer mask, I can see the image and can see the result of my operation."""
I will look into the details later.
Now I have to do more sharpening to this part here.
I just switch the colours with ‘x’ key and start painting.
And as you can see this part gets sharper and darker.
And I think this is quite good and to check my work I switch on the layer mask and you can see the white part is what I have painted and I have done it a bit over.
"""So, I go back to the layer and change the colour by pressing 'X' key and redo the work I have done."""
We are working with the layers here; so there is no danger of losing any data.
The only thing that I can destroy now is the edge data that has been constructed by the filter.
But that can easily be redone .
"""Here, I have zoomed into the edge of the flower where the sharpening has to be done."""
"""And as you can see, the edge is sharpened here."""
"""The sharpening helps in getting a bright and dark line between the dark and the bright part of the border, between these 2 colours."""
The edge of dark part is darkened and bright part is brightened.
"""And by using the mask, you can keep the effect only to the area you want to have it."""
Let me point you to more detailed resource about sharpening.
"""Go to """"tips from the top floor.(dot)com""""- the site of Chris Markwa’s broadcast. And there on the left side, you will find somewhere a Photoshop Corner."""
"""And there he has lot of broadcast about Photoshop which nearly are usable for GIMP too. And he has made the effort as writing stuff he says in the broadcast and made some picture of it. And I’ll take some ma"
And here you can see about the sharpening effect about which I discussed in this tutorial.
He also covers the Unsharp mask and the process to avoid the halos in detail
and shows lot of different techniques to sharpen the image.
But the one I showed you is not here on this site.
"""And, by the way, when you are on this site just check out if there are still some places on learning to see workshop."""
"""This was it for this week. If you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org."""
More information is available at http://meetthegimp.org .
And I would like to hear from you.
"""Tell me what you liked, what I could have made better, what you want to see in the future."""
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project."""
The main motivation of this is to give you a head start about working with Linux.
The first command that we will see is the echo command. However note that Linux commands are 'case sensitive'.
Ctrl Alt t helps to start a terminal in Ubuntu.
This command may not work in all Unix systems however.
This prints the customary 'Hello World' message on the screen.
We can also use the 'echo' command to display the value of a variable.
We can also use escape sequences with 'echo' command.
For this in Linux we need to use the -e (hyphen e) option.
"""Common escape sequences include \t (backslash t) for tab,  for new line and \c is a escape sequence which when used causes the prompt to be displayed on the same line."""
This can be useful if say we want a prompt message before entering something.  Type at the prompt: echo space minus e within single quote  Enter a command back slash c (\c) and press Enter.
We will see that the prompt will be displayed after printing ‘Enter a command ‘ on the same line.
To know this and many other characteristics of our machine we have the uname command. Type at the prompt: uname space hyphen r and press Enter .
"""To know what is your username, type at the prompt: who space am space I and press Enter."""
This in fact comes from the who command that enlists all the users currently logged into the system in case your system is a multiuser system.
For this we have the passwd command. Type at the prompt: p-a-s-s-w-d and press Enter.
When you type this command you would be asked to type the current password.
Here I would be typing my system's current password.
But what if we have forgotten our current password?
"""Then also the password can be changed without knowing the current password, but that can only be done by the root user."""
Now who is a 'root user'?
He is a special person with extra privileges.
To draw an analogy we can say a 'root user' is similar to a user in Windows with Administrator status.
Type date in the terminal and press Enter
As we can see the date command gives both date and time. This is a very versatile utility and has many options as well.
Type at the prompt: date space plus 'percent' sign capital T and press Enter.
It gives us only the time in hours minutes and seconds (hh:mm:ss) format.
Type at the prompt: date space plus 'percentage sign small h and press Enter.
Type at the prompt: date space plus percentage sign small m and press Enter.
It gives the month of the year in numerical format. Here it is showing 02 for the month of February . Match this according to the output you are getting.
Type at the prompt: date space plus percentage sign small y and press Enter .
We can combine these options as well. For example type at the prompt: date space plus within double quotes percentage small h percentage small y and press Enter .
Here it is showing  February 11.
"""To see the calendar of any arbitrary month say December 2070, type at the prompt: cal space 12 space 2070 and press Enter."""
Before moving ahead let us discuss a little bit about files and directories.
In Linux almost everything is a file. Now the question is what is a file?
In real file a file is where we store our documents and papers. Similarly a Linux file is a container for storing information.
Next what is a directory?
When we login into the Linux system we are by default in a home directory. To see the home directory type at the prompt: echo space dollar HOME in capital and press Enter.
The next command helps us to see the directory we are currently working in. It is pwd that stands for 'present working directory'. Type at the prompt pwd and press Enter.
"""Once we know of our directory we would also want to know what are the files and sub-directories in that directory. For this, we have the ls command which is probably the most widely used command in Unix and"
"""ls is a very versatile command and has many options. Let us see some of them, type at the prompt: ls  space  minus minus all and press Enter."""
This shows all the files including the hidden files (hidden files here are filenames starting with dot (.))
If we not only want to see the file but also get more information we can use the 'minus l' option.
Just type the command: ls space minus small l and press Enter.
ls can be used with many options which we will see later.
Just type the command followed by the right angle bracket and the file name. Say we write ls space minus small l space right angle bracket space fileinfo and press Enter.
Now all the files and directories information will be directed into the file named 'fileinfo'.
"""But how do we see the content of this file? For this, we have the cat command. Just type cat space and the name of the file, here it is fileinfo and press Enter."""
"""Now you can see its contents. In fact, the other main use of cat is to create a file. For this, type at the prompt: cat space right angle bracket space filename say file1 and press Enter."""
Now when we press Enter the command waits for input from the user.
Whatever we type would be written into the file so type some text.
Now press Enter key to indicate the end of input.
Now press the Ctrl and D keys together.
If a file by name say 'file1' already exists then the user input will be overwritten on this file.
Now if you wish to append to the end of an existing file ‘file1’ type at the prompt: cat space double right angle bracket space file1 and press Enter.
"""There are several other commands that we could have discussed but we would keep it to this for now. In fact, even for all the commands discussed there are many options and possibilities untouched here."""
"""This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial. Spoken Tutorials are a part of the Talk to a Teacher project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Categories in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Course category, how to create categories & subcategories, how to perform actions on categories."""
"""To record this tutorial, I will be using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04, Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30, Moodle 3.3 and Firefox web browser."""
You can use any web browser of your choice.
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
Learners of this tutorial should have Moodle 3.3 installed on their system.
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and open your 'Moodle' homepage. Make sure that the XAMPP service is running.
Login with your admin username and password details.
"""On the left side, click on Site Administration."""
Click on the Courses tab and then Manage courses and categories.
We will be directed to a page with the title Course and category management. Let us understand what a course category is.
Course categories help to organize Moodle courses for the site users.
The default category for a new Moodle site is Miscellaneous.
"""Any new course will be assigned to this Miscellaneous category, by default."""
"""However, it will be difficult for teachers and students to find their courses."""
"""To make it easier to locate courses, they should be assigned in categories."""
Most institutions organize courses by campus or department.
It is good to have descriptive names for better clarity.
We will go ahead and organize our courses by departments. For eg. our Maths category will have all the Math courses.
Let us switch back to the Moodle site.
First we will understand the Course and category management page layout.
"""On the left, we have the Navigation block. And on the right, we have the Content region."""
"""The content region is divided into 2 columns: left column shows the course categories,  right column shows all the courses under the selected category."""
"""By default, it is showing courses under Miscellaneous category."""
This view can be changed from the menu located at the right.
Click on the down arrow to see the options.
Now click on Course categories. This changes the view to show only the course categories.
Let us click on the arrow again and change the view to see only the courses. Click on Courses.
Notice that a new drop-down box has appeared now. This is the category drop-down.
"""Here, we can select the category for which we want to show the courses. Currently, it only has the Miscellaneous category."""
Let us change the view back to Course categories and courses.
Now we will click on Create new category link to add a category.
Click on the Parent category dropdown box and select Top. Type: Mathematics in the Category name.
Category ID number is an optional field. This is for admin users to identify the course with offline courses.
"""If your college uses ID for categories, you can use that category ID here. This field is not visible to other Moodle users."""
"""For now, I will leave Category ID as blank."""
"""In the Description textbox, I will type- “All mathematics courses will be listed under this category.”"""
Then click on Create category button.
We are now in the Course categories and courses view.
Here we can see 2 categories now: Miscellaneous and Mathematics.
Let us organize these categories further.  Let us have separate 1st year Maths courses and 2nd year Maths courses.
"""For this, we will create a subcategory called 1st Year Maths, inside the Mathematics category."""
Click on Create new category link at the top of the listed categories.
Creation of the subcategory is same as that of a category.
Don’t select Top as the parent category.
"""Instead, select the category under which this subcategory should belong."""
"""So here, we will type: 1st Year Maths in the category name."""
"""After that, we’ll type a Description and click on Create category button."""
Notice that the categories on the left are listed in a tree format.
A category which has subcategories has a toggle icon to expand and collapse it.
Notice 3 icons on the right of the category.
Hover over the icons to see what they are.
The eye is for hiding the category.
A hidden category will have the eye crossed to indicate the same.
"""The arrow is for moving the category up or down. It also has a settings gear icon which is a menu, as shown by the down arrow."""
"""Click on the settings gear icon for Miscellaneous category.  It has options such as Edit, Create new subcategory, Delete etc. related to the category."""
Click elsewhere on the page to close this menu.
Let me collapse the navigation menu on the left for better view.
"""Next, click on the settings gear icon for Mathematics category."""
Notice that there are 4 extra submenus here related to sorting of the subcategories.
All categories that have subcategories will have these menu items.
The number to the right of the gear icon indicates the number of courses in that category.
There are sorting options below the list of categories.
"""At the end, is the option to change the parent category of a subcategory."""
"""To use this option, you have to check the check-box next to the subcategory you want to move."""
Then select the new parent category and click on Move.  We will not use this option right now.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: Course category, how to create categories & subcategories,  how to perform actions on categories."""
Here is an assignment for you: Add a new subcategory 2nd Year Maths under Mathematics. Delete the category Miscellaneous.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Setup in FrontAccounting.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn: FrontAccounting interface"""
Various modules in the Setup tab
"""Also, we will learn how to: Create our own organization or Company"""
Setup user accounts
Setup access permissions and Setup display
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04"""
FrontAccounting version 2.4.7
To follow this tutorial you should have Knowledge of higher secondary commerce and Knowledge of Accounting.
Start the XAMPP services before you begin working on FrontAccounting interface.
Let us open the FrontAccounting interface.
Open the browser and type localhost slash account and press Enter.
The login page appears.
"""Recall that during installation, we had created the admin user."""
Type the username as admin and password as spoken.
Then click on the Login button.
The FrontAccounting window opens.
Standard modules have been provided in FrontAccounting.
We will learn about Sales Purchases
Items and Inventory
Banking and General Ledger and Setup  modules in the upcoming tutorials.
Let us start with the Setup tab in FrontAccounting.
Click on the Setup tab. This module is used for Company Setting.
Let us create a new organisation or Company by clicking on the Company Setup link.
"""In the Name field, by default, we can see the name of the company - 'ST Company Pvt Ltd'."""
This is because we had given this name during installation.
"""However, you can change the name based on how you want it to appear in the reports."""
I will keep the same name. Scroll down.
"""In the Home currency field, click on the dropdown menu."""
A list of options will appear.
But Indian Rupees is not available in the list.
"""Since our company is in India, we will setup the home currency to Indian Rupees."""
Let us learn how to add a new currency to the list here.
Click on the Banking and General Ledger tab in the top menu.
"""In the Maintenance panel, click on Currencies link. A new window appears."""
Type 'INR' in the Currency Abbreviation field and 'Rs' in the Currency Symbol field.
"""In the Currency Name field, type 'Indian Rupees'."""
"""In the Hundredths Name field, type ‘Paise’ and in the Country field type 'India'."""
Now click on 'Add new' button at the bottom of the window.
We can see a success message- 'New currency has been added'.
"""Let us go back to the Company setup page. For this, click on the Setup tab in the top menu and then on Company Setup link."""
"""Next, type the Company’s address,"""
"""Domicile ,  Phone no, Email address and Company GST number in the respective fields as shown here."""
"""Now, click on the Home Currency drop-down box."""
Select ' Indian Rupees'.
Next we will learn about fiscal year.
"""By default the previous financial year, i,e 1st January to 31st December 2018 is shown as closed."""
"""At the time of recording this tutorial, the date is as shown on the screen."""
It may differ when you are practicing.
Note that the date format is in MMDDYYYY.
What is Fiscal year?
It is a period that a Company uses for accounting purposes and preparing financial statements. It varies across countries.
"""Fiscal Year setup When a new Company is created in FrontAccounting, the Fiscal Year has to be set up correctly."""
"""By default, FrontAccounting software shows the fiscal year from January to December"""
This is not suitable for Companies and organisations in India.
We have to set up the fiscal year from 1st April to 31st March for that financial year.
This is as per Indian Accounting Standards.
Let us switch back to the FrontAccounting interface.
Scroll down and click on the Update button to save the entries.
We can see a message- Company setup has been updated.
"""Now, we will change the Fiscal Year to the current Financial Year."""
Click on the Setup tab of FrontAccounting.
Click on the Fiscal Years link.
"""We can see that, by default the Fiscal Year begins from 01 January 2018 to 31 December 2018."""
"""So first, we will create a dummy period for 3 months from 01 January 2019 to 31 March 2019."""
Why dummy period?  This is because we have to fill the gap between the Fiscal year ie.1st January to 31st December and the Financial year which is from 1st April to 31st March
You may be in a different financial year when you are practising this tutorial.
"""In that case, you have to set up the fiscal year for all the previous years upto the current financial year."""
A sample is shown here for your understanding.
"""First, select the 3 months dummy period from 01 January 2019 to 31 March 2019."""
"""Now, click on the Add New button."""
We can see the dummy period is created.
A message appears - “New Fiscal year has been added”.
"""Then, we can see the current financial year is from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020."""
Keep the “Is closed” option to “No” as we will be using the current financial year for accounting purposes.
"""Again, click on the Add new button."""
"""Here, you can see the Financial Year has been created."""
We can see the fiscal year from 1st January 2018 to 31st December 2018 as closed.
We have created the dummy period from 1st January 2019 to 31st March 2019.
We will change the Is Closed option to Yes. Click on Edit icon.
"""In the Is Closed drop down menu, select Yes."""
Repeat the same steps to close all the previous financial years if they are not required.
Click on Update button.
A message appears - “Selected fiscal year has been updated”
Likewise you can use the Edit button to make changes.
"""The cross (X) sign is for deleting the year. Right now, we will not delete any rows."""
"""Now, we need to update these changes in the Company setup."""
Click on the Setup tab. Then click on the Company Setup link.
"""In the Fiscal year field, click on the drop-down menu."""
Select the current Financial Year as 1st April 2019 to 31st March 2020 which is shown as active.
Scroll down and go to Login Timeout option.
We will increase to 6 lakh seconds so that frequent logout or timeout can be avoided.
Click on the Update button.
Next we will setup User Accounts.
Again click on the Setup tab.
Click on the User Accounts Setup link.
"""We can see the admin user login information such as Full Name  ,  Email ,  Access Level, etc."""
Recall this information was entered during the installation. Let us create a new user login.
"""I have typed the new user details as shown here. Likewise, enter your new user details."""
"""In Access Level field, click on the drop-down menu and select Sub Admin."""
"""In the Language field, by default, the drop-down menu option is English."""
"""Here, POS means Point of Sale. We will keep the Default option."""
"""In Printing option drop-down menu, keep the default option Browser printing support."""
"""Next, by default, the checkbox is checked for popup window for the reports option."""
Click on the Add new button. We can see the message- ‘A new user has been added’.
We can also see that the new user is added in the panel below the admin.
"""Again, click on the Setup tab."""
"""Next, let us see Access setup."""
Click on the Role drop-down menu and select Sub Admin.
We can see the default access given for a Sub Admin to use. Scroll down.
We can see the permissions available for the Sub Admin.
You can also check or uncheck the boxes as required for the Sub Admin to use.
Then click on Save Role button.
A message appears as “Security role has been updated”.
"""Likewise, you can create several users as per your requirement and give the required permissions."""
"""Again, click on the Setup tab and then on Display Setup link."""
"""Display Setup is used to change the Decimal Places, Date format and Separators  and other parameters."""
"""We can see the number of Decimal Places for Prices/amounts ,  Quantities ,  Exchange rate and  Percentages"""
We can change the Date format and Date Separators by selecting the drop-down menu.
We will change the Date format to DDMMYYYY.
We can see various Miscellaneous Settings also.
Click on the Update button to save the changes.
We can see a message “Display settings have been updated”.
Now we will check the fiscal year date format. Go to the Setup tab.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on  Servlet Methods.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:"""
create a simple login form using JSP
Pass parameters using doGet method
Pass parameters using doPost method
Difference between doGet and doPost methods.
Here we are using:Ubuntu Version 12.04
Firefox web-browser 21.0.
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know:"""
Core Java using Netbeans IDE
HTML
Basics of Java Servlets and JSPs.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website."""
We will begin by creating our web application- the Library Management System.
"""First, we will create the Home page."""
The Home page will contain a simple login form.
It will allow authenticated users to login to the Library Management System.
"""Now, let us switch to Netbeans IDE."""
Let us go to the index  dot jsp page that we had already modified earlier.
I have modified this page to create our home page.
We keep the title as Home Page.
"""Inside the body, we have a table with border equal to  1."""
You can have a look at the code here.
"""Inside the table, we have included a heading Welcome to Library Management System."""
"""Next, we have a paragraph tag that includes  """"This is the home page for Library Management System""""."""
Then we have a hyperlink which links to a page called visitorHomePage dot jsp.
We will create this page later.
"""Next, we have a very simple login form."""
This form allows a registered user to login .
"""Before creating the form , you will have to create a servlet named GreetingServlet."""
"""So, pause the tutorial here and create a new servlet as explained in the earlier tutorial."""
Note that the servlet name is GreetingServletand
the URL pattern should be GreetingServletPath.
This form has two input elements - Username and Password.
It also has a Submit button that says Sign In.
"""Next, we have a paragraph tag that includes a link to addUser.jsp."""
This is the registration page for those users who have not yet registered.
"""Now, let us go to our GreetingServlet.java."""
Note that GreetingServlet.java is created in the same package org.spokentutorial.
"""Now, this servlet will be able to access the form data from the request object."""
This servlet will act as a controller.
Do you recall that we had come across controller earlier?
"""Now, we will see what the servlet does as a controller."""
The form data will reside in the request object.
The first task is to retrieve the form data parameters.
This is done using the getParameter method on the request object.
"""So, let us switch to Netbeans IDE."""
Type inside the doGet method:
PrintWriter space out equal to response dot getWriter().
"""Next, we will retrieve the form data parameters."""
"""So that on the next line, type:"""
String space username equal to request  dot getParameter  within brackets and double quotes userName and semicolon.
Note that this userName is the name we have included in the form tag for User Name.
"""Similarly, we will retrieve the password also."""
"""So, on the next line, type: String  space password equal to request dot getParameter  within brackets and double quotes password semicolon."""
"""Next, we will print the UserName in the output."""
"""So, on the next line, type:"""
out dot println within brackets and double quotes  Hello from GET Method plus username.
"""Now, to run this project, right-click on MyFirstProject."""
Click on Clean and Build.
"""Again right-click on MyFirstProject ,  click on Run."""
"""So, the server is up and running."""
It has deployed MyFirstProject.
We have got our Home page displayed in the browser.
Observe that the title of the page is Home Page.
We can see a very simple login form here.
Let me enter the Username and Password.
I will type arya as the Username.
And arya*123 as the Password.
We can see that we have got the output Hello from GET Method arya.
"""Now, the user was able to login here because we have not included any validation inside the code."""
We will do this in the later tutorial.
"""Now, have a look at the URL here."""
It is localhost  colon 8080  slash MyFirstProject  slash  GreetingServletPath  question mark  userName  equal to  arya and password  equal to  arya *123.
"""Now, the form data is separated from the page information by a question mark."""
We can see that the username and password that we had entered in the form are inside the URL also.
"""Now let us try to do the same, using POST Method."""
"""So, switch back to the IDE."""
Copy the code we had written for  doGet method and paste in the doPost method.
"""Now, change the println statement to Hello from POST Method."""
"""Now, let us open index dot jsp."""
"""Here, we must change the method attribute of the form tag to POST."""
You can have a look at this code now.
We have form action  equal to  GreetingServletPath method  equal to  POST.
"""Now, we will run this Project again."""
"""So, right-click on MyFirstProject and click on Run."""
We have got the output similar to the one we got when we used the GET method.
"""So, let us type  UserName and Password again."""
Then click on Sign In.
Note that we have got Hello from POST Method arya.
"""Now, take a look at the URL."""
It is localhost colon 8080 slash MyFirstProject slash GreetingServlet Path.
"""Here, we do not see the form data in the URL of the request."""
This is the major difference between doGet and doPost methods.
"""Now, let us learn when to use GET and when to use POST methods."""
GET method is used when:
the form is small and hence the data is less.
the user wants the contents of the data to be visible in the URL.
POST method is used when:
the form is large and hence the data is more.
the user does not want the contents of the data to be visible in the URL.
ex: passwords
Let us summarize.
In this tutorial we have learnt to:
create a simple login form using JSP
Difference between doGet and doPost methods.

"""Welcome to  Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""Here is the Foreground and Background Colour dialog, you can select the colours in 6 different ways."""
"""Here, I select black as my Foreground colour and you can see that the value of Hue, Saturation, Value, Red, Green, Blue all are zero."""
And when I increase the value of Hue nothing changes.
"""Black remains black because the value is zero and when I increase the value, I get  different gray tones."""
I can increase the Saturation while value is zero and nothing changes.
"""But you can see here that when I increase the Saturation, the colour in the other sliders changes a bit."""
"""If I pull the Hue, nothing happens  but when I pull Saturation, colour of Value changes to a kind of blue."""
If you want to select a colour by the 'HSV' system then just pull the Saturation and Value sliders up and you get different colours of the rainbow in the Hue slider and you can select from these colours.
"""Here you can see the colours in the Red, Green and Blue sliders change according to 'HSV' sliders and it becomes easy to select a colour."""
"""If you want a light colour then adjust the Saturation slider and if you want a good mixture of strong colours then slide the Value slider accordingly and select an amount in Red, Green or Blue slider."""
"""So Hue, Saturation and Value is not very easy to understand but a good way to select colours."""
I use this dialog only when I have to set a specific colour.
"""For example, if I want to have exactly medium gray then I pull the Value slider up to 50, so the value is divided between 0% & 100% and in the 'RGB' slider I set the numbers to 127  and you get exactly mediu"
"""Now, let's have a look at the other dialogs."""
This dialog is based on the 'HSV' colour model and first you select the colour in the circle which you want to have.
And then select the Value and the Saturation in the triangle.
"""So, when a Hue is selected, you get here the different values of  Value and Saturation in the triangle for the same Hue."""
The next dialog is similar to this one here.
"""In this dialog, you have a strip to select the Hue and you get the same colour as in the triangle in this square. And now you can select your colour here, from this area or you can change the Hue here and se"
Here you can also switch to Saturation.
"""And, select the combination of Value by sliding this way and Hue sliding this way."""
You can set the Value to get a strong colour here and change the Saturation and the Hue accordingly.
"""In the same manner, it works for Red, Green & Blue."""
I can change the amount of Blue in the colours I want to have and then the amount of Red and Green in the same way.
This dialog is not so innovative than the previous one.
The next dialog is a water colour mixup.
"""Here, this slider adjusts the intensity of tipping into the colour pots."""
And you can select a colour from this box.
"""And this, here, will be the resulting colour."""
"""You can select a colour, let's say this yellow and now I can add a bit of blue to this and a bit of red and the resulting colour you get is very muddy."""
I don't use this dialog very often.
This dialog shows the active pallet and you can set the pallet somewhere else.
It’s only useful for graphic designing and  for web designing. I really never have done much with this dialog.
"""One more thing is still to cover, it's the printer colours  here."""
"""I think this dialog is useful only for professional printers and printers use Cyan, Magenta and Yellow instead of Red, Green and Blue and that is because they substract the colours."""
"""The Red, Green and Blue mix up and add to white and with printing if I set Cyan, Magenta and Yellow to zero, simply the white paper is printed."""
"""If I want to print the black colour then I can set Cyan, Meganta & Yellow to 100 and I get fully black paper."""
"""These colours, these dyes substract from light, and reflect only Cyan."""
"""And by mixing them up, you can substract more and more from the light and you can get all the colours you can print."""
There are some visible colours that cannot be printed and so your result varies.
The fourth slider is K which represents black.
"""To avoid mismatch with blue, it is set as 'K' for Black."""
"""When I click the white colour which is my background colour, you can see nothing has changed."""
The colours are the same but the Cyan slider has gone down and the K slider has gone up.
Let's repeat that.
"""Slide  the Y slider to 40, M to 80 and C to 20."""
"""Now when I select the colour you get the M slider as 75, Y as 26 and K as 20."""
"""So you can see that the colour hasn’t changed but the mixture of cyan, magenta and yellow that was there before in the image has changed to magenta, yellow and black."""
"""Black ink is a bit cheaper. So, for the static point here, instead of the macky mixture of cyan, magenta and yellow, mixture of Magenta, Yellow and Black is used."""
"""So, now we have covered all the six dialogs of colour selection."""
"""But, these two colour swaps are remaining."""
"""The front colour is my foreground colour and the other one is my background colour and when I click on it, you can set the colour here."""
"""And, if you want these colours in your image or in your selection then just pull these colours over that area and it gets filled with that colour."""
You can have these colour swaps in the tool box.
"""Just go to File, Preferences and then Toolbox and here you can see foreground background colour and even the brush and the active image."""
I'll switch this off afterwards because it takes too much space in my tool box.
This small icon on right top corner of colour swaps is for exchanging the foreground and background colour.
The same can be done by pressing the 'X' key.
This icon on bottom left corner is for setting foreground and background colour to black and white.
This is a nice new feature. Its a colour picker and you can choose any colour you want from your screen or even  from a web site.
"""And, lastly there is a field where you can see the Hex code to define colours."""
"""And, when I change the colour you can see how the code changes and I can also type in the Hex code and get the colour or you can even type the colour name."""
"""For example, I type 'L' and you get all the colours lawn green, this is lawn green. So this was colour dialog in detail."""
I think I talked way too much.
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Welcome to the  tutorial on Arithmetic Operations in Java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn about the various Arithmetic Operators namely Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division and  How to use them."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have eclipse installed on your system"""
"""and you must know how to create, save and run a file in Eclipse."""
Here is a list of operators and the mathematical operations they perform plus (+) symbol for addition minus (-) for subtraction asterisk (*) for multiplication and slash (/) for division
We shall look at each of them in detail.
Here we have the 'Eclipse IDE' and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
We have created a class by name ArithmeticOperations and added the main method.
Let us add some variables.
int x = 5;
int y = 10; int result;
'x' and 'y' will be operands  and the  result will store the output of the operations.
Let us add them and print the result. result= x+y; system. out. println in parentheses result.
Save it with Control S and control F11 to Run.
We see that the output of the addition has been stored in result and the value has been printed.
"""Now Let us change the values. x=75, y = 15;"""
"""Save it, Run."""
we see that the output has changed  accordingly.
"""Now, let us try negative values. y = -25;"""
"""Save, Run."""
we see  that the output of  75  plus  -25 has been printed.
Now let us try subtraction. y = 5 and change x+y to x-y.
"""Save it, Run."""
we see that the output of 75-5 has been printed.
Now Let us try  multiplication. Change minus to asterisk (*).
Save and Run.
we see that  by using asterisk (*) we could  multiply 75 by 5.
Now let us try division. Remove  asterisk (*) and type slash.
"""As we can see, the output is as expected."""
Now let us see what happens when the expected result is a decimal point number.
Change 5 to 10
The result must be 7.5
"""So, let us change the result to a   float."""
"""Note that although the expected result is 7.5, we get output 7.0 ."""
This is because both the operands involved in the division are integers.
Let us change 'y' to a float. y = 10f;
"""Save, Run."""
Now we can see that the result is as expected.
"""Keep in mind that when the expected result is a float, one of the operands must be a float to get the expected output."""
Now let us see what happens when there is more than one operator. Remove all the operands.
"""int result= 8+4-2; Save it, Run."""
"""As we can see, the output is as expected."""
Now change minus to a slash.
Now the output could be 6 if the addition is done before division.
Or it could be 10 if the division is done before addition.
Let us Run and see the output.
"""As we can see, the output is 10 and   the division is done before addition. This is because the division operator has more precedence than the addition operator."""
"""In such situations, if we need to override the precedence, we use parentheses."""
"""By adding parentheses, we instruct Java to do the addition before the division."""
Let us run the file now.
"""As we can see, addition has been performed first and the output is 6, as expected."""
"""As a rule, keep in mind to use parentheses when the order of operations is not clear."""
This brings us  to the end of this tutorial.
We have learnt: How to perform basic mathematical operations in Java.
operator precedence and How to override it.
As an assignment for this tutorial: find out what is meant by the modulo operator and what it does.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Creating a Java web project.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
to create a Java Web Project
About Deployment Descriptor
About web.xml file.
Here we are using:Ubuntu version 12.04
Firefox web-browser 21.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of:"""
Core Java using Netbeans IDE and
HTML.
"""Now, let us see how to create a simple Java web project using NetBeans IDE."""
"""For this, we will switch to NetBeans IDE."""
"""On the top left corner of the IDE,  click on File and  click on New Project."""
A New Project window opens up.
"""From the Categories, choose Java Web and from the Projects choose Web Application."""
Then click on Next.
"""On the next window that opens,"""
type the Project Name as MyFirstProject.
Leave the Project location and Project Folder as it is.
"""Then, click on Next."""
Select GlassFish Server as the  Server.
"""Note that Context Path here is MyFirstProject,  this is the same name as our Project."""
We will learn about this in detail.
"""Now, click on Next and then click on Finish."""
Click on the  Projects tab.
"""We can see, there are several nodes here and a web application named My First Project has been created."""
"""Now, we are not concerned about all of these nodes right now."""
"""But let me click and show you, what it contains."""
"""Now, let us learn about what is known as  Deployment Descriptor."""
A web application’s deployment descriptor describes
"""the classes, resources and configuration of the application and"""
how the web server uses them to serve web requests.
The web server receives a request for the application.
It uses deployment descriptor to map the URL of the request.
It maps the URL to the code that has to handle the request.
The deployment descriptor is a file named web.xml.
"""Now, let us come back to the IDE."""
We are not able to find the web.xml file from the nodes available here.
"""To locate it, at the top left of the IDE, click on File and then click on New File."""
"""From the Categories, choose Web."""
"""And from the File Types,  choose  Standard Deployment Descriptor (web.xml)."""
Then click on Next
and click on Finish.
Click on the Files tab on the left hand  side of the IDE.
Note that web.xml is visible under the WEB-INF folder of the 'Web' node.
You can see the source-code now.
We have an xml header here.
We also have a web-app node.
"""Now, we shall try running the application."""
"""To do so, right click on MyFirstProject."""
This will delete any previously compiled files and other build outputs.
It will also recompile the application.
"""Again, right click on MyFirstProject and then click on Run."""
"""So, the server is up and running and it has deployed My first Project."""
A browser window opens up and displays  Hello World .
"""This is because when we run the project, the web application renders the page shown."""
"""Now, let’s have a look at the URL  here that rendered the page."""
It is localhost  colon 8080 slash MyFirstProject.
"""So, when we run MyFirstProject, by default we get a JSP page that says HelloWorld!"""
"""Now, let us come back to our IDE."""
"""We can see that under the WEB-INF folder, there is index.jsp."""
Double click on index.jsp.
We can see the source code here.
It is a simple JSP page with HTML tags only.
"""It has the title """"JSP Page"""" and it has the heading """"Hello World""""."""
The server provides index.jsp by default when we run the web application.
Recall that we had come across something called ContextPath earlier.
We had set the ContextPath as MyFirstProject itself.
"""Now, come back to the browser."""
Type the  URL  as localhost colon 8080 and press Enter.
We see the Home page of Glassfish Server is displayed.
"""Here, 8080 is the default port at which the server runs on the machine."""
This Glassfish Server instance may have many applications running on it.
"""To access a particular application, type that application-name in the URL."""
"""So, we must type the specific application that has been deployed on that instance."""
"""So, we will type  slash MyFirstProject ."""
"""And press Enter. So, we see Hello World! displayed."""

Warm greetings! Welcome to this tutorial on Stereoisomerism.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Conformational isomerism, Geometrical isomerism andR-S configurations with examples."""
"""Here, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS version. 14.04, Avogadro version 1.1.1."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with Avogadro interface. If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website."""
Example files used in this tutorial are provided as code files.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to build stereoisomers using Avogadro."""
I will give a brief introduction about stereoiosmersism.
Stereoisomersism arises due to difference in spatial arrangement of atoms.
Isomers have same structure and hence do not differ much in properties.
Here is a slide that shows classification of isomers.
I will begin with Conformational isomerism.
It is a form of stereoisomerism.
"""In this, isomers can be inter-converted by rotation about single bonds."""
Rotation about single bond is restricted by rotational energy barrier.
"""Let's begin with conformers of 1,2-dichloroethane."""
"""1,2-dichloroethane exists in three conformers namely: Eclipsed, Gauche and Anti."""
I have opened Avogadro window.
Click on Draw tool.
Uncheck Adjust Hydrogens check box.
Click on the panel and drag to draw two atoms.
Select Chlorine from Element drop down.
Draw a bond on each carbon.
Go to Build menu and click on Add Hydrogens.
"""1,2-dichloroethane is drawn on the Panel."""
Let's optimize the structure.
Click on Auto Optimization tool.
"""In the Force Field, select MMFF94 and click on Start button."""
Click on Stop to stop the optimization process.
Cick on Navigation tool to rotate the structure for proper orientation.
We have Gauche conformer on the panel.
"""To show conformers of 1,2-dichloroethane, I will fix the plane of rotation."""
Click on Bond Centric Manipulation tool.
Click on the bond between two carbon atoms.
Plane between the atoms appears in blue or yellow  color.
Place the cursor on Chlorine atom.
Rotate the bond in clock-wise direction.
Click on Navigation tool and rotate the structure.
We have  Anti conformer on the panel.
Again use Bondcentric Manipulation tool to rotate the C-C bond.
We have Eclipsed conformer on the Panel.
"""Now, I will show various conformers of Cyclohexane."""
Open a new window.
"""In Draw settings menu, Carbon is selected as default element."""
Uncheck Adjust Hydrogens check box.
Let's draw cyclohexane structure in the boat form.
Click and drag to draw boat conformer of cyclohexane on the Panel.
"""To label the atoms, click on Label check box in the Display Types menu."""
Please note labeling may not be same all the time.
Let us label the conformers as per our requirement.
"""Click on Selection tool, then right-click on first carbon atom."""
A menu opens. Select Change label.
Change label of the atom text box opens.
"""In the New Label field, type 1 and click OK."""
Next right-click on the second atom and change the label as 2.
"""Similarly, I will change the labels of atoms as 3, 4, 5 and 6."""
We will convert boat to twist boat conformer.
Click on Manipulation Tool. Click on 2 and drag it upwards.
Click on 5 and drag it upwards. Click on 3 and drag it upwards.
We have twist boat on the Panel.
"""Now, we will convert twist boat to half chair conformer."""
Click on 2 and drag it downwards.
Click on 5 and drag it downwards.
Click on 4 and drag it to horizontal position.
"""Adjust the positions of all carbon atoms if required, to get correct structure."""
We have half chair on the Panel.
Now we will convert half chair  to chair conformer.
Click on 4 and drag it downwards.
Click on 1 and drag it downwards.
"""Adjust the positions of all carbon atoms if required, to get correct structure."""
We have chair conformer on the Panel.
"""As an assignment,  draw various  conformers of Butane and Cyclopentane."""
Now I will draw structures to demonstrate geometrical isomerism.
Geometrical isomerism arises due to different spatial arrangement of atoms around a double-bond.
"""Here, rotation of atoms or groups around double-bonded carbon is restricted."""
"""For demonstration, I will draw  diamminedichloroplatinum(II) structure also known as cisplatin."""
Open a new window.
"""In Draw settings menu, click on Element drop down and select Other. Periodic table window opens."""
Select Platinum(Pt) from the table. Close the Periodic table window.
"""From Element drop down, select Chlorine."""
Draw two chlorine bonds on Platinum atom on the same side.
Select Nitrogen from Element drop down. Draw two nitrogen bonds as before.
"""To complete the structure, we need three attached hydrogens on nitrogen atoms."""
Select Hydrogen from Element drop down.
Click on each nitrogen atom to draw the third bond.
Let's optimize the structure.
Click on Auto Optimization tool.
"""In the Force Field, select UFF and click on Start button."""
Click on Stop to stop the optimization process.
"""For demonstration, I will require two structures."""
I will copy and paste the structures.
Click on Selection tool to select the structure.
Press CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste. Drag the pasted structure to right.
"""For convenience, I will label the atoms."""
Click on Label check box in the Display Types menu.
"""To remove Hydrogens, go to Build menu and select Remove Hydrogens."""
We have two isomers of cisplatin on the Panel.
I will convert the second cis isomer to trans isomer.
Click on Manipulation tool.
Click and drag Cl4 to  left. Click and drag N4 to right.
Then adjust the postions of all the bonds to show proper orientation.
Go to Build menu and select Add Hydrogens.
"""As before, each nitrogen has two atoms attached."""
Add the third Hydrogen using Hydrogen from Draw tool.
Let's optimize the structures.
"""In the Force Field, select UFF and click on Start button."""
Click on Stop to stop the optimization process.
We now have two geometrical isomers of diamminedichloroplatinum(II) on the Panel.
"""Similarly, we have the geometrical isomers of diamminetetracyanoferrate(III)ion [Fe(NH3</sub)2(CN)4]-."""
Next we will discuss about  R-S configuration.
R-S configurations arise due to the presence of a Chiral centre.
Chiral centre is an atom connected to four different substituents.
Configurations are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.
"""For demonstration of  R-S configurations, I will use amino acid - Alanine."""
I will load Alanine structure from Fragment library.
All the amino acids available in the Fragment library are optically active.
You can load and explore on your own.
Press CTRL+SHIFT and A to deselect the structure.
"""Using the Navigation tool, rotate the structure for proper orientation."""
"""Central carbon atom is chiral, attached to 4 different groups."""
R S configuration is based on priority given to the substituent in clockwise or anticlockwise direction.
Priority is based on atomic number of the substituent.
Substituent with higher atomic number gets first priority.
Now we see the priority in clockwise direction.
"""In this structure, nitrogen is given first priority."""
Carbon attached with oxygens is given second priority. And methyl is given third priority.
Structure has R configuration.
I will change the positions of the attached groups to the chiral carbon.
Go to Build menu and select Remove Hydrogens.
Move carbon to right side.
Move carbon attached to oxygens to left.
Go to Build menu and select Add Hydrogens.
Now we will see the priority in anti-clockwise direction.
Nitrogen has first priority. Carbon attached with oxygen is given second priority. And Methyl is given third priority.
Structure has S configuration.
"""Similarly, we have R and S configurations of Glyceraldehyde on the Panel."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt to draw: Conformations of 1,2-dichloroethane, Conformations of cyclohexane, Geometrical isomers of cisplatin, R-S configurations of amino acid Alanine."""
"""As an assignment, draw Geometrical isomers of 2-butene and 1,2-dichloroethene,  R-S configurations of bromochloroiodomethane."""

Now you should be able to see a screen like this.
"""Notice the columns Roles, Groups and Enrolment Methods have icons."""
Move your mouse over each of the icons to understand their functions.
Note that: An enrolled student can belong to more than one group as well.
Let us now see how we can send a message to the students.
Click on Participants link in the left navigation bar.
This will show the list of all enrolled users with their assigned roles in the course.
"""By default, Moodle Participants page displays only 20 students."""
You will need to click on Show all if you have more than 20 students to see all the students. The link is not visible right now because I don’t have more than 20 students.
There are some filters seen above the list of users. Use them to help select the right set of users.
I will select Student in the Current role dropdown.
This will filter the list to show only the users who have student role assigned to them.
Click on Select all button at the bottom of the page to select all the students.
Then select Send a message in With selected users dropdown.
This will send a common message to all the selected students.
Pause the tutorial and type the message as shown here in the Message body.
"""Then at the bottom, click on the Preview button, to preview the message before sending."""
"""You can also update the message, if required, by clicking on the Update button."""
"""To send the message, click on the Send message button."""

Select Add a new note from the With selected users dropdown.
"""In the Content text area of one user, I will type the note as shown."""
"""In the Content text area next to another user, I will type the note as shown here."""
Look at the Context dropdown to the right.
The Context of a note determines which users can see the note.
A personal note will be seen only by the teacher and the student being sent to.
A course note will be visible to the other teachers of this course.
A site note will be visible to all teachers in all courses.
Most institutions have their own rules regarding communication between teachers and students.
You can decide the Context based on these guidelines.
I will let the Context be course.
Click on Save changes button when done.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Banking and General Ledger in Front Accounting.
"""In this tutorial,we will learn to create General Ledger Classes"""
General Ledger Groups  and General Ledger Accounts
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04"""
FrontAccounting version 2.4.7
"""To practise this tutorial, you must have knowledge of: Higher secondary commerce and accounting ,  Principles of Bookkeeping"""
And you should have already set up an organisation or Company in FrontAccounting.
"""If not, for relevant FrontAccounting tutorials please visit this website."""
Start the XAMPP services before you begin working on FrontAccounting interface.
Let us open the FrontAccounting interface.
Open the browser and type localhost slash account and press Enter.
The login page appears.
Type the username as admin and the password. Then click on Login button.
The FrontAccounting interface opens.
Click on Banking and General Ledger tab.
In the Maintenance panel we can see the options: GL Accounts
GL Account Groups and GL Account Classes
"""Before we start with any transaction, we need to set the Charts of Accounts."""
"""The Charts of Accounts in FrontAccounting is defined by Type, Class, Group and Account."""
"""All transactions are charged to an Account, Group and Classes."""
These are used to group transactions for reporting purposes.
"""In FrontAccounting, Account belongs to a Group and Group belongs to a Class"""
It will be reflected in the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss account statements as per the Account Group.
Switch back to the FrontAccounting interface.
The first step is to set the General Ledger Account Classes.
Click on GL Account Classes link in the Maintenance panel.
"""Here, by default the Class Name and Class Type are defined as: Assets ,  Liabilities ,  Income and Expense"""
"""Also, we can see that the Class ID is set for each Class Type."""
We need to set this class before setting the Account Group.
Now we will see how to add a new class.
"""In the Class ID field, type 5. The Class ID should be a unique value."""
"""In the Class Name field, type Equity."""
"""Click on the Class Type drop-down box. We can see the default list: Assets ,  Liabilities, Equity, Income, Cost of Goods Sold and  Expense"""
FrontAccounting follows this Class Type to present in the Balance Sheet.
Select the Class Type as Equity.
Click on Add new button at the bottom of the window.
A message is displayed- 'New account class has been added'.
"""Here, we can see that the new Class “Equity” has been added to the third row."""
"""This is because, in the default Class Type, Equity is on the third hierarchy level."""
"""So, whenever a new Class is added, it takes the default place of that Class Type."""
"""Now, let us see how to add GL Groups."""
Go to the Banking and General Ledger tab.
Click on the GL Account Groups link in the Maintenance panel.
"""We can see the default Group Name, which shows GL Account Groups under the Class."""
You can also see the Group ID is set according to the Class.
"""In the ID field, type the new Group ID as 12."""
"""In the Name field, I will type Fixed Assets as the Group Name."""
The Group Name “Fixed Assets” does not belong to any subgroup that is already available.
"""Hence, in the Subgroup field, keep the field as None."""
"""Now, click on the Class drop-down box."""
"""According to the Charts of Accounts, Fixed Assets comes under the class of Assets. So select Class as Assets."""
"""To save these changes, click on Add new button at the bottom of the window."""
"""We can see an error message that says - """"This account Group ID is already in use""""."""
So a unique Class ID has to be added to each Group Name.
Let’s change the Group ID to 13.
Click on the Add new button at the bottom of the window.
"""This time we can see a message that says - """"New account type has been added."""""""
The new Group Name is added randomly within the class “Assets”.
"""Likewise, we can add our own Group Name."""
"""Now, let us see how to add GL Accounts."""
Click on the Banking and General Ledger tab.
Then click on GL Accounts link in the Maintenance panel.
Here also we need to type a unique code. It is a mandatory field.
"""In the Account Code field, I will type 1100 as the code."""
"""You can give any code of your choice, if you wish to."""
"""Click on the Account Name field. Type the Account Name as """"Land and Building""""."""
You can give any name of your choice.
"""In the Account Group drop-down box, select the Account Group as Fixed Assets."""
The Account Name Land and Building has to come under the Group Fixed Assets as per the Charts of Accounts.
"""Next, click on the Account status drop down menu. Select the status as Active."""
Then click on Add Account button at the bottom of the window.
"""We can see the message - """"New account has been added""""."""
"""Now, click on the New account drop-down box at the top. We can see the newly added Account here."""
"""Each organisation will have their own set of account codes, as shown here."""
"""Likewise, by following the above steps, you can create your own GL Accounts."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize
"""In this tutorial, We have learnt to create General Ledger Classes   ,  General Ledger Groups   and  General Ledger Accounts"""
As an assignment. Create new GL Accounts - Cash and Capital with the below details .  Save the changes
Now we have set the Charts of Accounts for our Company with new GL Accounts.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Issuing and returning a book.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how:"""
To fetch all the user details
To issue a book
To return a book.
Here we are using:
Ubuntu Version 12.04
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of:"""
Basics of Java Servlets and JSPs
Creating and viewing inventories.
"""In the earlier tutorial, we had seen how the Admin Section works."""
"""Here, in this tutorial, we have added more functionality to the Admin Section."""
"""So, let us switch to the browser."""
Let us login again as the admin.
We can see that we have two more options in the Admin Section Page - List Users and Checkout/Return Book.
"""Now, let us come to the IDE."""
We can see that in the adminsection.jsp there are two more radio buttons.
One for List Users and the other for Checkout/Return Book.
"""Now, switch back to the browser."""
We will click on the radio button for List Users.
"""It has all the details like First Name, Surname, Age, Gender and Username."""
The steps are similar to the earlier two options;
we saw them in the previous tutorial.
"""Now, let us click on the next option which is to Checkout or Return Book."""
We get a form which allows you to checkout as well as return book.
We will now see the code for the same.
Switch back to the IDE.
We clicked on Checkout/Return Book.
So menuSelection is equal to checkoutbook.
The steps are the same that we saw for List Books.
"""But here, we forward the request to checkOut.jsp using RequestDispatcher."""
"""Now, let us come to checkOut  dot jsp."""
This page is similar to that of listBooks dot jsp
except that we have a radio button against each book
so that we can Checkout/Return  that book.
We also have a User name field to get the username of the user who has to checkout the book.
We also have a Date field to set the return date of the book.
We have set the return date as one week from current date.
This is done using the class Calendar.
The add() function of this class takes two parameters.
The first is the present day of the year.
Second is the number of days to be added to the present day.
We have added seven days.
"""Now, note that  form action is equal to CheckOutServlet."""
"""Now, let us come back to the browser."""
We will  click on Book Id 1.
Type the username as arya.
We see that the return date is one week from today’s date.
Note that the number of Available Copies is 9.
Click on Checkout book.
We get the Checkout Success Page.
We will click on here to come  to the Admin Section Page.
Again click on Checkout/Return Book.
We can see that the number of Available Copies reduces to 8.
We will see the code for this now.
Come back to the IDE.
Go to CheckOutServlet.java.
We have set the errorMsgs list.
We have set the errorMsgs in the request.
We get the username from the request using getParameter.
"""Similarly, we get  checkout_book, return_book and book-id."""
"""Next, we parse the book_id as Integer from the id."""
We validate the userName and book id.
We also validate if Checkout_book and Return_Book are null.
"""Then, we validate if either of them is not null."""
"""Here, we check if the user exists in the system using userExists method."""
We then store the returned value of the method in userExists variable.
"""Now, we will see what we do in this method."""
"""Here, first we execute the query to check if the username exists in the table."""
Then we initialize the integer variable userExists to 0.
If the username exists then we set userExists to 1.
We then return the value of userExists.
"""So, if the method returns 0 then it means the user does not exist in the system."""
"""else, if user exists then we call  'bookAlreadyIssued' method."""
We then store the returned value of the method in bookIssued.
"""Here, we check if the same book has already been issued by the same user."""
"""Now, let us come to bookAlreadyIssued method."""
"""Here, we have set an integer variable bookAlreadyIssued to 0."""
We execute the query to check if a book with the same book_id is issued by the same user.
We get the book_id from Checkout table.
If BookId exists then set the variable bookAlreadyIssued to 1.
We then return the value of bookAlreadyIssued.
"""So, if the method returns 1 then it means the same user has already borrowed this book."""
"""Now, come back to the browser."""
"""Now, let us try to checkout the same book by the same user."""
Type the username as arya.
Click on the radio button against Book Id 1.
Then click on Checkout book.
"""We see that we get theerror message that """"The same user has already borrowed this book""""."""
"""Now, switch back to the IDE."""
"""If userExists in the system and if the checkout_book is not null, we call checkout method."""
Let us see what we do in this method.
"""Here, we get the availablecopies for the corresponding id."""
We get this from  Books table.
We then store the number of availablecopies into the variable availableCopies.
We check if availableCopies is greater than 0 and bookIssued  is equal to 0.
We get the dateofreturn from the request and store it in  returndate.
We then call  insertIntoCheckout.
We will see what we do in insertIntoCheckout method.
"""Here, we store the book_id, userName and returndate into the Checkout table."""
Then we call decrementAvailableCopies method.
We will see what we do in this method.
"""Here, we execute the query to decrement the Available Copies in the Books table by 1."""
Then we call the setCheckoutIntoRequest method.
Let us come to this method.
"""In this method, we set the checkout attribute into the request."""
Then we forward the request to successCheckout.jsp using RequestDispatcher.
"""If availableCopies is 0 then we print  """"There are no copies of the requested book available""""."""
"""Now, let us come to successCheckout  dot jsp."""
"""Here, first we get the checkout attribute from the request."""
We then display the success message for successful Checkout.
You can try out the different errors by yourself.
"""Now, let us return the book.  So, switch to the browser."""
"""Click on Book Id 1 and type the username as """"arya""""."""
"""Then, click on Return book."""
We get the success message that book has been successfully returned.
Click on here for another checkout/return.
"""So, we come back to  Admin Section Page."""
Click on Checkout/Return Book.
We can see that the number of Available Copies has been incremented.
We will see the code for this.
Come back to the IDE.
Open CheckOutServlet  dot  java.
We check if userExists  is equal to 1  AND return_book  is not equal to null.
Then we call returnBook method.
Let us come to this method.
"""Here, we select the totalcopies and availablecopies from Books table for the Book Id."""
We store the Total Copies and Available Copies to totcopies and availcopies.
Then we check if available copies exceed the total Copies.
"""Now, let us come back to the browser."""
Let us now return a book for a user who has not borrowed the book.
Type the User name as mdhusein.
Click on  Book Id 1.
Then click on Return book.
"""We can see that we get the error message: """"The given user has not borrowed this book!!"""""""
"""Now, come back to the IDE."""
"""Here, we check if  bookIssued is equal to 1."""
We then call  removeFromCheckout method.
Let us come to this method.
"""Here, we execute the query to delete from Checkout table the entry which has returned the book."""
"""Then, we call  incrementAvailableCopies method."""
Let us come to this method.
"""Here, we increment the Available Copies by 1."""
We execute the query to update in the Books table.
Then we call the setReturnIntoRequest method.
Let us come to this method.
"""Here, we set the returnBook attribute into the request."""
Then we forward to  successReturn page using  RequestDispatcher.
The successReturn page is similar to that we had for successCheckout page.
"""Now, come back to the browser. Come back to the login page."""
We can see that we have a link called Visitor’s Home Page.
We can see that we get a list of all the books available.
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
To list all the users
To fetch a book and To return a book.
Gives certificates to those who pass an online test.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Design a Visiting card using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
Settings for a visiting card
Designing a visiting card
Settings to print multiple copies of the visiting card
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS Inkscape version 0.48.4"""
Let us open Inkscape.
Go to File. Click on Document properties.
Change the Default units to Inches and the default Orientation to Landscape.
Let us now start designing the visiting card.
"""So, draw a rectangle using the Rectangle tool."""
Click on the Selector tool.
"""On the Tool controls bar, change the Width to 3.5 and Height to 2."""
Move it to the top left corner of the canvas.
Change the color to dark green.
Let us design a pattern now.
Select the Bezier tool and draw a wavy line.
Go to Object menu. Open Fill and Stroke.
Change the stroke color to yellow.
"""Now, draw a straight line below the wavy line."""
Select both the lines. Go to Extensions menu.
Click on Generate from path and then on Interpolate.
Check if the Exponent value is 0.
Change the Interpolation steps value to 30.
Click on Apply button and then on Close button.
Notice the Interpolation effect is now applied.
Let us give some glow effect to the Interpolate design. Select the design.
Go to Filters menu. Click on Shadows and Glows and then on Glow.
Observe the glow effect is applied to the design.
Let us import the Spoken Tutorial logo now.
I have saved it in my Documents folder.
The logo has been given to you in the Code files link.
Go to File and click on Import.
Resize the logo and keep it on the top left corner.
Let me copy the visiting card details from a LibreOffice Writer file that I had saved already.
This file has been given to you in the Codes files link.
Change the Font size to 12 and the text color to white.
Select the Spoken Tutorial word.
Change the font size to 16 and make it bold.
"""Now, our visiting card for Spoken Tutorial is ready."""
"""Next, we will learn to create multiple copies of the visiting card."""
We can do this by cloning method.
"""For doing that, we should first group all the elements."""
Press Ctrl + A to select all the elements and Ctrl + G to group them.
"""Now, go to the Edit menu."""
Click on Clone and then on Create Tiled Clones.
The Create Tiled Clones dialog box opens up.
"""Under the Symmetry tab, change the number of rows to 4 and columns to 3."""
"""Now, click on Create button."""
And then close the dialog box.
Notice that multiple copies of the visiting card appear in the canvas.
"""In this way, we can print multiple copies of the visiting card."""
Turn your attention to the visiting card at the top left.
Click on it and move it from its position.
Now delete this card as it is an extra copy.
What if there are some changes to be incorporated?
Will we have to change each and every copy of the visiting card?
Not at all. We will have to make the correction only in the original visiting card.
The same will be reflected in the copies.
Let's try this. Double-click and change the color of the word Spoken Tutorial to brown on the original card.
Observe the changes are reflected in all the visiting card copies.
"""Now, let us save the file."""
Press Ctrl + S to save the SVG file. I will choose Desktop as the location to save my file.
And I will type ST-visiting-card as the Filename and click on Save.
"""After this, we will save the file in PDF format."""
"""Once again, go to File and click on Save As."""
Change the extension to PDF and click on Save.
Change the resolution to 300 and click on OK.
Let us go to the Desktop.
Here is the file that we had saved. Let's open it.
Here are the visiting cards that we created.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: Settings for a visiting card Designing a visiting card Settings to print multiple copies of the visiting card."""
Here is an assignment for you.
Create a visiting card with your name your institute/organization name your institute/organization logo your institute/organization website address.

"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
I have got this image with an e-mail from Norman.
He asked to save it.
This is the image he has got after using RAW convertor and this here was the original image.
"""Comparing the images, it was clear what Norman has done."""
First he has rotated the image and then he has edited the image with the curves tool to get the colors and brightness in the foreground right and tried not to darken the clouds.
"""When you look at this image here, the clouds are simply gorgeous."""
"""I love them and I have asked him for permission to show this image on the show and I will try to re-do his work now and then I will try to get the clouds better, in his image."""
"""But, first let’s see if we find something in EXIF information about this image which gives clue to what went wrong ."""
"""You can see that it’s a Panasonic camera, and this camera has very tiny sensor."""
You can put this camera in your shirt pocket.
And here we have the exposure data.
One  thousand of a second Exposure Time and Aperture is 5.6.
The flash was on and the camera calculated the effect of the flash into the image.
And the flash of such  tiny camera does not work with such a scene.
"""I think, you would need something like a small nuclear bomb behind you for brightening up this part of the image."""
This image is saved in JPEG and that gives another problem.
"""This area here which is the really interesting part in this image, has become very dark because of JPEG compression."""
"""And when I zoom into the horizon, I can see a well defined stuff but a bit over-sharpened and there is also a ship on the horizon."""
"""The clouds are very detailed but when we go into the dark part, you see a tree here but nothing is clearly visible."""
This is because JPEG leaves parts out of the image which computer program in the camera doesn’t think you will ever see.
But I want to see this stuff here and I am a bit stuck with the JPEG compression because the details which are lost here will never be visible again.
"""And when you shoot this raw, you avoid such problems and in next tutorial I will show you the UF raw converter and how to use it with the gimp and I think that will be the right topic for the next tutorial."""
I load the image into the GIMP by just pulling it over to the toolbox here and enlarge the window.
"""Now, my first step will be sizing this image a bit because the image is so large that the resulting ‘XCF’ file will be more than 40 mega bytes."""
"""Sizing down can be done by clicking on Image in the tool bar, selecting Scale Image and I change the Width to say 1000 pixel and when I press Tab, I get the Height as 750 pixels and I have the best Interpola"
Press shift + Ctrl+ E to get the image full into the frame here and now I am set for editing this image.
The first step will be rotating.
"""In previous tutorials, I have shown you two ways to rotate an image and today it’s time for third way."""
"""So, I follow the same step of zooming into the image where I can see a horizontal line and the horizontal line is on the horizon because horizon by definition is horizontal."""
"""Then I select the measurement tool from the toolbox and I don’t select the info. window because it pops up in between the image frame. But I can get all the information here, below, in the status bar."""
"""Now, getting the angle of horizon is simple. Just put cursor on the horizon, press the mouse button and pull it."""
Pull the line to the other side and make a line parallel to the horizon and release the button.
Look for the angle info. in the status bar and I see here the angle is 1.64°.
"""Now I select the Rotate tool, just click into the image and type in -1.63°(degrees), minus because I want to counter the plus 1.63 °(degrees)."""
Click on Rotate and you get a rotated image.
"""Just to test the horizon, we pull down the scale and it is horizontal."""
The next step will be cropping the image. But I can’t crop the image now because this part of the image is not visible. So I really can’t judge the stuff.
"""I don’t know where to crop, so first make this part of the image a bit brighter."""
I want to work with the Curves tool but before that I make a copy of the layer.
"""Because, when we use curves tool ,information in the image is lost."""
"""So, never do something with an image which you can’t take back."""
"""Well, I did rotate it but in later steps never do anything on original image."""
"""First, I will edit the land portion; so I call this layer Land. And double click into the field where the name exists and press return."""
Now the layer is named Land.
"""I select the Curves tool, click into the image and now I will explore the image."""
"""This part of the image is really the darkest part, one can make it out easily but the grass here is also very dark."""
The water seems to be this part of the gray scale here and the sky is obviously this part.
"""So, I have to brighten the land in the image and I just do it by pulling this up."""
"""Now, the question which comes to mind is how far should I pull it because when I go too far it will look artificial."""
"""And if I want to combine the sky and the land with big differences in the curves, it will not look like a real image."""
"""So, I pull this down a bit."""
Let me try this.
This looks good here.
The sea is not too bright and the chapel is also visible.
"""So, I click on OK."""
"""After I have edited the land part, let me go to the sky."""
"""So, again make a copy of the original layer and just move it on the top and name it Sky."""
"""Double click on the layer, type the name as Sky, pressing return and we have the Sky."""
"""I want to edit only the Sky layer without harming other layers and to do that, I work with a layer mask."""
"""Right click on Sky layer, click on Add Layer Mask and select White layer mask i.e full opacity. That means, this layer is fully visible and it is white."""
I want to hide the land layer and I also don’t want sharp edge between sea and sky and for that I use the gradient tool.
A gradient is simply a thing between black and white.
Let me show you this in a scrap layer here.
"""I have selected the Gradient tool and this is the new thing I have just found out by accident that when you double click on the tool icon, the tool options are automatically selected."""
I don’t think it’s a new thing for you but it’s new for me.
Good thing to know.
"""Going back to the Gradient tool: when I pull this line here by clicking the left mouse button and release it,"""
the area to the left of the starting point is filled with black and the area on right of the end point is filled with white which is the other side of the gradient.
And the area between white and black is the different series of grays and it is called gradient.
And I can make long gradient or very short gradient
"""Here are the different gradient tools and I will stick to this one here, black and white."""
And there are lot more options here like Radial where you can make circle.
There are lot more options which you can use.
It's worth to explore these options of this tool.
"""So, I set the shape to Linear and I delete the scrap layer here."""
"""Now I am working on the Sky layer here, the gradient is set from black to white, from making the image transparent to revealing the image. And I go back to the layer dialog and check if I have activated the"
I want to paint the layer mask
and select the Zoom tool to zoom into the image.
This needs a bit of practice.
I will start at this point here and end here.
I want to have the gradient straight because gradient in this way would result in such an image which I don’t want.
Press ctrl + z to undo the step.
"""So, I press the control key and now the movement of the slider here is limited to 5 degrees."""
So I start making it from here to this point.
"""When you go back to full image, you can see that this is my gradient."""
"""And when I switch off other layers, only the upper part of the image is visible in the top layer and others are in the background."""
But I don’t think this looks very convincing.
"""This looks a bit artificial, so I want to make the sky a bit brighter now."""
"""For doing that, first I have to deactivate the layer mask and activate the layer itself for working on it. Otherwise I would have used curves tool on the layer mask."""
You can always identify the active part of the layer by white frame around it.
"""So, let's  try this here."""
"""Now we want to brighten the sky, so I am pulling this up."""
I think this looks quite convincing because the sky is bright and the artificial border between the sky and sea vanished.
I think this will work.
"""So, let’s compare the image by switching of the sky layer and layers below it."""
You can see the difference.
This is the original image.
This layer is the new sky and this is the new land below.
"""The land could use a bit more of contrast I think but I am not sure, so I will have to try this."""
"""So, simply double click the Land layer and select the Overlay mode which gives you a bit more of contrast. But this is definitely too much, so I slide down the Opacity."""
Is it looking better or not?? But I think this is better.
Now I have got four layers.
"""The Background, the original image which is not really needed any more, the Land layer, a Land copy and the Sky with the layer mask."""
"""And I can change all these values here, without loosing the image information."""
That's the great advantage of using layers.
"""Now for the last part """"cropping"""":  Norman wanted to crop it into 7:5 ratio because his printer uses 7/5 inch paper."""
"""So, let's do that. 7:5, a Fixed Aspect Ratio."""
Where to crop?? I think I forgotten where Norman cropped this image.
So let's decide here.
"""I think, the tree should be included and the dry grass should be included."""
So I have to start here at the right corner and just pull up Crop tool.
"""This is simply the matter of taste and nothing to do with pumping , one could learn."""
"""There are Rule of Thirds,"""
let me put this in.
"""Here you see, the front side of the chapel is now one of the points of interest."""
Here is the more artistic Golden sections and it can be helpful but I think the best is simply your eye.
I want to save his image as a JEPG image.
And before that I have to sharpen it a little bit.
The traces of sharpening that were visible before I did all my manipulations are gone.
White lines were visible to see hallows.
"""I think, this time also I will use the Filters, Enhance, Sharpen mode."""
"""This is basically an unsharped mask, sharpening with some standard values pre-set."""
I will cover the unsharped mask in the later tutorial.
"""I have never used that and for that, I have to learn it myself"""
so that I can explain something about it.
I think this works well here.
I can go and save the image.
I am typing funny stuff today.
OK. I know that JPEG cannot handle image with multiple layers so the image is now exported and all the layer information is lost.
And gimp just gives a warning.
And I think 85% quality is good;
The perfect compromise between file size and image quality.
"""And now, I can go back with my sharpening and resizing the image to something that I could put it in my blog for the show notes."""
Go to Image >> Scale Image and I want Width of 600 pixels.
Just Scale it .
And now I sharpen it again. Sharpening should be the last step in your chain of things you do to an image.
It is really the last step.
The algorithm works well only if you don’t change anything after that.
No resizing also.
Lets look at this.
I think I can have bit more.
Ending basically on the same amount.
"""I am ok with this image now. I save this as """".(dot)600"""" so that I can know which image to put in the blog later."""
Let's compare the 2 images.
This is the one Norman made and this is the one I made.
My sky is better definitely and I think Norman did a better job with the sea and the chapel.
And the combination of this would be a really great picture.
I think I have over-done a bit with the brightening here.
"""Well, here I am back  to fix the sea layer in easy way."""
I make a copy of original on Background layer.
Rename the layer to Sea.
"""Now, I pull it above Land copy and below the Sky."""
And you can see now the Sky layer is not disturbed by this only the land is disturbed.
But I will mask that out.
"""To do that, I add a layer mask."""
"""Right click , Add Layer Mask and now I take a Grayscale copy of the layer."""
"""Now you see the land here, it's brighter."""
It's not like it was here but you see biggest changes  in the water.
And now let's work a bit on the layer mask here.
Click on Show  Layer Mask.
You see it here and switch the Sky off.
Now I select the Curves tool and I will adjust the curves in a way that the land gets darker.
And sea and sky get brighter.
Now let's look at the image.
Unclick Show Layer Mask.
Now you see that’s quite nice for the land with nearly no difference and the sea is better.
Now when I select the Sea layer you can see that the sea is better.
Now I will change the values in the image by using the Curves tool.
"""And I think, I should"""
"""give the sea a bit more contrast,"""
bit like this here.
The steep of the slope here is more contrast in the image.
This part of the histogram was sea.
"""So, I get here a lot of contrast."""
And just fiddle around with the curve until it fits a bit.
I haven’t tried this before; so I have to experiment here a little bit.
I think this is way better than the stuff I had before.
Now let's look at the border between the rocks here and sea.
I had a big problem there before.
So this time I nearly got no visible hallows.
"""And when I zoom into this here,"""
you can see something like hallow but it's simply surf at the beach here.
There is no hallow.
"""In my first tries, I tried to get differences between land sea and sky a bit more."""
I have simply over-done it.
"""But this way here, I think, it works better. So is there anything left to be done?"""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on 2 Dimensional Arrays in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn-"""
what is a 2 Dimensional array.
We will do this through an example.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using"""
"""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
Let us start with the introduction to 2 dimensional Array.
2D arrays are stored in a row column matrix.
The left index indicates the row.
The right index indicates the column.
Starting index of a matrix or array in C and C++ is always 0.
"""Here, we see a 2 Dimensional array in a row column matrix."""
Starting index is 0.
"""Now, let us see how to declare 2 dimensional array."""
The Syntax for this is:
"""data-type ,array name, row and column."""
"""example, here we have declared a 2 dimensional array num with 2 rows and 3 columns."""
Now let us see an example.
"""I have already typed the program, let me open it."""
Note that our file name is 2d hyphen array dot c.
"""In this program, we will calculate the sum of the elements of the 2 dimensional array."""
Let me explain the code now.
This is our header file.
Here we have declared variables i and j.
Then we have declared num1 with 3 rows and 4 columns.
"""And num2, again with 3 rows and 4 columns."""
num1 and num2 are 2 dimensional arrays.
"""Here, we take elements of the matrix num1 as input from the user."""
The elements are stored row-wise.
We have considered i for rows and j for columns.
This for loop will check the condition that i runs from 0 to 2.
This for loop will check the condition that j runs from 0 to 3.
"""Similarly, here we take elements of the matrix num2 as input from the user."""
Here we display the matrix num1.
Here percent 3d is used to align the matrix on the terminal.
"""Now, here we display the matrix num2."""
Then we add the num1 matrix and the num2 matrix and display the result.
This is our return statement.
"""Now, click on Save."""
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space 2d hyphen array dot c space hyphen o space arr and press Enter."""
"""To execute, type dot slash arr (./arr), now press Enter ."""
Here we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num1.
I will enter the values now.
Now we can see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num2.
I will enter the values.
The output is displayed.
Here we can see the num1 matrix.
Here we can see the num2 matrix.
And this is the sum of num1 and num2.
Now we will see how to execute the same program in C++.
I have already made the program. I will open it and explain.
This is the program for 2 Dimensional arrays in C++.
Note that our file name is 2d hyphen array dot cpp.
The extension is dot cpp (.cpp).
Let me explain the code now.
This is our header file as iostream.
This is our using statement.
Here we have cout function as we use cout to print the output in C++.
Then we have cin function. We use cin to read  a line in C++.
"""Here, we use  / t  bit mean horizontal tab that is equivalent to 4 spaces."""
Rest of the code is similar to our C code.
Let us execute. Come back to a terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space 2d hyphen array dot cpp  hyphen o space arr1 and press  Enter."""
"""To execute, type dot slash arr1, now press Enter."""
I will enter the values.
"""Now, we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num2."""
I will give the values as:
The output is displayed.
"""We can see the num1 matrix, the num2 matrix."""
And this is the sum of num1 and num2.
Come back to our slide. Let us Summarize.
In this tutorial we learnt:
To add elements in a 2D array.
To print 2D array.
And to calculate the sum of 2Dimensional array.
As an assignment: Write the  program that takes two 2Dimensional arrays as input from the user.
Subtract them and find the result.

Thank you for watching.
Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on conditional statements in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about-  if,  else,  else if in awk."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the previous awk tutorials on our website."""
You should have familiarity with any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
A conditional statement allows us to check a specified condition before performing an action.
"""Let’s learn how conditional statements like if, else, else-if work in awk."""
"""Like any programming language, the syntax of 'if -else' statement is:"""
if conditional-expression1 is true then perform action1.
else if conditional-expression2 is true then perform action 2.
A number of else if statements may follow after this.
"""At the end, if none of the specified conditional expressions are true then perform action n."""
The else and else-if portions are optional. Let us go through an example.
We will use the same awkdemo.txt file that we have used earlier.
"""Say, we need to give 50% increment in stipend to the students getting more than 8000 rupees."""
Let us create an awk file for this condition.
"""Type the following code as shown, in a text editor and save it as cond dot awk. I have already done this."""
The same file is also available in the Code Files link.
"""In this code, we have set the Output Field Separator as colon."""
The first print statement prints the field headings.
"""Next, the 'if' statement will check whether the value of the 6th field is greater than 8000."""
"""If yes, the second print statement will get executed."""
$6 into 1.5 inside this print statement will multiply the 6th field value by 1.5 .
Let’s execute this code now.
"""Open the terminal by pressing CTRL, ALT and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using 'cd' command.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen capital F pipe symbol within double quotes space hyphen small f space cond dot awk space awkdemo dot txt. Press Enter."""
The output shows only one student’s record with the incremented stipend who fulfilled the condition.
"""Now, suppose the rule changes: 50% increment in stipend for students who get more than 8000 rupees."""
"""Otherwise, give 30% increment. How can we do that?"""
We need to add an 'else' block.
Switch to the cond dot awk file once again.
Let us add the following line of code. Before the last closing curly brace press Enter.
else press Enter.
print space dollar 2 comma dollar 6 comma dollar 6 into 1.3
Press the up-arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
Observe the output now. Yojna Chaudhury was previously getting 1000. Now she is getting 1300.
Let’s change the rules again. 50% increment for student getting more than 8000 rupees.
"""40% increment for student getting more than 4000 rupees. Otherwise, give 30% increment."""
Switch to the code. Update the code as shown.
Let me clear the terminal.
"""Now, press up-arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter."""
"""This time, notice that the student Mira Nair has got 40% increment."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt about Conditional statements like: if ,  else, else if in awk."""
"""As an assignment, give grades according to the rules: If mark is greater than equal to 90, grade will be A."""
"""If mark is greater than equal to 80 but less than 90, grade will be B."""
"""If mark is greater than equal to 70 but less than 80, grade will be C."""
"""If mark is greater than equal to 60 but less than 70, grade will be D. Otherwise, grade will be F."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on while loop in java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn: About the while loop and How to use it."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse 3.7."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of relational operators in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown. [1]"""
Here is the structure of a while loop.
It has two parts.
One is the loop running condition and the  second is the loop variable.
Let us now look at an example. Switch to Eclipse.
"""Here, we have the eclipse IDE and  the skeleton   required  for rest of the code."""
I have created a class WhileDemo and added the main method to it.
We shall print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop. Type: int n = 1;.
This variable 'n' is going to be our loop variable.
Type: while in parenthesis n less than or  equal to  10  open and close braces.
This condition is called  loop running condition.
It means the loop will run as long as this condition is true.
"""In our case, it will run as long as the value of 'n' is less than or equal to 10."""
And it will stop only when the value of 'n' becomes greater than 10.
"""Inside the loop, we shall print the value of 'n'."""
System.out.println(n); and then increment it n = n + 1;
"""This way, first 1 is printed and then the value of 'n' becomes 2."""
Then the loop condition is checked.
"""Since it is true, 2 is printed and n becomes 3."""
And so on.. loop progresses until 10 is printed.  After that 'n' becomes 11 and the condition is not true and the loop will stop.
"""So, let us see the code in action."""
Save and  run.
"""As we can see, the numbers from 1 to 10 are printed."""
"""Now, we shall  print numbers from 50 to 40."""
"""So, we start with 50. Change n = 1 to n = 50."""
"""And We go till 40,"""
"""in other words, as long as 'n' is greater than or equal to 40. So, change the condition to  n   greater than or equal to 40."""
"""And since we are looping from a bigger number to a smaller number, we have decremented the loop variable."""
So Change n=n+1 to n=n-1.
"""Save and run. As we can see, the numbers from 50 to 40 have been printed."""
Now we shall print the first 10 multiples of 7.
"""To do that, we start with 7."""
"""So, change n = 50 to n = 7 and then we end with 70."""
Change the condition to n less than or equal to 70.
"""This way, we make sure that the loop stops at 70."""
"""To get the multiples, we shall increment the loop variable by 7."""
"""So, change n=n-1 to n= n+7;"""
"""This way, first 7 is printed and  then 'n' becomes 14, 14 is printed and so on until 70. Save and run."""
"""As we can see, the first 10 multiples of 7 are  printed."""
We can also use a while loop to get the sum of digits of a number.
Let us see how to do so.
"""First, clear the main method."""
int n equal to 13876;. This is the number.
Then int dSum equal to  0. The variable dsum which is symbolic for digit sum will contain the sum of digits.
Type: while n greater than 0 open close parentheses.
The reason for using this condition will be evident in a while.
"""To get the sum of digits, we must first get the digits."""
"""To do that, we use the modulo operator."""
"""Type: dSum = dSum + (n % 10) So, we get the unit's digit and add it to dsum."""
After that  we remove the digit by dividing by 10. n = n / 10
"""So when the loop is  run  for the first time, dSum will be 6 and 'n' will become 1387."""
"""And when the loop is run for the second time, dSum will be sum of 7 and 6 which is 13 and 'n' will become 138."""
"""And so on as the loop progresses, the digits will be  removed from n and finally"""
n becomes zero. After that the condition 'n greater than 0' will be false and the loop will stop.
"""So, let us now add a print statement:"""
System.out.println(dSum)
Let us see the code in action. Save and run.
"""As we can see, the sum of digits which is 25 has been printed."""
This way a while loop which is one of the most fundamental constructs in programming can be used.
This brings us to the end of the tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we have learned: About while loop.How to use it."""
"""As an assignment for this tutorial, solve the following problem."""
"""Given a number, compute its reverse by using a while loop. Example: 19435 => 53491"""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Text tool features” using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
Manual kerning Spell checking
Super-script Sub-script.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS Inkscape version 0.48.4."
I will be recording this tutorial in maximum resolution mode. This is to accommodate all the tools that will be demonstrated.
Let us open Inkscape.
"""Earlier in the series, we learnt to create and format text using the Text tool."""
"""Now, we will learn some important features of the Text tool. Click on it."""
Let us start with Manual kerning.
"""Horizontal kerning, Vertical shift and Character rotation are called manual kerns."""
Type the word Spoken.
Keep the cursor after the alphabet “S”.
Horizontal kerning adds space after the selected letter.
Click on the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the space between the letters “S” and “p”.
Notice that the space is introduced only between the letters “S” and “p”.
Let me keep the Horizontal kerning parameter as 3.
"""The next icon, i.e. Vertical shift, shifts the letters after the selected letter up or down."""
Click on the up and down arrows.
Observe the letters after the cursor have shifted up and down.
Keep this parameter as 15.
"""Next, we will rotate our characters using Character rotation."""
This icon rotates only a single character which is right after the cursor.
"""So, place the cursor before the letter “e”."""
Click on the up and down arrows of Character rotation and observe that the letter “e” rotates.
"""To apply the kerns to more than one character, select the characters first then give the values."""
"""Let me select the letters “p” and “o” and give Horizontal kerning parameter as 5,"""
Vertical shift parameter as 10 and Character rotation parameter as 20.
Observe the changes.
"""To remove the kerns, go to Text menu."""
Click on Remove Manual Kerns.
Manual Kerns can be used only in Regular text.
"""In Flowed text, these options will be disabled."""
"""To check, create a text box."""
"""Observe, the Manual kerns options are now disabled."""
Press Ctrl + Z to undo this action.
"""Next, we will learn about Spell check feature."""
"""To explain the Spell check feature, I will copy text from LibreOffice writer that I had saved already."""
Press Ctrl + A to select the entire text and then press Ctrl + C to copy it.
Now come back to Inkscape.
Click on the canvas and press Ctrl + V to paste the text.
Go to Text menu and click on Check Spelling option.
A new dialog box appears.
All text is checked regardless of whether it is selected or not.
"""When a suspect word is found, it will be highlighted with a red box and the cursor will be placed before the text."""
A list of suggestions appears for the word “http”.
Since the spelling is correct we will add this word to the dictionary.
"""To do so, click on Add to Dictionary button."""
This will cause the spell checker to accept the word as correctly spelled always.
"""Next, the word “tutorial” is highlighted."""
"""Since the spelling is wrong, select the correct word from the suggestion list which is “tutorial”."""
Now click on Accept button.
"""If you click on Ignore, all other similarly spelled words in the document will get ignored."""
"""If you click on Ignore once, the word will get ignored only once i.e the first time only."""
"""If you want to stop the spell-checking process, click on Stop."""
We can restart the process by clicking the Start button.
Spell checking will begin with the text at the top-right and work down the canvas.
Let us close this dialog box now and keep this text aside.
"""Next, we will learn to write Superscript and Subscript."""
Type the mathematical formula (a+b)2 = a2+b2+2ab.(a + b whole square is equal to a square plus b square plus 2ab).
We have to change the number 2 as square in three places.
Select the first 2. Go to Tool controls bar. Click on Toggle Superscript icon.
"""In a similar way, change the remaining 2s."""
"""Next, we will write a chemical formula using subscript."""
"""So, type “H2SO4”."""
Here 2 and 4 should be written as subscripts.
First select 2. Go to Tool controls bar and click on Toggle Subscript icon.
"""In a similar way, change the 4."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
Manual kerning Spell checking
Super-script and Sub-script.
Here are 2 assignments for you-
Write the text “How are you” and change the font size to 75.
Keep the cursor next to “w”. Change Horizontal kerning parameter to -20.
Select the words are. Change the Vertical shift parameter to 40.
Select the words you. Change the Character rotation parameter to -30.
Write the following formulae using Sub-script and Super-script options.
Silver sulfate - Ag₂SO₄.
a2−b2=(a−b)(a+b)
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on working with Linux Processes.
We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands.
"""If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial on the following website http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Also note that Linux is case sensitive. All the commands used in this tutorial are in lower case unless otherwise mentioned.
"""To understand what a process is, let me give you a brief explanation."""
Anything that is running in Linux is a process.
The shell that is running and taking our commands is a process.
The commands that we type on the terminal are processes when they are running.
The video in which you are seeing this tutorial is a process.
The browser running in which you have opened the spoken tutorial website is a process.
Shell scripts that are running are processes and so on.
A process can be defined as a program which is being executed i.e. which is running.
"""Processes are much like us. They are born, they die. They have parent and children."""
Let us first learn about the shell process.
The shell process is started by the Linux kernel as soon as we login to the system.
"""At this point, it would suffice to know that the Linux kernel is the core of the Linux operating system."""
It consists of the most essential components that make Linux run. The shell creates or gives birth to all the other user command processes.
Let us open a terminal.
We can see the command prompt on the terminal in the form of a dollar sign ($).
This is the job of the shell process.
"""Now, let us type any command, say date and press Enter."""
"""As soon as we do this, the shell process will create a process called date."""
"""Now, since the shell process has given birth to the 'date' process, we can say that the shell process is the parent of the 'date' process and the 'date' process is the child of the shell process."""
"""Once date process has shown the system date and time, it will die."""
A shell can also give birth to another shell process. Giving birth to a process or creating a process is also called spawning a process.
"""To spawn another shell process, simply go to the terminal and type “sh” and press Enter."""
"""We would see a new prompt appearing in the terminal. Now our original shell, let us call it 'shell 1', has given birth to a child shell or sub shell; let us call it 'shell 2'."""
"""Now, you may run a command in the new command prompt as well. Let us run 'ls' command in this new command prompt."""
"""Now at the command prompt, type “ls” and press Enter. We can see a list of files and directories."""
Now a new process named 'ls' is created.
"""Here, 'shell 2' is the parent of 'ls', while 'shell 1' is the grandparent of 'ls'. 'ls' is the child of 'shell 2', while 'shell 2' itself is the child of 'shell1'."""
"""To kill 'shell 2', simply type at the new prompt “exit” and press Enter."""
This will kill 'shell 2' and we will get back our original command prompt.
"""Continuing our analogy between us and processes, we know that each of us have some attributes that identify us. Those attributes can be our name, parents' name , date of birth, PAN card no. etc."""
"""Similarly, processes also have attributes like PID(Process ID), PPID(Parent Process ID), Start time  etc."""
Most of these attributes are maintained by the kernel in a process table.
Each process is uniquely identified by a unique integer called the 'PID'. 'PID' is allotted by the kernel when the process is born.
The 'PID' of the parent process that spawned a new process say 'P1' is called the 'PPID' of 'P1' process.
"""To see the PID of the current shell, at the prompt type: echo space dollar dollar and press Enter."""
A number would be shown . This is the 'PID' of the current shell.
The one command that we would use a lot while talking about processes is the 'ps' command.
'ps' or process status is a command which displays the processes running in the system.
Let us see what happens if we run this command without any options.
"""Now, at the command prompt, type: “ps” and press Enter."""
"""This way, we would normally see the list of all the processes owned by the user running the program."""
You can see the name of the process under 'CMD' heading.
"""Other than this, you can see the PID, TTY or the console at which the process is running,"""
"""the TIME, that is the total processor time that has been used since the process started."""
"""On my machine, it displays two processes."""
"""One is the bash, the shell process we are using. The other is the 'ps' process itself."""
The other important thing to note here is that the PID of the shell process is same as that shown by the echo space dollar dollar command.
"""If we spawn a sub-shell, let us see what happens. At the terminal, type “sh” and press Enter."""
"""Now, in the new prompt that appears on the new line, type “ps” and press Enter."""
Now we can see 3 processes in the list . The process 'sh' has been added.
"""Here, again notice that the PID of the bash process is same as that before."""
"""'ps' comes with many options as we would see next. First option that we would see, displays more attributes for the processes listed."""
"""Now, at the prompt, type: ps space minus f and press Enter. This again will list three processes as in the previous case."""
"""Bash, sh and ps -f."""
The only difference is now more attributes are listed.
"""'UID' gives the user name of the user who has started the process. Also, it shows the 'PPID' that is the 'PID' of the parent process that created the process."""
"""For example, see that 'bash' process is the parent of 'sh' process; so the 'PID' of the 'bash' is same as the 'PPID' of 'sh' process."""
"""Similarly, since 'sh' process is the parent of 'ps' process, the PID of 'sh' process is the same as the PPID of the ps -f process."""
"""'C' stands for processor utilization. Currently, this is the integer value of the percent usage of the processor over the lifetime of the process."""
It will be displayed as 0 (zero) in this case as the usage is negligible.
"""The STIME field gives the time at which the process started, the rest we have already seen while running 'ps'."""
Processes are of two types : First one is User processes- those are started by the users.
For example 'ps' or for that reason most commands that we run on the terminal.
"""Second one is the system processes- those processes are started by the system, often during system startup or user login."""
Example of system process can be bash.
"""Sometimes we may want to see all the processes, both- system processes as well as user processes."""
Then we use the  'minus e'  or the 'minus capital A' option.
Go to the terminal and type at the prompt: ps space minus e and press Enter.
We can see a large list of processes.
"""To get a multi-page display, just type at the prompt:"""
ps space minus e space vertical bar space more and press Enter.
"""As we have seen before, more will cause only as many processes to be listed as can fit in one window."""
"""As we press Enter, we scroll through the list of processes."""
The first process in this list is interesting. It is called the init process.
It is the process from which almost all other processes are spawned.
It has a 'PID' of 1.
"""To come back to the prompt, press 'q'."""
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learned about process, shell process, spawning of process, process attributes and different types of processes."""
We also learned the use of 'ps' command. This brings me to the end of this tutorial.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Switch Case in Java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the switch case construct in Java."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu v 11.10, JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of if else statement in Java."""
"""If not, please go through the tutorials on these topics available at our website which is as shown [1]"""
switch case: The switch case is used to perform actions based on the value of a variable.
Here is the syntax for a switch case statement.
Let us use it now.
I already have Eclipse opened.
I have created a class named SwitchCaseDemo.
"""Now, let us add some variables."""
"""Inside the main method, we will create a variable day of type int."""
"""So, type inside the main method int day and we can give it a value equal to 3 semicolon."""
"""Now, let us create a variable dName of type String."""
String dName we can initialize it to null.
"""Here, dName is a variable to hold the name of the days of a week."""
day stores the day number.
"""Now, we will type the switch case statement. So, next line, type:"""
switch within brackets day then open curly brackets Press Enter.
This statement defines which variable is under consideration for the cases.
"""Next line, type:"""
case 0 colon.
"""Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Sunday semicolon."""
Then type: Next line break;
This statement says that if the day is 0 then dName must be set to Sunday.
Note that a break statement must be used at the end of each case.
"""without the break statement, the switch-case functions in a complex fashion."""
It will be explained in subsequent part of the tutorial.
"""Similarly, let us type the remaining cases."""
"""Next line, type: case 1 colon."""
"""Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Monday  semicolon."""
"""Next line, type break;"""
Then type: case 2 colon.
"""Next line, dName equal to  Tuesday then semicolon."""
"""Next line, type break;"""
"""Then next line, case 3 colon."""
"""Next line, type: dName equal to within double quotes Wednesday  then semicolon"""
"""Next line, type break;"""
Then case 4 colon.
"""Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Thursday then semicolon."""
Then break .
"""Then next line, type: case 5 colon."""
dName equal to within double quotes Friday then semicolon.
Then break.
Then case 6 colon.
"""Next line, type: dName equal to within double quotes Saturday  then semicolon."""
Then type: break semicolon.
Then close the brackets.
"""Now, let us add a print statement and see the code in action."""
"""So, next line, type: System  dot out dot println within brackets dName  then semicolon."""
Now Save and run the file.
Now press Ctrl S and Ctrl F11 keys.
We get the output as: Wednesday which is corresponding to the case 3.
"""Now, let us change the value of the  day and see the result."""
So change 3 to 0.
Now Save and Run that file.
"""As we can see, the output is Sunday corresponding to the case 0."""
"""Now, what if there is no case corresponding to the value. So, let us see that."""
Change day equal to -1 Save and run the file.
"""As we can see, there is no output."""
But it would be better if we could have a case for all other values.
That is done by using the default keyword.
"""So, after the last case, type:"""
default  colon.
"""Next line, dName equal to within double quotes Wrong Choice then semicolon."""
"""Next line, break  semicolon."""
We do not say case default;
Note that we simply use the keyword default.
"""Now, let us run the code. So save and run the file."""
"""As we can see, the default case is executed and the required message Wrong choice is printed."""
Let us try with another random value.
Change -1 to 15.
"""As we can see, again the default case is executed."""
"""Now, let us see what happens if we remove the break statement."""
"""So, Let us change day = 15 to day = 4,"""
remove the corresponding break statement for day =4.
"""Although the case is 4, we get the output as Friday and not Thursday."""
This is because of the way switch case works.
"""First, the value of day is compared with 0."""
"""Then with 1, then with 2 and so on with all the possible cases."""
"""When a match is found, it executes all the case from the match onwards."""
"""In our case, it executed case 5 after case 4."""
Then it stops because of the break statement in case 5.
"""To avoid that, we need to add a break statement in each case."""
Let us now add the break statement we have removed.
"""So, type: break semicolon."""
Now let us run the code.
"""As we can see, now only case 4 is executed."""
"""As a rule, remember to use a break statement in every case, to avoid errors."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt how to use switch case construct and how to use break statement."""
"""As an assignment, write a program that has a name and gender as a variable. Use a switch case statement that prints “Hello Mr....” for males and “Hello Ms...” for females."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Getting started with Eclipse.
"""In this tutorial, we are going to learn:"""
How to  create a project and add a class in Eclipse
How to write a java program and
How to run a java program in Eclipse.
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10, Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have"""
Eclipse installed on your system.
"""If not, for relevant tutorial please visit our website as shown."""
Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment.
"""It is a tool on which one can write, debug and run java programs easily."""
Now let us open Eclipse.
"""Press Alt F2 and in the dialog box, type eclipse and hit Enter."""
We have the Workspace Launcher dialog box.
A workspace is a location where all your project related data and your eclipse related files are stored.
There is already a location which is the default location.
"""Using the Browse feature, a different directory can also be selected."""
"""For now, let us proceed with the default directory."""
Click OK to proceed.
And we have the Welcome to Eclipse page.
Click Workbench  which is  at the top-right corner of the page.
And here we have Eclipse IDE. Now let us add a project.
"""Go to File , New,  select Project."""
"""In the list of projects, select Java Project."""
"""Also note that, for most of our tutorials, we will be using Java Project. Click Next."""
"""In the project name, type EclipseDemo."""
Notice an option that says Use default location.
"""If this option is selected, all the 'EclipseDemo' project data is stored in the default workspace."""
"""If it is unselected, using the Browse feature, a different location can also be selected."""
"""For now, we’ll use the default location."""
"""click Finish, located at the bottom right corner of the Wizard."""
We get the Open Associated Perspective dialog box.
A perspective refers to the way items are arranged in Eclipse.
The dialog box is suggesting a perspective that is suited for Java development.
Select Remember my decision  and click Yes.
Here we have EclipseIDE with the project. Now let us add a class to the project.
"""Right click on the project, New and select Class."""
"""In the class name, give DemoClass."""
"""Notice that in Modifiers, we have two options, public and default."""
"""For now, leave it as public."""
The other options will be discussed in subsequent tutorials.
"""And in the list of method stubs, select the option that says, public static void main."""
The other options will be discussed in subsequent tutorials.
"""Click Finish, located at the bottom right corner of the wizard."""
And here we have the class file.
Notice that there are a lot of partitions. These are called portlets.
We have the Package Explorer portlet that behaves like a File Browser.
We have the Editor portlet in which we write the code.
And the Outline portlet which gives us hierarchy of the project.
Each portlet can also be resized.
They can also  be minimized by using the Minimize button.
They can be restored by using the Restore button.
Now let us minimize other portlets and focus on the Editor.
"""As we can see, there is already some code, Eclipse has generated for us."""
The code generated here depends on the options we select while creating the class.
"""Now, let us add a print statement here."""
Type: System.out.println in parenthesis in quotes  “Hello Eclipse”
Add a semicolon at the end of the statement.
Save the file by clicking  File and select Save.
"""Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Control  S  also."""
"""To run this program, right click on the editor, go to Run as and select Java Application."""
"""We see that if something is printed, the Output console shows the output."""
"""If our code had problems, the problems would have been shown on the Problems portlet."""
Here is how you write and run a Java program in Eclipse.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt: how to create a project in eclipse and add a class to it, how to write java source code and how to run a java program in Eclipse."""
"""As an assignment for this tutorial, create a project by the name Display"""
and add a class to the 'Display' project by the name 'Welcome'.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Static Variables.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: What are static variables,"""
creating static variables and how to use static variables.
"""Here, we are using: Ubuntu 12.04,  JDK 1.7 and   Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
"""You should also have the knowledge of classes, objects  and instance variables in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
A static variable is a variable which is associated with the entire class.
It is also called a class variable.
It is declared using the static keyword.
We have seen about static variable briefly in the earlier tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we will see it in detail."""
"""Now, we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called StaticVariableDemo."""
"""Inside this project, we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Static variables."""
"""So, right-click on src folder and click New > Class and type the name of the class as StudentEnroll and press Enter."""
Let us illustrate the usage of static variables with an example.
Consider a class created to represent student enrollments in an organisation.
"""This class contains the Name, Id , Branch and Total Count of students enrolled."""
"""Now, let us visualize what happens when student enrollments are done."""
"""By default, Total Count is 0. The Name of the first student is ADIL."""
"""Id is IT101, Branch is IT."""
Now the Total Count is updated as 1.
"""Similarly when the second student AMAL gets enrolled, Total Count is updated to 2."""
"""When the third student CAROL gets enrolled, Total Count is updated to 3."""
Now we can identify that the variable Total Count is common to all the objects and has a single value.
"""So, the variable Total Count can be represented as a static variable."""
"""We can also see that the variables Name, Id and Branch have their own copies for each object."""
Also they have specific values for each object.
"""So, these variables can be treated as instance variables."""
"""Now, let us look at the code representing the student Enroll class."""
"""The instance variables are declared as id, name and branch."""
The variable count is declared as static since it is common to the whole class.
"""When a class is loaded, a static variable occupies a single fixed memory location."""
Whereas Instance variables of each object occupy separate memory locations.
Now click on Source > and select Generate Constructor using Fields.
Delete the super keyword from the generated code.
"""This constructor can initialise the values of the id, name and branch fields."""
We also need to increment the value of the variable count by one every time an object is created.
"""So, inside the constructor, type: count ++ semicolon."""
"""Now we will add a method showData( ) to this class, to print the values of all the variables."""
"""So, type public void showData( )  within brackets type the following code to print the values of id, name, branch, and total number of students enrolled."""
Now right-click on the default package and click on New > Class and then type name as Demo.
"""Inside this class, we will have the main method."""
"""So, type main and then press ctrl+space to generate the main method."""
Now we need to print the Student Enrollment data.
We will create a few objects of StudentEnroll class to represent student enrollments.
"""So, type the following code:  StudentEnroll s1 equals new StudentEnroll."""
Now we can pass the values of different arguments.
"""Within brackets, type IT101 as id, ADIL as name and IT as branch."""
Now let us invoke the showData method to print the enrollment details.
"""So, type: s1.showData( ). Now run the Demo program."""
We can see that the values of the instance variables corresponding to s1 get printed.
Also note that the value of the number of student enrollments is 1.
This is because we have created only 1 object.
Now type the following code to create one more object s2.
The showData method can be called once again using s2.
Again run the Demo Program.
We can see that the values of the instance variables corresponding to s2 get printed.
"""Also, note that the value of number of student enrollments is updated to 2 for both s1 and s2."""
Now create one more object s3.
Now let us Invoke the showData method again using s3.
Run the Demo program again.
We can see that the values of instance variables corresponding to s3 get printed.
Also note that the value of number of student enrollments is now updated to 3 in all the cases.
Now we can understand that value of number of student enrollments is common to all the objects.
Come back to slides.
The static modifier is also used along with the final modifier.
It is done to define a constant which is common to the entire class.
"""Conventionally, the names of such constant variables are spelt in uppercase letters."""
Now come back to eclipse.
Open the StudentEnroll class and type the variable declaration as  public static final String ORG_NAME = “IITB”;
"""As an example, if all the students are getting enrolled to the same organisation, say IITB."""
It can be represented by using a constant static variable say ORG_NAME.
"""If the name is composed of more than one word, the words are separated by an underscore."""
Usually we declare such constants with a public visibility.
Now go to the Demo class and type the following code.
Here you can see that ORG_NAME is accessed by using its class name StudentEnroll.
Now run the Demo program again.
We can see that the ORGANISATION name is getting printed as IITB.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about:"""
What is a static variable and when it is used
How to create and invoke the static variables.
"""As an Assignment, design a class CarService to represent a car service station."""
"""This class should contain variables to represent the following details: Name of the Service Station,"""
"""Car make, model and register number - which are in for service"""
No. of Cars in for Service.
Identify the instance variables and static variables.
Declare them using suitable keywords.
"""Define a constructor to initialise the values for Car make, model and register number."""
Define a method show( ) to print the values of all the variables.
"""Also, create a Demo class containing the main method to verify the results i.e create a few objects of CarService."""
Invoke the show( ) method using these objects.
"""Also, access the static variables directly using the class name."""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Java Servlets and JSPs.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
Web server  Web container.
We will also learn to create a simple Java Servlet  and JSP.
Firefox web-browser 21.0.
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of:"""
Core Java using Netbeans IDE and
HTML.
"""Before moving onto Servlets and JSP, let us first understand a web server."""
A web server is a system that delivers content to end-users over the Internet.
It is also known as Internet server.
A web container is a component of the web server that interacts with Java servlets.
It is also known as servlet container.
The servlet container allows the servlets to execute inside it.
"""Now, let us learn how to write a simple servlet."""
Switch to the Netbeans IDE.
Click on the Project tab on the left hand side of the IDE.
"""Earlier, we had created a simple Project named MyFirstProject."""
"""You can see it here, on the left hand side of the IDE."""
Let us now create a simple servlet inside this Project.
"""So, right-click on MyFirstProject."""
Go to New and click on Servlet.
A New Servlet window opens.
Type the Class Name as MyServlet.
Type the Package name as org.spokentutorial.
Then click on Next.
Click on Add information to deployment descriptor (web.xml).
We can see that the Class Name is org.spokentutorial.MyServlet.
We can see that the Servlet Name is same as that of the Class Name which is MyServlet.
Note that the URL pattern is the same name as that of the Class Name. i.e MyServlet.
We can change it to MyServletPath.
Then click on Finish.
The source code created by the IDE for MyServlet.java is seen in the Source Editor window.
We see MyServlet.java is created in the package org.spokentutorial.
Notice that the servlet is just like any other Java class
except that the servlet does not have a main method.
"""Now, let us learn something about Glassfish Server."""
A servlet is deployed in a servlet container.
We are using Glassfish as our server.
Servlet container is a component of Glassfish that interacts with servlets.
"""Now, let us come back to Netbeans IDE."""
Note that MyServlet extends the HttpServlet.
"""At the bottom of the code, we can see HttpServlet methods."""
Click on the plus sign on the left to view these methods.
"""We see the methods - doGet, doPost and getServletInfo methods."""
We can override these methods.
We can see that there is one more method named processRequest at the top.
We will delete processRequest and getServletInfo methods to avoid confusion.
"""So, we are left with two methods doGet and doPost."""
"""For now, we will look at the doGet method."""
doGet is the default method for any simple URLrequest.
"""So, we will type some code inside the doGet method."""
We had already deleted processRequest method.
"""So, remove the method call for processRequest method."""
Also remove it from the doPost method.
"""Now, let us come to the doGet method"""
We can see that there are two parameters that are passed to the doGet method.
One is the request and the other is the response object.
Also notice that request is of type HttpServletRequest.
And response object is of  type HttpServletResponse.
We will use the response object to send the HTML response back to the client side.
"""For that, we will have to create a PrintWriter object."""
Notice that the PrintWriter class is already imported.
"""So, inside the doGet method type: PrintWriter space writer equal to response dot getWriter open and close brackets semicolon."""
Press Enter.
"""On the next line, type:"""
writer dot println within brackets and double quotes Welcome.
"""Then, press Ctrl S to save the file."""
"""Now, let us run the servlet."""
"""So, on the left hand side, in the Projects tab right click on MyServlet dot java."""
"""Then, click on Run File."""
We get a Set Servlet Execution URI dialog box.
Click on OK.
"""When the browser window opens, look at the URL."""
It is localhost colon 8080 slash MyFirstProject slash MyServletPath.
"""Here, MyFirstProject is the context name and MyServletPath is the URL pattern that we had set."""
We can see the text Welcome printed on the browser.
Now go back to the Netbeans IDE.
"""In the println method, we can pass html code."""
"""For example, put Welcome in h3 tag."""
"""Now, save the file."""
"""Since we deployed this servlet earlier, we need not run it again."""
The web container automatically detects it.
"""So, we can go back to the browser."""
Refresh.We see the message Welcome in a different format.
"""Now, come back to the IDE."""
"""Thus, we have successfully created a servlet."""
We can create any web application using servlets.
We used the servlet to display an HTML code.
Notice that we have HTML code inside the Java code.
"""Even though this is possible, it is difficult to do for large web applications."""
And hence not a recommended practice.
It would be better to replace this using JSP or Java Server Pages.
We will see the use of servlets and JSPs.
Servlets and JSPs are used together to separate presentation from content.
Servlets act as the controller and JSPs act as the view .
Servlets contain HTML code inside Java code.
JSPs contain Java code inside HTML code.
We will learn more about these in the coming tutorials.
"""Now, switch back to Netbeans IDE."""
We will now create a simple JSP page.
"""So, right click on MyFirstProject."""
Go to New and click on JSP.
A New JSP window opens.
Type the Filename as welcome.
And then click on Finish.
Click on the Projects tab  on the left hand side.
We can see that Welcome.jsp is under Web Pages folder.
"""Now, in the editor, change Hello World to Welcome."""
"""Notice that Welcome is within  """"h1"""" tags."""
"""In the url, after MyFirstProject slash, type: welcome.jsp."""
We see the output Welcome.
"""Therefore, for presentation purpose JSP is preferred."""
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
About web server and web container.
To create a simple servlet.
To create a simple JSP.
Please make sure that you have completed this tutorial before proceeding further.

Welcome to Meet the GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""For today’s tutorial I promised you with a question and answer edition, so let’s start with some news."""
I have already informed you about 'gimpusers.com' and they have a great news about a video podcast of the GIMP but I think you know that podcast already.
"""So, let’s go to the download page and here you see that GIMP 2.4.0 release candidate and is available for Windows and I think for Apple Macintosh and in source for most linux systems except for mine"""
because Ubuntu is not able to cope with some libraries that are needed.
"""So, GIMP 2.4.0 is on the way and when you are on gimpusers.com, look at this area on the screen."""
It’s a mirror of two mailing lists that gives lot of information about the GIMP.
"""First, the """"gimp user"""" mailing list and I recommend you to read that."""
"""The """"gimp developer"""" list is above my head and perhaps above yours too."""
And here is a discussion which answers a question and I didn’t know about that.
Let’s see it here.
The 1st question here is asked by Alex Burs and he asks: what the sample point tab did?
And I didn’t understand the question.
But I knew Alex because he tried to help me with providing the files for you and set up google site for me.
The answer here is from Tim Jedlicka & I know TIM too because Tim has big server in the internet and a big pipe through the internet. And we are just now in the process of setting up possibility for you to do
I’ll keep you informing about it & just look into the block at meetthegimp.org and look if you find a download icon there.
Here Tim answers the question of Alex.
And I thank both of you for this question and answer conversation here.
Tim writes that sample points are created similar to guide except you have to hold down the Ctrl key & you can create a sample point by placing the cursor in the measurement bar and holding down Ctrl key whil
And there are some further questions but I will go through them later.
I never had heard about that and I have to try it.
"""To do that, I started the GIMP and load the image into it which is prepared to know as My Ship in the Fog."""
"""Now, I shall go to the ruler on the left side, press the Ctrl key and pull the ruler out and you can see here that the mouse cursor changes to an eye dropper and I get two lines instead of one."""
Just leave the mouse button and Ctrl key and you get a point with number one (1) on it.
"""And when I pull out the ruler with the mouse button pressed and without pressing the Ctrl key, I get only one line here which is used for adjusting things on it."""
Let’s try to do the same procedure from the ruler on the top.
I press the Ctrl key and mouse button and pull down the ruler and release it here.
"""So, here I have number two (2) and number one (1) is already there but I can see no dialog here."""
"""So, click on the tool options and select the Color Picker from the toolbox but I don’t see anything here."""
"""But remember, there was a dialog mentioned in the files; so I click on File, go to Dialogs and here is a dialog called Sample Points."""
"""When you click on it, you have got here sample points for 1 and 2."""
And this is one method of getting color information about different points in the image.
And now I know a better way for getting the color information.
"""I can change here pixel to RGB and I get the values for Red, Green, Blue and Alpha is displayed in terms of percentage."""
"""Here, with pixel you see the actual numerical value of colors and when RGB is selected, you see here the Hex code for HTML and I can change RGB in HSV color model or in CMYK color model and I will cover that"
The next question is also related to color and the color picker.
I had mentioned in my podcast of ‘Ship in the Fog’ that you can take the color picker and get color information of the image and Glulio asks here how to get the color information of resulting color and not th
One way of that you just saw but there is a different way also.
"""I have the Color Picker selected and when I press Shift and click into the image, I get the current color information. And you see here the ship, the trees are white and also the sky which is not very satisf"
And it’s because I have selected  white background.
"""So, I go to Layers dialog and change it to the original Background layer in dialog and you see it's fully different color from what you see on the screen."""

There is another option here called Sample average and when you select it you get a large Color Picker and get an average of all the pixels in that area.
It’s good option for getting color information for noisy image where you have big difference between the single pixels.
Glulio has another tip for the GIMP.
"""If you use not only .xcf as a file name but xcf.pz2 or xcf.bz2, the GIMP compresses the image and you get a smaller file size."""
I don’t know if this works also on Windows machine and you have to try that.
Perhaps on Windows it would work if you name the file 'xcf.zip' but I don’t know if it is true.
Perhaps somebody should try it and post on the blog.
Another question comes from Dmitry.
He asks if I can increase the quality of the video by trying different codec.
But I didn’t find this codec H 264 for linux in a free version.
There is a commercial version but it’s too expensive for me.
This is just a hobby and I pay for uploading the stuff and it’s not much but I don’t want to spend money on this here.
"""But, I have a quality question for you."""
I am recording this in 800/600 pixels and scale it down to 640/480 pixels just because everyone does it and this way it works on Apple TV and so on.
My question to you is: Do you prefer the original file size 800/600?
The image is clearer and you could see it better.
The files get a bit larger and there are people out there who can’t really see this bigger files.
I will make a test file in 800/600 and upload it. Perhaps you can try it and give me some feedback.
"""I am very happy about the next comment here, from Rodrigo, who says that he is thinking not to buy photoshop but to take the GIMP for his graphic work."""
I got a question from Vitaly via email which says: Is there any way to use the Curve tool in a non destructive way??
"""Answer to this question is """"NO, not in GIMP""""."""
Photoshop can do that with this adjustment layer and there are lot of GIMP programmers who are working on that and trying to implement it.
"""But, up to now if you change your colors with Levels tool, it is in a way that you can’t undo your work without undoing all the steps you did after that."""
"""Another question is from Dudley and he came with """"tips from the top floor"""" to my podcast here and installed GIMP 2.2.17 on his computer and I would recommend him 2.3 or 2.4 released candidate because they"
"""And he is asking about a book """"Beginning GIMP: From Novice to Professional"""" by Akkana Peck and I have this book."""
It is really good if you are starting with the GIMP or you have a bit knowledge then it’s a very good book and it's hands on the book
and I can really recommend that book.
"""And if you want to buy it and you are staying in United States, I will put a link into the block where you can buy this book via offer and the shop owner gets some money out of that."""
"""Yesterday I got a nasty shock when I started my work again, after the summer break. And that should be shocking enough but I looked the 1st time in Meet the Gimp block with a Windows computer and in Internet"
And I was really shocked because all the images were blown up and nothing was fitting into the frames and so on.
"""As a last thing in the show, I have a link tip for you."""
"""The """"Photocast Network"""" is a greater source for photo podcast and I am already a member but I am not on the website."""
"""Check out the website. There is a podcast made by the members of the """"Photocast Network"""" and it is called """"Focus Ring"""" and just today episode 8 came out."""
And eventually Meet The Gimp will pop out here on the left side.
"""I want to ask you for a favor; spread the word about Meet The GIMP. And if you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org and  more information is available at http://meetthegimp.org."""
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create and edit multiple objects using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:  copy and paste objects"""
Duplicate and clone objects
Group and Order various objects
Multiple selection and invert selection
Clipping and Masking.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.48.4"
Go to Dash home and type Inkscape.
You can open Inkscape by clicking on the logo.
Let's open the Assignment_1.svg file that we created earlier.
I had saved it in my Documents folder.
First we will learn how to copy and paste an object.
"""To do so, we should first select an object. So, click on the pentagon."""
"""Now, press Ctrl + C on your keyboard to copy it."""
Now press Ctrl + V to paste the object. You can see a copy of the pentagon on the canvas.
There are 3 other ways of creating copies of objects.
"""In all these 3 methods, a copy of the object is created exactly above the original one."""
The first method is called Paste Special.
Recall that we had already pressed Ctrl + C to copy the object.
"""To paste the object in the exact location from where it was copied, press Ctrl + Alt + V keys."""
Move the copied object to see the original object right below it.
Let us move these two objects and keep it aside.
"""The second method is called Duplication. For duplication, we do not need to copy the object first."""
Select the pentagon and press Ctrl + D keys on your keyboard.
Now a duplicate pentagon is created exactly on the top of the original one.
Let us move the duplicated object to see the original one below it.
The changes made on the duplicated object does not affect the original object.
Let us check this by changing its color to green and reducing its size.
The third method is called Cloning.
Click on the ellipse and press Alt + D to create a clone.
"""As before, the cloned object is created exactly above the original one."""
Let us move it aside to make it visible.
Please note that the cloned object will always be linked to the original object.
The original object is also known as its parent.
"""Any modifications on the original object, that is, in size, color etc. will affect its clone."""
"""Let us check this by changing the original object's color to pink, rotating it and reducing its size."""
Observe that the exact same changes are replicated in the cloned object automatically.
"""To unlink the clone from the original object, first select the clone and then press Shift + Alt + D."""
"""Now, select the original object again and change its size."""
Observe that the cloned object does not get affected.
The short-cut icons for these operations are present in the command bar as shown.
"""To select multiple objects, hold the Shift key and click on the objects that you want to select."""
I will select one ellipse first. Then I will hold the Shift key and select the other ellipse.
Notice that both the objects are now selected.
We can now group them by pressing Ctrl + G keys together.
Notice the ellipses are now grouped as a single object.
You can move them around and you will notice that both the objects move together as one object.
Try resizing the group and you will notice that both the objects get resized proportionately.
Change the colour to blue and observe that both the objects change to the same colour.
What do we do if we want to change the properties of only one of the objects in a group?
"""To select an object within a group, press the Ctrl button and click on the object."""
"""By this action, we can enter inside the group and select individual objects."""
"""To exit the group, click anywhere on the blank space on the canvas."""
"""To un-group objects, first select the group and press either Ctrl + Shift + G keys or Ctrl + U keys."""
Now the ellipses are un-grouped.
The short-cut icons for these operations are present in the command bar as shown.
"""To select all the objects on the canvas, press Ctrl + A keys."""
"""To un-select all the objects, click anywhere on the blank space on the canvas."""
"""If we want to select all the objects except a particular one, we can use the Invert Selection option."""
"""Let's say, we want to select all the objects except the arrow."""
"""So, first click on the arrow. Now, go to Edit menu and click on Invert selection."""
Notice that all the objects in the canvas are now selected except the arrow.
"""Now, let us learn how to order the objects."""
Let me move the smaller pentagon on top of the larger pentagon.
"""Now, let us draw a star and keep it on top of the smaller pentagon."""
Select the smaller pentagon. Go to Object menu and click on Raise.
Notice the smaller pentagon is now raised and is above the star.
"""Now, click on the star. Go to Object menu. Click on Lower."""
"""Now, the star is moved down or lowered and the larger pentagon now appears above it."""
"""Now, let me click on the larger pentagon. Go to Object menu and click on Raise to top. Now the larger pentagon appears on top."""
Now again go to Object menu. Click on Lower to bottom. Notice the larger pentagon is now moved to the bottom.
We can find these options in the Tool controls bar too.
"""Next, let us learn how to do Clipping."""
Clipping can make your complicated objects conform to another element or shape of your design by changing their entire shape quickly and easily.
"""I will use an image for this demonstration. I have an image here, in a new Inkscape file."""
"""On this image, I will draw an ellipse shape."""
"""Now, select the image and the ellipse."""
Go to Object menu. Click on Clip and then on Set.
Notice that the image is now clipped to the shape of the ellipse.
"""In Clipping, the shape of the object used as a clip defines the area that is visible."""
We can remove the clip by going back to Object menu.
Click on Clip and then click on Release.
Now the clip is released.
"""Next, let us learn to do Masking."""
Masking is very similar to Clipping.
"""In Masking, the transparency or lightness of one object determines the opacity of the second object."""
"""To demonstrate Masking, I will first make the ellipse semi-transparent using the gradient tool."""
"""Now, select the ellipse."""
Go to Object menu. Click on Fill and stroke.
Click on Radial gradient and then on Edit.
Move the RGB sliders to the extreme right to change the color to white.
Click on the Stop drop-down arrow and select the other stop.
Move the RGB sliders to the extreme left to change the color to black and change the alpha value to 255.
Click on Add stop to add one more color in between.
Click on the Node tool and move the diamond handle towards the top.
"""Now, select the image and the ellipse."""
Go to Object menu. Click on Mask and then on Set.
Observe that the mask is formed on the image.
Notice that the image takes on the transparency properties of the masking object which is the ellipse.
"""To remove the mask, go back to Object menu."""
Click on Mask and then on Release.
The mask is now removed.
Let us summarize.
"In this tutorial, we learnt to: Copy and paste objects"
Duplicate and clone objects
Group and Order various objects
Multiple selection and invert selection
Clipping and Masking.
Here are 2 assignments for you-
Create a vertical ellipse in grey color and a circle in black color.
Place the circle centrally on top of the ellipse.
It should look like an eye shape.
Now group them.
Next create a clone to make another eye.
Move it to the side to make both the eyes visible.
Create a circle in blue color and a square in red color.
Duplicate the square and keep both the squares in diagonally opposite direction.
Select both the squares and group them into a single object.
Place the circle centrally on top of the grouped squares.
Select both and create a clip. It should look like a bow.
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Getting to know Computers.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about"""
the various components of a computer.
We will also learn to connect the various components.
"""Generally, there are 2 types of computers -"""
Desktop  or Personal Computer and Laptop.
"""Now-a-days, tablet PCs or tabs for short, are also quite popular."""
Functions of a computer-
A computer performs five major functions irrespective of its size:
It accepts data or  instructions by way of input
It processes data as required by the user
It stores data
It gives results in the form of output
It controls all operations inside the computer.
Basic organization of a computer is as shown in this block diagram.
"""Input unit , Central Processing unit ,"""
' Output unit .
The Input unit helps to
enter the data and programs into a computer system in an organized manner.
"""Keyboard, mouse, camera and scanner are some of the input devices."""
The  Central Processing unit
performs operations like arithmetic and  logical operations and
stores data and instructions.
"""Typically, the  Central Processing unit or CPU looks like this."""
It has many  ports in the front and at the back of the unit.
We will learn about them in a little while.
"""It takes data and instructions, processes them and gives the output or results."""
The task of performing operations is called processing.
The output is then stored along with the data and  instructions in the storage unit.
"""The unit that supports the process of producing results from the data, is the output unit."""
Monitor and printer are some of the output devices.
"""Generally, a desktop computer has 4 main components:"""
Monitor CPU
Keyboard and Mouse .
"""A  camera, printer or scanner can also be connected to a computer."""
This is a monitor or the computer screen as we call it.
It looks like a TV screen.
It is the visual display unit of a computer.
It displays the computer's user interface.
One can open various programs and interact with the computer using the keyboard and mouse.
"""The  keyboard is designed to enter text, characters and other commands into a computer."""
This is the computer mouse.
"""Typically, it has 2 clickable buttons and a scroll button in between."""
"""Pressing the  left mouse button, activates most actions."""
"""Pressing the  right mouse button, activates more non-standard actions like shortcuts."""
The mouse wheel is used to scroll up and down by rolling the scroll button.
The  computer mouse is an alternative way to interact with the computer besides the  keyboard.
"""Now, let us see the various parts of the CPU."""
There is a prominent button on the front of the CPU which is the  POWER ON switch.
"""To turn on the computer, one needs to press this switch."""
"""There is a reset button too which helps us to restart the computer, if required."""
"""Also, on the front side, you will notice 2 or more  USB ports and a  DVD/CD-ROM reader-writer."""
The  USB ports are used to connect  pen-drives to the  computer.
And the  DVD/CD-ROM reader-writer is used to read or write a  CD or a DVD.
Now let's look at the back of the  computer.
"""The ports at the back, are used for connecting the CPU to the other devices of the computer."""
This is done using the cables.
There are many components inside the 'CPU'.
"""When the computer is ON, all these components work and generate heat."""
"""Fans at the back, provide the air flow required to cool the components."""
"""Otherwise, overheating can cause damage to the 'CPU', often leading to data loss."""
This is the case cooling fan.
It keeps the temperature of the CPU normal and prevents overheating.
"""Power Supply Unit, also called PSU, supplies power to the computer."""
"""Now, let's learn how to connect the various components to the CPU."""
"""Place all the components on the table, as shown."""
"""Place all the cables on the table, as shown."""
"""First, let's connect the monitor to the CPU."""
Connect the power cable to the  monitor as shown.
"""Now, connect the other end to a power supply socket."""
This is the power cable of the CPU.
Connect it to the CPU as shown.
"""Then, connect it to a power supply socket."""
"""Next, connect the  keyboard cable to the CPU as shown."""
The port  for the  keyboard is usually “purple” in colour.
You can connect the mouse to the port which is “green” in colour.
"""Alternately, you can connect the  USB keyboard and mouse to any of the USB ports."""
"""The remaining  USB ports can be used for connecting  pen drive, hard disk etc."""
This is a  LAN cable
and this is a LAN port.
It is a  wired connection that allows a computer to connect to a network.
The other end of the  LAN cable is connected to a   modem or a wi-fi router.
You will learn about configuring  wi-fi connections in another tutorial.
The  LED light will blink when the  LAN port is active and receiving activity.
You may notice that there are other serial ports on the CPU.
"""These are used for connecting  PDAs, modem or other serial devices."""
You will also notice that there are some parallel ports on the CPU.
"""These are used for connecting devices like  printer, scanner etc."""
"""Now, let's look at the audio jacks."""
The port in “pink” is used for connecting a microphone.
"""The port in “blue” is for connecting a line in, for eg- from a radio or tape player."""
The  port in “green” is for connecting headphone/speaker or line out.
"""Now that we have connected all our devices, let's turn on the computer."""
"""First of all, switch on the power supply buttons of the monitor and the CPU."""
"""Now, press the  POWER ON button on the monitor."""
"""And then press the  POWER ON switch, on the front of the CPU."""
"""Usually, you will see a string of words on a black screen when your computer first turns on."""
This is the BIOS system displaying information about
"""the computer's central processing unit,"""
"""information about how much memory the computer has,"""
and information about the hard disk drives and floppy disk drives.
BIOS is the software which gives the CPU its first instructions when the computer is turned on.
The whole process of loading the operating system is called booting the computer.
"""When all the necessary checks are done, you will see the operating system's interface."""
"""If you are an Ubuntu Linux user, you will see this screen."""
"""And if you are a Windows user, you will see this screen."""
"""Now, let us briefly look at a laptop."""
Laptops are portable and compact computers.
A laptop is small and light enough to sit on a person's lap while in use.
"""Hence, it is called a 'laptop."""
It has most of the same components as a  desktop computer including-
"""a display, a keyboard,"""
"""a  touchpad which is the pointing and navigating device,"""
a  CD/DVD reader-writer and
mic  and  speakers built into a single unit.
It also has a lan port  and  USB ports.
There is a  video port using which one can connect a  projector to the laptop.
The audio jacks are easily identifiable with respective icons for mic and headphones.
This is the inbuilt cooling fan in the laptop.
This helps to keep the laptop from overheating.
A  laptop is powered by electricity via an  AC adapter and has a rechargeable battery.
"""Hence, it is portable and can be used away from a power source."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
about the various components of a  desktop and  laptop
and how to connect the various components of a desktop.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Function calls in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about type of function calls namely-"""
call by value call by reference.
We will do this through an example.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with the introduction to function call by value.
It is a method of passing arguments to the function.
"When we pass a variable by value, it makes a copy of the variable before passing to the function."
"""Changes made to the arguments, inside the function, will remain in the function."""
It will not be affected outside the function.
Let us see a program on 'function call by value'.
I have already typed the program on the editor. I will just open it.
Please note our file name is callbyval.c.
"""In this program, we will calculate the cube of a number. Let me explain the code now."""
Here we have function cube having an argument as int x. .
"""In this function, we calculate the cube of x and return the value of x."""
"""Here we give the value of n as 8, 'n' is an integer variable."""
Then we call the function cube.
And print the value of 'n' and the cube of n.
And this is our return statement.
"""open the terminal window by pressing  Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile , type gcc space callbyval.c space hyphen o space val. Press Enter."""
"""Now, type ./val (dot slash val). Press Enter."""
The output is displayed as: Cube of 8 is 512.
Now we will see 'function call by reference'.
Let us go back to our slides.
It is another method of passing arguments to the function.
This method copies the address of the argument instead of the value.
"""Changes made to the arguments, inside a function, can affect them outside."""
In this we need to declare the arguments as pointer type.
Let us see an example on function call by reference.
Note that our file name is callbyref.c.
This is our header file as stdio.h.
Then we have function swap.
This function will exchange the values of the variables.
Value of 'a' will be stored in value of 'b' and vice versa.
You can see that the arguments passed in the function are pointer type.
Here we have declared an integer variable t.
"""First, value of 'a' is stored in 't'."""
Then value of 'b' is stored in 'a'.
And then value of 't' is stored in 'b'.
"""Like this, the values are exchanged."""
Here we have declared two integer variables as i and j.
Then we take the values of i and j as user inputs.
Ampersand i (&i) and Ampersand j (&j) will give the memory address of i and j.
"""First, we print the values before swapping."""
Then we call the function swap.
And then we print the values after swapping.
Switch back to our terminal.
To compile type gcc space callbyref dot c space hyphen o space ref. Press Enter.
Now type dot slash ref. Press Enter.
"""We see, 'Enter the values'. I will enter as 6 and 4."""
The output is displayed as: Before swapping 6 and 4
After swapping 4 and 6.
Now let us see how to execute the same program in C++.
"""I have the code, lets go through it."""
"""This is the second program, function call by reference ."""
Note that our file name is callbyref.cpp
Let us go through the code.
This is our header file as iostream .
Here we are using the std namespace.
The function declaration is same in C++.
In this we pass the arguments as ampersand x and ampersand y.
This will give the memory address of x and y.
Then we swap the values.
Rest of the code is similar to our C code.
The printf statement is replaced by cout and the scanf statement is replaced by cin.
Now let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile type, g++ space callbyref.cpp space hyphen o space ref1, press Enter."""
"""Now, type  dot slash ref1. Press Enter."""
Here it is displayed as:
Enter values of a and b
I will enter as 4 and 3.
The output is displayed.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Let us go back to our slides.
"""Let us summarize, In this tutorial we learnt:"""
Function call by value.
And Function call by reference.
"""As an assignment,write a similar program to calculate the cube of a number, using call by value in C++."

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Report Writing in LaTeX. I am calling it “latek” and not “latex”.
My name is Kannan Moudgalya.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to write a document."""
"""In particular, how to use ‘report’ and ‘article’ class, How to create sections, Automate the numbering of sections, Create Table of contents and How to create the title page."""
"""I am creating this tutorial on our less than 10,000 Rupee laptop."""
"""And, I am using Ubuntu Linux, TeXworks and LaTeX."""
You can also use TeXworks on Windows or Mac - the method is identical.
"""You can use LaTeX by itself, without TeXworks also."""
You are welcome to use more expensive Linux computers also!
"""The prerequisites to learn this are the following: Spoken tutorials that introduce LaTeX, The file ‘report dot tex’, Knowledge of the side-by-side method required to practise this tutorial."""
Information on all of the above are available on our website: spoken tutorial dot org.
Let me go to the TeXworks window.
I have already opened the file report.tex. Please download this file and practise along with me.
"""I am using 12 point as the font size, ‘a4 paper’ and ‘article’ class."""
"""I am using the geometry package to set margins, through the 'usepackage' command."""
A reverse slash should come at the beginning of every command.
"""Although I will not say it explicitly, you should not forget to put the reverse slash."""
"""Similarly, I will not explicitly mention braces, but you may have to use them."""
Please reproduce exactly what is done in the video.
The usepackage command has optional parameters inside square brackets.
The name of the package is within braces.
I have set horizontal and vertical margins of 4.5 cm each.
Look at the top left hand corner of the 'TexWorks’ window.
"""In case 'pdfLaTeX’ is not already chosen, please select it from the pull down menu."""
"""To the left, there is a green circle with an arrow."""
Click the arrow and compile this file.
We get the file ‘report.pdf’ shown on the right hand side.
"""Look at the titles - section, sub-section and sub-sub-section in the output file."""
These are created using identical commands given in the source file.
Observe the distinctive features of these section titles in the 'pdf' file.
The sizes of these titles are created proportionately and automatically.
"""Also, the section title is the largest and the sub-sub-section title is the smallest."""
"""Irrespective of blank lines in the source file, the output remains the same."""
Let me delete one line here. Compile.
There is no change here.
Let me now change the paper size to a5.
This will reduce the width of every line in the output.
Let me compile the text as we did before.
Let me magnify it by pressing control + so that you can see the output clearly.
Let me bring it to the centre.
"""For the rest of this tutorial, we will use the a5 paper only.  You are welcome to change it to a4."""
Note that I did not save the file. This is because TexWorks saves the file automatically before compilation.
Let us change the font to a smaller one of 10 point and compile.
"""Hey, the font size has become smaller - should we be surprised?  But, proportional sizing and spacing remain the same."""
Let me change the font back to 12 point.
We will now discuss another important aspect of section titles.
It is the automatic generation of section numbers.
"""To illustrate this further, I will add a new section called ‘Inserted section’."""
"""On compilation, it appears here with a correct number in sequence. Thus, numbering also is automatically taken care of by LaTeX."""
LaTeX creates table of contents through a file with extension “toc”.
"""Let me add ‘table of contents’, one word, here."""
Compile.
The word ‘Contents’ appears in the output but nothing else.
Let me compile once again.
All the titles are now present in the table of contents along with page numbers.
You have to compile it the third time to get the correct page numbers.
Why three times? Please see the assignment.
"""Just one word, ‘table of contents’, is what is needed."""
What an amazing capability in LaTeX!
This is achieved through a file with extension “toc” that LaTeX maintains.
This multi pass compilation procedure works with changes in titles as well.
Let me change the section title to ‘Modified section’.
Let me compile it. Table of Contents does not change.
Let me compile it once more and solve this problem.
Now we have a modified section here.
"""We will create a title for this document. Let me do it here, just before ‘begin document’."""
"""I will create a ‘title’, ‘Author’ information and the ‘date’ as follows."""
"""So, I have added these three commands."""
Order in which these come or the place where they come does not matter.
But they should come before the begin document command.
Don’t forget the reverse slash in all the commands.
Double slash here means the next line. We compile it.
There are no changes in the ‘pdf’ file.
The reason is that I have not told LaTeX what to do with this information.
"""So, I add the ‘make title’ command, one word, just after the 'begin document'."""
Let me compile it.
"""The title appears in the output, at the place where I put this command"""
"""namely, at the beginning of the document."""
We will now change the class of this document from article to report.
"""Simultaneously, we define a chapter with this command: 'Chapter First Chapter'."""
Report style requires at least one chapter.
Let us compile it and see the output.
Notice the changes in the output.
Title appears on a whole page that has no number.
"""Contents also appear on an entire page, with page number 1."""
Please pause here and find out how many entries in 'Contents' are wrong.
Let us go to the next page. Notice the way the chapter begins.
How many distinguishing features can you identify? You should find at least five.
Let us compile it for the second time.
Observe that the Contents page now has the correct information. The page numbers are correct now.
"""Let us add a chapter, called ‘New Chapter’."""
Compile it.
Let me compile once again and see it coming on a new page.
Insert the command appendix before this new chapter.
"""On compilation, you see the word “Appendix” appearing."""
The chapter number is A.
Let us go to the slides now.
Let us summarize what we learnt in this tutorial.
"""Writing a document in LaTeX, Automatically creating chapter and section titles, Automatic numbering, Table of contents and title page creation,  Creating Appendix."""
Let me give some assignments.
This assignment is on a4 paper and letter paper.
"""Please pause the video, read the slide and do the assignment."""
This assignment is on font size.
This is on report dot toc.
This is on number of compilations.
This is on the location of Table of Contents.
This assignment is on the use of the 'chapter' command in 'report' and 'article'.
This assignment is on the effect of the 'appendix' command in the 'report' class.
"""This is the same as the previous assignment, but in the 'article' class."""
This is on the geometry package.
"""This assignment is on LaTeX classes, in general."""
"""With this, we have come to the end of this tutorial."""

"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
Now let's start with today's tutorial.
It's about Curves.
Let me first activate the Curves tool in the tool box and then click in the image.
"""You can see, there is a histogram in the Curves tool and here are two bars with a gray scale."""
"""Then there are some buttons to select in the Curves tool like Preview, Save, Open etc."""
"""But for now, we will concentrate on the gray scale bar of the Curves tool."""
This bar here shows the different colour range of the source image.
"""And in this bar, we have some pixels which are really dark and some pixels which are really bright and in between there are pixels from dark to light."""
This horizontal bar here consists of 256 different colour tones.
The initial point on this bar is zero which is black and on end point it’s 255 which is white.
"""And for example, this here 184 is gray."""
This image consists lot of colours and I can show you the different colours here by changing the Channel.
Let’s select red in the colour Channel and you can see the red tones in the image.
"""Similarly, you can change it to green and blue to get the respective tones."""
"""And in this image, it’s not very surprising that the green channel is dominant channel which has lot of values in it."""
Now click on Reset Channel.
The curve of the histogram above each tone is the count of the pixel which have luminosity.
And we have an area here where there are almost same number of pixels with this terminal and this terminal on the bar.
The histogram shows that here is the highest colour range.
"""You go into the image when the Curves tool is active and the mouse cursor changes to a little dropper. When I click here, the line in the histogram shifts to that point."""
You can click into the image and move around to know which tone is where in the image.
Now we have covered horizontal bar here.
"""And this, here, is the output."""
And here are also 256 different values and they form the image.
Horizontal bar contains the data which is put into the curve and vertical bar contains data that is put out.
This line in between which crosses the graph is the translation function.
When I go up from mid gray to the translation curve and then when I go to the vertical bar on left I hit again to mid gray.
I can pull this curve as I want to and when I pull it down you see that the image gets darker.
"""And now when I go up from mid gray to the curve and then go to left, I land at dark gray."""
You see it here that the lower bar here is the original input and the vertical bar is the output of the Curves tool.
I can change this curve in lot of different ways which has nearly no limits.
One limit is that I can’t pull the curve backwards and the moment I do that the point on the Curves tool is lost.
"""But, if I don’t want to see any bright pixels in the image, so I can pull all the points down and then the image is nearly black."""
Just pull this point up here and you can get some bright stuff here.
You can play around with the Curves tool until you get images that have been in fashion for years ago.
We can restart the curve by clicking on the Reset button and get the original curve.
There are some more buttons in the Curves tool like Linear Mode and Logarithmic Mode.
"""In Logarithmic mode, you get the smaller values pushed up."""
"""Here in Linear mode, this line has double value from this line here."""
"""In Logarithmic mode this line can be 1, this 10, this 100 and this 1000."""
Each step gives you 10 times more value and with this you see the small pixels which in Linear mode are hidden.
you see it in this corner; you can’t say if there are pixels which have value more than 250.
"""But in Logarithmic, you see we have pixels over the full range of the image."""
"""Then here, there is a button called Curve Type. Up to now I used the tool here where the curve gets the curve and when I change the curve type, I can actually paint the curve and get some really funny stuff"
Then there is Save dialog and Open dialog button.
When you finish with changing the curves you can save it for later use and recall it whenever you want to.
I know a guy who shoots weddings a lot and he has a special bright shot curve which is fine tuned in white to give structure to the white dress.
How do I use Curves tool in this image?
I want to get the dark part of the image a bit darker.
I want to keep the mid terms as it is and I want to have bright part a bit brighter.
"""And to do this, I think, I will use the ‘S’ curve."""
I just pull the curve in the lower part a bit down and you can see that the dark part gets darker and I go to the bright part and push the curve up and make the bright part brighter.
You can pull the curve a bit up for more brightness.
"""When I click OK, the values of the curves are stored."""
"""And when I repeat this process here, you can see that the histogram has changed."""
"""There are no values in between here with no pixels and when I click on Logarithmic mode, there also you can see no values for certain pixels."""
"""Each time when you use Curves tool, you lose some pixels in the image."""
"""So, don’t try to undo the curve operation by doing the opposite i.e by pulling the curve up here and pulling down here."""
Click OK and now you can see that it gets worst and worst and you end in a image with a colour banding.
"""So, use the curves tool only to make one change and use it with care. Otherwise you end up losing the pixels in the image and you get an image colour banding in it."""
I think this was it for this tutorial.
And I hope to see you around for the next tutorial.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Relational Operators in Java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the"""
"""boolean data type,Relational operators and"""
how to compare data using Relational operators.
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of data types in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our  website as shown."""
Relational operators are used to check for conditions.
Their output is a variable of boolean data type.
A   boolean data type is of size  1 bit.
It stores only two values.
true or false.
true is the output when the condition is true.
false is the output if the condition is not true.
Here is a list of the relational operators available.
greater than
less than equal to
greater than or equal to less than or equal to
not equal to
We shall look into each of them in detail.
Switch to Eclipse.
Here we have the Eclipse IDE and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
I have created a class BooleanDemo and added the Main method.
Now let us add some expressions.
Type boolean b ;
The keyword boolean declares the data type of the variable b as boolean.
We shall store the result of our condition in b.
We shall define a variable weight and check for a condition using that variable.
int weight  equal to 45;
We shall check if the value in weight is greater than 40.
b  equal to weight  greater than 40;
This statement says: check if the value of variable is greater than 40 and store the result in 'b'.
"""Now, let us print the value of 'b'."""
System  dot  out dot  println(b);
"""As we can see, the output is True."""
Let us see what happens if the value is less than 40.
Change weight to 30.
Save and run.
We can see that the output is False as expected.
"""This way, the greater than symbol is used to check if one value is greater than the other."""
"""Similarly, less than symbol is used to check if one value is less than the other."""
Let us change the greater than to less than symbol.
"""So, We are checking if the value of weight is less than 40."""
"""Save, Run."""
"""As we can see, the output is true as expected."""
Let us change the value of weight to 45 and see the output.
We see that we get a false because the condition
weight less than 40 is not true.
Now let us see how to check if a value is equal to another.
"""To do that, we use two equal to symbols."""
Change less than symbol to double equal to.
"""As we can see, the output is false because the value of weight is not equal to 40."""
Now let us change the weight to 40 and see the output.
Save and  Run.
"""As we can see, the output is True."""
"""This way, double equal to is used for checking equality."""
"""Please be careful because, often people use a single equal to symbol for checking equality."""
And this gives unnecessary errors.
Next we'll see how to check for less than or equal to.
"""To do that, we will use a less than symbol followed by an equal to symbol."""
"""Change the double equal to,  to less than equal to."""
The output is True as expected.
Now let us change the value of weight to see if the less than check is performed.
Change 40 to 30.
"""We see, that although the weight is not equal to 40 we get the output as True because it is less than 40."""
Let us see what happens if the value of weight is greater than 40.
Let's say 50. Save and Run.
"""As we can see, the output is False   because the value of weight is not equal to 40."""
And it also not less than 40.
"""Similarly, we use a greater than symbol followed by an equal to symbol for checking greater than or equal to."""
Let us try it.
Change less than equal to to greater than equal to.
"""As we can see, the output is true  because weight is greater than 40."""
Let us change weight to a value less than 40. Let's say 30.
We get a false because the value of weight is not greater than 40 and also not equal to 40.
"""Next, we’ll see how to check for not equal to."""
It is done by using an exclamation mark followed by an equal to symbol.
Change greater than to exclamation.
"""So, this statement says: check if the value of weight is not equal to 40 and store the result in b."""
"""As we can see, the output is true because the values of weight is not equal to 40."""
Let us change the weight to 40 and see the output.
Change 30 to 40.
We get a false because the condition weight not equal to 40 is false.
The not equal to condition can be thought of as opposite of equal to condition.
This is how we use the various relational operators to compare data in Java.
"""In this tutorial we have learnt about: the boolean data type,"""
the relational operators and
how to use relational operators to compare data.

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on Variables and operators in awk command.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about- User defined variables,"""
"""Operators,  BEGIN and END statements."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 16.04"""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the earlier Linux tutorials on this website."""
You should be familiar with basic operators used in general programming languages like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
awk combines the power of a filter and a programming language.
"""So, it supports variables, constants, operators etc."""
Let’s see what a variable in awk is.
A variable is an identifier that references a value.
Awk supports both user-defined variables and built-in variables.
We will learn about user-defined variables in this tutorial.
"""For user-defined variables, variable declaration is not required."""
Variables do not have to be initialized explicitly.
Awk automatically initializes them to zero or null string.
"""A variable must begin with a letter and continue with letters, digits and underscores. Variables are case-sensitive."""
"""So, Salary with capital “S” and salary with small “s” are two different variables."""
Let us look at some examples now.
Open the terminal by pressing CTRL + ALT and T keys.
"""On the terminal, type- awk space opening single quote opening curly brace small x equal to 1 semicolon capital X equal to within double quotes capital A semicolon small a equal to within double quotes awk se"
"""Type: print x, press Enter."""
"""print capital X, press Enter."""
"""print a, press Enter."""
"""print b, press Enter."""
"""print a space b, press Enter."""
"""print small x space b, press Enter."""
print small x plus capital X closing curly brace closing single quote and press Enter.
"""Since we have not given a filename, awk would need some input from standard input."""
"""And hence, we can type any letter, say a and then press Enter."""
This example shows a couple of things. Variables can be initialized with a number.
It can also be initialized with value as a single character or a string.
"""If the value is a character or a string, variable is initialized with value within double quotes."""
We can see the values of the variables.
Observe that small x and capital X are treated as different variables.
This proves that variables are case sensitive.
"""Also, it shows how two strings can be concatenated."""
Here variables small a and small b are concatenated.
"""So, string concatenation operator is simply a space."""
"""Similarly, when we concatenate small x which is a number and string b, x is auto-converted into string. And the concatenated output becomes 1tutorial."""
Why does the auto-conversion to string happen?
"""That's because awk finds a string concatenation operator space here, between x and b."""
"""Now, look at the output of small x plus capital X. Here, we have the arithmetic operator plus."""
"""So, X is auto-converted to numeric zero. And the addition output becomes numeric 1."""
"""Until now, we have seen a couple of operators. Let’s look at what other operators we can use."""
A variety of operators can be used in expressions.
Please pause the video here and take a look at all the operators mentioned here.
I assume you are familiar with these basic operators.
"""If not, then kindly visit our website for tutorials on operators in C and C++ series."""
I am not going to discuss the working of all these operators in detail.
Only exception is the string matching operator which may be new to you. Let us understand this with an example.
A file named awkdemo.txt has been provided in the Code files link. Please download it on your computer.
Switch to the terminal. Let us end the previous process by pressing Ctrl and D keys.
Let me clear the terminal.
"""Now, go to the folder in which you have saved the awkdemo.txt file using the cd command."""
Let us have a look at this file now.
Let's say we want to find the students who have passed but have marks less than 80.
"""In this case, we need to compare two different fields."""
"""For such situations, we can use awk's relational operators."""
These operators can compare both strings and numbers.
"""So, on the terminal, type: awk space hyphen capital F within double quotes vertical bar space within single quotes dollar 5 equal to equal to within double quotes Pass space ampersand ampersand space dollar"
"""This command shows a number of things. One, we compare a string with the fifth field."""
"""Second, we only compare the fourth field with a number."""
"""Third, we see that we can join two or more comparisons using ampersand operator."""
"""Instead of specific numbers or strings, we can also compare regular expressions."""
"""As we have seen in the slide, we have the tilde and the exclamation tilde operators for this purpose."""
"""Now suppose, we want to find computer science students who have passed."""
"""Since computers can have both a small and capital C, we would use a regular expression."""
We would type: awk space hyphen capital F within double quotes pipe symbol space within single quote dollar 5 equal to equal to within double quotes Pass ampersand ampersand space dollar 3 tilde slash within
"""If we want to negate the comparison, we can do so using the exclamation tilde operator."""
"""Say, now we want a list of all non-computer students who have passed."""
Use the up-arrow to get the previous command.
Next to dollar 3 add exclamation symbol and press Enter.
"""Next, let's count the number of blank lines in the same file."""
"""Open the file and check how many blank lines are there. So, it has 3 blank lines."""
"""Now to count the number of empty lines using awk, type: awk space within single quote within front slash caret symbol dollar space within curly braces x equal to x plus 1 semicolon space print x space awkdem"
We got 3 as our final answer.
The caret sign signifies start of a line while dollar signifies the end of a line.
"""Hence, an empty line would be matched by the regular expression caret-dollar."""
"""Note, we have not initialized the value of x. Awk has initialized x to the initial value zero."""
"""This command gives us the running count of blank lines. This is because, every time a blank line is found, x would be incremented and then printed."""
"""In our last command, we have seen running count of blank lines. But, say we only want to print the total number of blank lines."""
"""Then we need to print x only once, after the entire file has been traversed."""
We may also want to give a heading saying what the output means.
"""For such requirements, awk provides the BEGIN and the END sections."""
The BEGIN section contains procedures for pre-processing.
This section is executed before the main input loop is executed.
The END section can contain procedures for post-processing.
This section is executed after the main input loop has terminated. The BEGIN and END procedures are optional.
"""Let's learn how to do this. In the terminal, type: awk space opening single quote BEGIN in caps within curly brace print space within double quotes The number of empty lines in awkdemo are  press Enter."""
within front slash caret symbol dollar symbol space within curly braces x equal to x plus 1  press Enter.
end space within curly braces print space x close single quote space awkdemo.txt and press Enter.
"""See, we did not get the desired output! We should get the output as 3 because we have 3 blank lines in the file."""
"""What do you think happened? Actually, we should have written end as upper case END."""
"""So, let us modify the command."""
Press the up-arrow key to get the previous executed command on the terminal.
"""Now, modify lower case end to upper case END.  And press Enter."""
Now the total number of empty lines is displayed in the output.
"""Next, let's find the average salary of all the students that we found in the awkdemo.txt file."""
"""To get that, type the command as shown in the terminal and press Enter. And, we get the desired output."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: User defined variables in awk,"""
"""Operators,  BEGIN and END statements."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on parameterized constructor in java.
In this tutorial we will learn:
About a parameterized constructor.
And to create a parameterized constructor.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 OS Java Development kit  1.6 And  Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create a default constructor in java using eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown.http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
What is a parameterized constructor?
A constructor that has parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
It can have one or more than one parameters.
Let us now create a parameterized constructor.
"""So in the eclipse, I have   Student.java file."""
We created this file in the previous tutorial.
"""Now, inside the constructor we will give the variables their default value."""
So roll_number is equal to zero instead of ten.
And name is equal to null instead of Raman.
"""Then type System dot out dot println """"I am a  default constructor""""."""
"""So, we have created a constructor with no parameters."""
"""In java, such constructor is also called a default constructor."""
Now we will create another constructor.
"""So, type: Student parentheses."""
Inside parenthesis int the_roll_number comma String the_name.
"""So, what we have done is declared a constructor with parameters."""
The name of the constructor is  Student that is the class name.
"""Inside the parentheses, we have given two parameters to the constructor."""
We can give any number of parameters to the constructor.
"""Now, inside curly brackets type:"""
"""System dot out dot println """"I am a parameterized constructor""""."""
"""Then, roll_number is equal to the_roll_number."""
And name is equal to the_name.
"""So, we have created a   constructor with parameters."""
Now let's call this  constructor.
"""So, in the main method type: student stu2 equal to new student within parentheses 11 comma in double quotes Raju."""
Let's call the studentDetail  method.
"""So, type: stu2.studentDetail."""
We see the output on the console.
The default constructor is called first.
It initializes the variables to their default values.
Then the parameterized constructor is called.
It initializes the variables to the values that are passed as the arguments.
That is 11 and Raju.
Let us see how the parameterized constructor works.
"""When we call the parameterized constructor, we pass two values  to it."""
These are called arguments.
The value 11 is copied to the parameter the_roll_number.
And  the  value Raju is copied  to the parameter the_name.
Then the value of the_roll_number is assigned to roll_number.
And the value of the_name is assigned to name.
"""Hence,  in the  output  we see 11  and  Raju."""
Let us see the common errors when we call a parameterized constructor.
"""Suppose, we pass a single argument to the constructor."""
So remove Raju.
We get an error. It states that “The constructor Student with parameter (int) is undefined.”
"""So, the number of arguments must match the number of parameters."""
Here we can retype Raju and resolve the error.
"""Alternatively, what we can  do is define another constructor with a single parameter."""
Let us  do that.
"""So, Student within parentheses int r_ number."""
"""Inside curly brackets, type:   System dot out dot println"""
"""""""I am a constructor with a single parameter""""."""
Then roll_number is equal to r_ number.
Save the file.
We see that the error is resolved  when we define the constructor.
Let's  Run the program.
On the console we see that the roll number is assigned the value 11.
While name is null since the constructor takes only one argument.
Let us now call back our constructor with two parameters.
"""So, type Student stu3 is equal to new Student."""
11 comma Raju.
Then Stu3 dot studentDetail.
"""Suppose here we pass 11 as String,so add double quotes."""
We get an error.
It states that “The constructor Student String comma String is undefined.”
So even the data type of the argument must match with that of the parameter.
So now remove the quotes and Save the file.
Now we do not see an error.
So  Run the program.
In the output we see three constructors.
The first one is the default constructor.
The second one is the Constructor with one parameter.
And this third one is the Constructor with two parameters.
This is how we create parameterized constructor in java.
Why constructor?
The variables in a class must be initialized each time an instance is created.
It can be tedious to initialize all the variables.
"""So, java allows objects to initialize themselves when they are created."""
This is performed through the use of a constructor.
"""So in this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
To create parameterized constructor.
Functionality of parameterized constructor.
And the advantage of using constructor.
"""For self assessment, create a class Employee."""
Create constructors with different number of parameters.
"""It is supported by the National mission on Education through ICT, MHRD, Government of India."""

"""If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and open your Moodle site.
Login with your teacher username and password details.
We are now in the teacher dashboard.
"""In the navigation menu on the left, notice Calculus under My Courses."""
Click on the Calculus course.
We have already added announcements and some common course details earlier.
We will now add some additional course material.
All course material in Moodle are called Resources. These are material that a teacher uses to support learning.
"""Resources could be internal like lecture notes, books or external like Wikipedia links"""
Let’s begin. Click on the gear icon at the top right of the page and then on Turn Editing On.
Note you need to turn the editing on to make any changes to the course.

Here is another assignment for you. Add a new folder resource in Basic Calculus Add the reference files from the File Manager Refer to the Assignment link of this tutorial for details.
"""The Spoken Tutorial Project Team conducts workshops and gives certificates.For more details, please write to us."""
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Admin’s dashboard in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: various blocks on the Admin’s dashboard,  Admin’s profile page and how to edit preferences."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04, Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30, Moodle 3.3  and Firefox web browser."""
You may use any web browser of your choice.
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
"""Learners of this tutorial should have Moodle 3.3 installed on their system. If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and open your moodle site. Make sure that the XAMPP service is running.
You can see a blank page with only the headers.  This is because we have not set any front page for our installation.
Click on Log in link at the top right corner of the window.
Log in using your admin username and password that you had given when you installed Moodle.
I will enter admin as the username and Spokentutorial1@ as the password.  Then click on Log in button.
The page that we see now is called the dashboard.
We can see that our dashboard is divided into 2 columns.
"""The wider one on the left, is the main Content column."""
The one on the right is the Blocks column.
Blocks are items in these columns that serve a specific purpose or information.
Blocks are found on all pages of Moodle. You can think of them as shortcuts to critical parts of your course.
"""For eg. Private Files, Online Users, Course Overview etc. are the blocks on my dashboard."""
Notice that there are no activities or courses here.
This is because we have not created any course yet.
A list of all courses will be seen- if a user (i.e a teacher or student or admin)  is enrolled or assigned a role in courses.
Also notice that the Online Users block shows Admin User which is our current login.
This block shows all the  logged in users at any given point of time.
Every block in Moodle has a specific purpose. We can add blocks to any column of any page in Moodle.
Let us now look at the header of the page.
"""On the top left corner, we can see a Navigation Drawer or Navigation menu. This helps us to access Calendar and other Administration links. This is a toggle menu"""
which means it changes its status from open to close and vice-versa when clicked.
We then have the placeholder for the logo.
"""By default, this is the short site name. Clicking on this, will get us to the dashboard from any page."""
"""At the top right, there are quick access icons for notifications and messages."""
Next to that is the drop-down user menu.  It is also called the quick access user menu.
"""We will discuss the Profile and Preferences page in brief, in this tutorial."""
"""All these menu items are also toggle menus, similar to the one on the left."""
"""Next, click on the Profile link."""
Every user in Moodle has a profile page.
"""It has links to   allow users to edit their profile information, view their forum or blog posts,"""
check any reports they have access to and view their access logs and the IP address that was used to login the last time.
Now let’s click on the Edit Profile link. The Edit Profile page opens up.
"""This page is divided into 5 sections: General, User Picture, Additional Names, Interests, Optional."""
"""The General section is expanded, by default."""
Clicking on any section name expands or collapses it.
"""The ‘Expand all’ link on the right, expands all the sections."""
All fields here are editable.
Let’s add City / Town. I will type Mumbai.
"""Ensure that India is selected in the Select a country drop-down. And, timezone is set to Asia/Kolkata."""
Only Admins can change password from this profile page.
Let me add a few fields in the Optional section.
"""I will enter IIT Bombay in the Institution field. Also, Mathematics in Department and a valid phone number in the Phone number field."""
Then click on Update Profile button to save the page.
"""Now, click on the quick access user menu at the top right, again. Click on the Preferences link."""
The Preferences page gives users quick access to various settings they may wish to edit.
"""Preferences page for an admin account is divided into 4 sections: User account, Roles, Blogs, and  Badges."""
The User Account section allows the user  to Edit Profile and Change Password.
"""It also sets preferences for Language, Forum, Calendar, Message, Notification etc."""
Let’s click on the Calendar preferences.
We will set the calendar to display time in 24 hour format.
"""Also, we will set the Upcoming events look-ahead to 2 weeks."""
This means we’ll see notifications for all events happening in the next 2 weeks on the calendar.
I want to highlight the help icon next to all the fields.
"""Clicking on this, will open a help box with a short description of what the field stands for."""
"""When in doubt about any field, always click on the help icon to understand its significance."""
Let all the other options remain as they are. Click on Save Changes button.
We will go through the rest of the preferences when we discuss those features later in this series.
Notice the information here.
"""This is the breadcrumb navigation. It’s a visual aid that indicates which page we are on, within the Moodle site’s hierarchy."""
It helps us to go back to a higher-level page with a single click.
Click on the Dashboard link in the breadcrumbs to go to the dashboard.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: various blocks on the admin’s dashboard, Admin’s profile page and how to edit preferences."""
Here is a small assignment for you. Click on the Message Preferences. Users in Moodle can send private messages to each other.
"""I do not want my messages to be delivered as email, even when I am offline."""
Look at the online and offline help box and ensure that the settings are correct.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Conditional statements in C and C++.
In this tutorial we will learn:
How to execute a single statement
How to execute group of statements.
We will do this through examples.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10 gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with the introduction to conditional statements.
A statement in a program controls the flow of program execution.
It helps to make decision on what code is to be executed.
"""We can check the conditions, whether true or false."""
We can execute a single statement or a group of statements.
Let us understand the flow of if statements.
"""Here, if the condition is true then statement 1 will be executed."""
If the condition is false then statement 2 will be executed.
Now we will see the flow of else if statement.
"""Here, if condition 1 is true then statement 1 will be executed."""
If condition 1 is false then it will check for another condition that is condition 2.
If condition 2 is true then statement 3 will be executed.
And If condition 2 is false then statement 2 will be executed.
Now Let us move on to our program.
I have already typed the code on the editor.
"""So, let me open it."""
Note that our file name is ifstmt.c.
In this program we will calculate the sum of two numbers and will check a few conditions.
Let me explain the code now.
This is our header file.
This is our main() function.
"""Here we have declared three integer variables a, b and sum."""
Here we are asking for user input.
User will enter the values of a and b.
The values will be stored in variable a and variable b.
The scanf() function reads data from the console.
It then stores the result in the given variable.
The format specifier in the scanf() helps to know the type of data.
"""Like here we have %d, it denotes that we are dealing with integer data type."""
Here we add the values of a and b.
We will store the result in sum.
Then we print the result.
This is our if statement.
"""Here, we check the condition whether sum is greater than 20."""
"""If the condition is true, then we print Sum is greater than 20."""
Now let me comment out these lines.
This is our return statement.
Now click on Save.
First we will see the execution of if statement.
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space ifstmt dot c space  -o space if and press Enter."""
"""To execute,  type ./if (dot slash if). Press Enter."""
It is displayed as Enter the values of a and b.
I will give the values as 10 and 12.
The output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 22. Sum is greater than 20.
Now come back to our program.
We will check another condition.
Let me remove the comment from here.
I will give the comment here.
This is our else-if statement.
"""Here, we check another condition whether Sum is greater than 10."""
If the condition is true then we print 'Sum is greater than 10 and less than 20'.
Now come back to our terminal.
Let us compile as before.
Let us execute as before.
It is displayed as Enter the value of a and b.
I will give the values as 10 and 2.
The output is displayed as: Sum of a and b is 12.
Sum is greater than 10 and less than 20.
Let me clear the prompt.
I will remove the comment from here and here. Now click on Save.
If both the above conditions are false then we print 'Sum is less than 10'.
This is our else statement.
Now let us execute and see.  Come back to our terminal.
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.
Here it is displayed as Enter the value of a and b.
I will give the values as 3 and 5.
The output is displayed as sum of a and b is 8. Sum is less than 10.
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across.
Come back to our program.
"""Suppose, here at the end of if statement I will type a semicolon (;)."""
Let us see what will happen. Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.
We see an error:  'else' without a previous 'if'
Come back to our program. It is a syntax error.
if statement will never terminate with a semicolon.
And the else if statement will never work without an if.
Let us fix the error. Delete the semicolon (;) here.
Now Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to the terminal.
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.
Enter the value of a and b.
I will give the values as 3 and 6.
The output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 9. Sum is less than 10.
NOW WE WILL SEE HOW TO EXECUTE THE SAME PROGRAM IN C++.
I will change a few things here.
"""Press Shift, Ctrl and S  keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with an extension dot cpp and click on  Save.
We will change the header file as iostream.
Let us include the using statement here.
Now click on the Search for and replace text option.
Let us replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
Click on Replace all and click on Close.
Now delete the closing brackets here.
Replace the scanf() statement with the cin statement.
Type cin and two closing angle brackets >>. As we use cin >> function to read a line in C++.
Now delete the format specifiers.
Delete the comma and ampersand &.
Delete the comma here and type two closing angle brackets.
Again delete the ampersandand the closing brackets. Now click on Save.
Here delete the closing bracket and the comma.
Now delete the backslash n () and format specifier.
Now type two opening brackets.
Again type two opening angle brackets  and within the double quotes type backslash n “”.
Here also we will delete the closing bracket.
Now again delete the closing bracket here and here.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute.
Come back to the terminal. Let me clear the prompt.
"""To compile, type g++ space ifstmt.cpp space -o space if1"""
Here we have 'if1' because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter if for the file 'ifstmt.c'.
Now Press 'Enter'.To execute type ./if1 (dot slash if1) and press Enter.
Enter the value of a and b. I will give the values as 20 and 10.
The output is displayed as Sum of a and b is 30. Sum is greater than 20
Now come back to our slides.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learned 'if' statement eg. if(condition),"""
And 'else if' statement eg. else if(condition).
"""As an assignment, Write a program to check 'a' is greater than 'b' or less than 'b'."""
Hint: use 'if' statement.
"""Write another program to check which value is greater 'a', 'b' or 'c'."""
Hint: use 'else-if' statement.

Welcome to this tutorial on Introduction to Biopython.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: important features of Biopython"""
Information regarding download and installation on Linux Operating System and translation of a DNA sequence to a protein sequence using Biopython tools.
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics and basic Python programming."
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu OS version 12.04"" Python version 2.7.3 Ipython version 0.12.1 and Biopython version 1.58."
Biopython is a collection of modules for computational biology.
It can perform most basic to advanced tasks required for bioinformatics.
Biopython tools are used for:
"""Parsing, that is extracting information from various file formats such as FASTA, Genbank etc."""
"""Download data from database websites such as NCBI, ExPASY etc."""
Run Bioinformatic algorithms such as BLAST.
It has tools for performing common operations on sequences.
"on, translation etc."""
Code for dealing with alignments and code to split up tasks into separate processes.
Information regarding download:
Biopython package is not part of the Python distribution; it needs to be downloaded independently.
"""For details, refer to the following link."""
Installation on Linux system:
"""Install Python, Ipython and Biopython packages using Synaptic Package Manager."""
Prerequisite software will be installed automatically.
Additional packages must be installed for graphic outputs and plots.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""I have already installed Python, Ipython and Biopython on my system."""
"""Start Ipython interpreter by typing """"ipython"""" and press Enter."""
IPython prompt appears on screen.
"""To check the installation of Biopython- at the prompt, type: """"import Bio"""",  press Enter."""
"""If you don't get any error message, it means Biopython is installed."""
"""Here, let me remind you, Python language is case sensitive."""
"""Take precaution while typing keywords, variables or functions."""
"""For instance, in the above line “i” in import is lowercase and “B” is uppercase in Bio."""
"""In this tutorial, we will make use of Biopython modules to translate a DNA sequence."""
It involves the following steps.
"""First, create a sequence object for coding DNA strand."""
"on of coding DNA strand to mRNA."""
"""Finally, translation of mRNA to a protein sequence."""
"""We will be using the coding DNA strand shown on this slide, as an example."""
It codes for a small protein sequence.
The first step is to create a sequence object for the above coding DNA strand.
Let us go back to the terminal.
"""For creating a sequence object, import the Seq module from Bio package."""
The Seq module provides methods to store and process sequence objects.
"""At the prompt, type: from Bio dot Seq import Seq  press Enter."""
"""Next, specify the alphabets in the strand explicitly, when creating your sequence object."""
That is to specify whether the sequence of alphabets code for nucleotides or amino acids.
"""To do so, we will use IUPAC module from Alphabet package."""
"""At the prompt, type: from Bio dot Alphabet import IUPAC.  Press Enter."""
"""Note that we have used import and from statements to load """"Seq"""" and """"IUPAC"""" modules."""
Store the sequence object in a variable called cdna.
"""At the prompt, type: cdna equal to Seq as in normal strings."""
Enclose the sequence within double quotes and parentheses.
"""We know our sequence is a DNA fragment. So, type: unambiguous DNA alphabet object as an argument."""
"""For the output, type: cdna. Press Enter."""
The output shows the DNA sequence as a sequence object.
Let’s transcribe the coding DNA strand into the corresponding mRNA.
We will use the Seq module's built-in “transcribe” method.
Type the following code:
Store the output in a variable mrna.
"""At the prompt, type: mrna equal to cdna dot transcribe open and close parentheses, press Enter."""
"""For the output, type:  mrna. Press Enter."""
Observe the output.The transcribe method replaces the Thiamin in the DNA sequence by Uracil.
"""Next, to translate this mRNA to corresponding protein sequence, use the translate method."""
Type the following code:  protein equal to mrna dot translate open and close parentheses. Press Enter.
"""The translate method translates RNA or DNA sequence using the standard genetic code, if unspecified."""
The output shows an amino acid sequence.
The output also shows information  regarding the presence of stop codons in the translated sequence.
Observe the asterisk at the end of the protein sequence. It indicates the stop codon.
"on."""
"""In Biopython, transcribe method works only on coding DNA strand."""
"on starts with a template strand."""
"""If you are starting with a template strand, convert it to coding strand by using reverse complement method, as shown on the terminal."""
"""Follow the rest of the code as shown above, for the coding strand."""
Using methods in Biopython we have translated a DNA sequence to a protein sequence.
DNA sequence of any size can be translated to a protein sequence using this code.
"""Let's summarize.In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
Important features of Biopython
Information regarding download and installation on Linux OS
Create a sequence object for the given DNA strand.
on of the DNA sequence to mRNA.
Translation of mRNA to protein sequence.
"""Now, for the assignment-"""
Translate the given DNA sequence into protein sequence.
Observe the output.
The protein sequence has an internal stop codon.
"""As it happens in nature, translate the DNA till first in-frame stop codon."""
Your completed assignment should have the following code.
Notice that we have used to underscore stop argument in the translate() method. Notice the output.
The stop codon itself is not translated.
The stop symbol is not included at the end of your protein sequence.

Inkscape version 0.48.4
"""This is a sample 3 fold brochure. As we open it, we can see the 3 folds."""
"""So, there are 6 sections in all."""
"""The outer side contains sections 1, 5 and 6."""
"""The inner side of the brochure contains sections 2, 3 and 4."""
Let us learn how to create a brochure like this one.
Open Inkscape.
Click on File and go to Document Properties.
Let's do some basic settings first.
Change: Default units to mm
Page Size to A4
Orientation to Landscape
Custom Size Units to mm.
We have to divide the canvas into 3 folds.
"""For that, observe that the width of the canvas is 297."""
"""So, we have to divide 297 into 3 parts which is 99 for each of the three sections."""
Close the Document Properties dialog box now.
Click and drag a guideline from the left side onto the canvas.
Double-click on this guideline.
A dialog box opens up.
Change the value of 'X' to 99 and click on OK.
Click and drag another guideline from the left side onto the canvas.
Double-click on it to open the dialog box.
"""Here, change the value of X to 198."""
Now our canvas is divided into 3 equal sections.
These guidelines tell us where each fold will start and end.
Let us save this file twice:
One for the inner side of the brochure
and the other for the outer side.
Go to File and click on Save as.
I will save the file on my Desktop with the name Brochure-OUT.svg.
Once again go to File and click on Save as.
"""This time, I will give the name Brochure-IN.svg and click on Save."""
"""So, now we have 2 files- one for the inner section and one for the outer section."""
Let us start with Brochure-IN.svg.
"""As we go about creating this brochure, it is desirable to use different layers for different elements."""
"""Towards the end of this tutorial, we see the benefits of doing so."""
"""Let us first design the inner sections of the brochure i.e. sections 2, 3 and 4."""
"""Using the Bezier tool, draw a graphic illustration in the middle of the canvas. Color it blue."""
Remove the stroke.
Create a new layer and name it as you prefer.
Create a circle of 150X150 pixels.
Color it green.
Duplicate the circle and create 5 more circles of different sizes as shown.
Place them around the graphic illustration as demonstrated.
"""Inside these circles, we will place some images."""
I have already edited the images to a circular shape and saved them in my Documents folder.
"""For your convenience, these images have been provided to you in the Code files link."""
"""Pause the tutorial, click on the link and save these images to your preferred location."""
"""After this, resume the tutorial."""
"""Go to File, click on Import and then on Image1."""
Keep it on top of the first circle.
"""In a similar way, repeat the steps for the other 5 images."""
Align them using Align and Distribute option.
"""Now, your canvas should look like this."""
Next create a new layer.
Select the Bezier tool and draw an arrow.
Color it gray.
Remove the stroke.
Go to Filters menu. Select Shadows and Glows and then click on Drop Shadow.
Check on Preview box to notice the effect.
Now click on Apply. Close the dialog box.
"""Keep it on the top of the first circle in an overlapping manner, as shown."""
Duplicate this arrow twice to create 2 more arrows.
"""Keep them on 2nd and 3rd circles respectively, as shown."""
"""Now, all the graphic elements are done."""
We will now insert the relevant texts.
"""On the new layer, type “Introduction” on the first arrow."""
Type Features on the second arrow.
Type Usage on the third arrow.
"""Now, we have to insert the text under each of these sections."""
I will copy and paste the texts from a LibreOffice Writer file that I have saved already.
This file is available to you in your saved folder.
Please locate it and copy the text from it.
Then paste it as shown on a new layer.
Reduce the font size to 15 and align them using Text and Font option.
Create a bullet of green color using the ellipse tool.
Place it to the right of the first sentence.
Repeat the same process for all the sentences.
Now the inner part of the brochure is ready.
Let's press CTRL + S to save our SVG file.
Now you can hide or show the layers that you want in the final brochure.
Let us now save the same file into PDF.
"""Go to File, click on Save As."""
Change the file extension to PDF.
Click on Save.
A new dialog box appears.
"""For printing purpose, the resolution must be 300."""
"""For web, it can be 72."""
Let me keep it as 300.
Now click on OK.
Let us now change the opacity of the arrows.
Go to the Arrow layer and change the opacity of the layer to 70.
I have also added a new layer with ink-blots.
Save the file in SVG and PDF formats.
Compare the 2 'pdf's to understand the difference.
"""Next, let us create the outer part of the brochure."""
Go to File. Click on Open.
Select Brochure-OUT.svg.
"""Now we have to design the sections 1, 5 and 6."""
"""Once again, remember to use different layers for different elements."""
Draw a graphic illustration on the top left using the Bezier tool as shown.
Color it blue. Remove the stroke.
Import Spoken Tutorial logo which is in your saved folder.
Reduce the size and place it on the top left corner of the 1st section.
Type Spoken Tutorial and align it to the right of the logo.
Change the font size to 25.
Draw a circle below the text and color it yellow.
Import Inkscape logo.
Place it on the top of the yellow circle.
Type “Inkscape” below the logo. Change the font size to 45.
I have added details about Spoken Tutorial project and inserted the relevant logos.
Please do so likewise.
I have aligned all the elements using
Text and font
and Align and Distribute options.
Now the outer side of the brochure is ready.
Go to File.  Click on Save As.
Change the format to SVG and click on Save.
Repeat the same process.
Change the extension to PDF.
This is our completed brochure.
If you have used layers for the various elements then you can conveniently change the colours and opacity.
These are 2 other colour schemes that I have created for the same brochure.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to:"""
Use guidelines and to set them
Design a 3-fold brochure.
We also learnt-the importance of using layers
and obtaining the same brochure in various colour schemes.
Here is an assignment for you-
Create a 3-fold brochure for Spoken Tutorial project.
Your completed assignment should look like this.
"""Spoken Tutorial Project is supported by the NMEICT, MHRD, Government of India."""
"""Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Using """"this"""" keyword in java."""
"""About use of """"this"""" keyword"""
"""To use """"this"""" keyword with fields"""
To use this keyword for chaining of constructors.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 jdk 1.6 Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
"""how to create a constructor in java, using eclipse."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
Now we will see the use of this keyword.
"""Within a constructor, """"this"""" is a reference to the current object."""
"""We can refer any member of the current object, within a constructor, using """"this""""."""
Now we will see the use of this keyword with fields.
this keyword helps us to avoid name conflicts.
We can see such an example here.
"""For that, let us open Eclipse."""
Open the Student class we had created in the earlier tutorial.
"""Comment the default constructor, comment the constructor with 1 parameter."""
Also comment the code for creating the first two objects.
"""Now, notice the parameterized constructor."""
the_roll_number and the_name are the arguments passed to the constructor.
roll_number and name are the instance variables.
"""Now, let me change the arguments to roll_number and name itself."""
So inside the constructor we have:
roll_number equal to roll_number and name equal to name.
"""Now Save and run the file. So press Ctrl, S and Ctrl, F11."""
We get the output as follows:
I am a parameterized constructor 0  null
Now come back to the code.
We see 2 warnings in the code.
Hover your mouse over the warning symbol.
We can see The assignment to the variable roll_number has no effect.
And The assignment to the variable name has no effect.
"""This is because, in the constructor, 'roll_number' and 'name' are local variables."""
Local variables are variables that are accessible within the method or block.
"""Here, 'roll_number' and 'name' will be initialized to 11 and """"Raju"""""""
"""because we have passed the values 11 and """"Raju"""" into the constructor."""
"""But once they come out of the constructor, it is not accessible."""
"""Then the only roll_number and name we know, are the instance variables."""
They have been initialized to '0' and null' already once the object is created.
So we got the output as 0 and null.
"""Now, let us make a small change inside the constructor."""
"""So, type: this dot roll_number equal to roll_number."""
"""And, this dot name equal to name."""
"""Now save and run the file. So press ctrl, S And Ctrl, F11 keys."""
We get the output as:
I am parameterized constructor 11 and Raju
This is because this dot roll_number and this dot name refer to the instance variables 'roll_number' and 'name'.
"""And here roll_number and name are the arguments, passed in the method."""
"""To avoid conflict between local and instance variables we use """"this"""" keyword."""
"""Now, we will see the use of """"this"""" keyword for chaining of constructor."""
We can use this keyword inside a constructor to call another one.
The constructors must be in the same class.
This is called explicit constructor invocation.
"""So, let us come back to the Student class which we created."""
Now remove the comments.
"""Now, comment the part to assign the instance variables to their values in the first two constructors."""
Then comment the part which creates the second and third objects.
"""Now, let us first come to the constructor with no parameters."""
After curly brackets type: this within brackets 11 and semicolon.
"""Inside the second constructor, type: this within brackets 11 comma within double quotes """"Raju"""" semicolon."""
"""Now, Save and Run the file. So, press Ctrl, S and Ctrl , F11."""
We get the output as:
I am a parameterized constructor
I am a constructor with a single parameter
I am Default Constructor 11 and  Raju
"""Now, I will explain the output."""
"""When the object is created, the respective constructor gets called."""
The constructor here is the no argument constructor.
The control comes to the first line in the constructor.
It encounters the this within brackets 11 statement.
Hence it calls the constructor that accepts single integer argument.
Then the control comes to this within brackets 11 comma Raju.
Hence it calls the constructor that accepts 1 integer and 1 String argument.
"""So, this constructor is executed and we get the output as I am a parameterized constructor."""
Now the instance variables will be initialized to 11 and Raju as we have passed.
"""Now, the control goes back to the calling constructor."""
"""So, the second constructor gets executed."""
We get the output as I am constructor with a single parameter.
"""Then, the control goes to the first constructor and executes it."""
"""So, we get output as I am a default constructor."""
Then studentDetail method is executed.
"""So, we get 11 and Raju."""
"""Now, let us make a small change."""
Make the this statement the last one in the constructor.
We get a compiler error.
Hover the mouse over the error symbol.
We get the error as:
Constructor call must be the first statement in a constructor.
"""So, we must make it the first line of the constructor."""
"""So, make it the first line of the constructor."""
Now we can see that the error has gone.
"""So, in this tutorial, we learnt:"""
The use of this keyword with fields.
To use this keyword for chaining constructors
How this keyword should be used within a constructor.
"""For self assessment, in the Employee class created earlier:"""
Create a constructor with two parameters.
Use this keyword to initialize the instance variables .
"""Also, create a constructor with 1 and no parameters."""
Try chaining the constructors using this as explained in the tutorial.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Instance fields in Java.
About instance fields
To access the instance fields of a class
Modifiers for instance fields
"""And, why instance fields are called so?"""
Here we are using:
Ubuntu version 11.10
jdk 1.6
And  Eclipse IDE 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create a class in Java using Eclipse.
You must also know how to create an object for the class.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
We know that objects store their individual states in fields.
These fields are declared without the  static  keyword.
We will learn about static fields in the coming tutorials.
Non-static fields are also known as instance variables or instance fields.
Let us go back to the Student class we had already created.
We can see that here roll_no and name are the instance fields of this class.
"""Now, we will learn how to access these fields."""
"""For that, let us open the TestStudent class which we had already created."""
We can remove the statement for creating the second object.
We will also remove the println statements.
"""Now we will access the fields, roll_no and name,  of the student class using stud1 and the dot operator."""
"""So, for that,  type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The roll number is then plus stud1 dot  from the option provided select ' roll_no' press Enter  then semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The name is plus stud1 dot select 'name' press Enter then semicolon."""
"""Now, save and run the file TestStudent.java. So press   Ctrl, S and Ctrl, F11."""
We get the output as:
The roll number is 0.
The name is null.
"""This is because, we have not initialized the variables to any value."""
"""In Java, the fields cannot have random values."""
"""After the memory is allocated for the object, the fields are initialized to null or zero."""
This work is done by the constructor.
We will learn about constructor in the coming tutorials.
"""Now, we will initialize the fields explicitly and see the output."""
"""So, type: int   roll_no equal to 50  next line String name equal to within double quotes Raju."""
"""Now, save and run the file. Press Ctrl, S and Ctrl, F11."""
We get the output as expected; The roll number is 50.
The name is Raju.
This is because we have explicitly initialized the variables  in the Student class.
We can see that here the fields have no modifier or  default modifier.
"""Recall modifiers, we had discussed in Creating Classes."""
We can access the fields because both Student.java and TestStudent.java are in the same package.
"""We can see that, here, they are in the same default package."""
We will learn about packages in the later tutorials.
We will now change the modifier to private.
"""So, before the field declarations, type: private. So, type: private space int roll_no=50;."""
"""Next line, private space String name = Raju;."""
Now save the file Student.java.
We can see that we get errors in TestStudent.java.
Hover the mouse over the error symbol.
It says The field Student  dot roll number is not visible.
And The field Student  dot name is not visible.
This is because private fields can be accessed only within its own class.
You can try accessing roll_no and name from the Student class itself.
You will find that you can access them without any error.
Now let us change the modifier to protected.
Now  Save the file and Run the program.
We see the output on the console. The Roll no is 50 The name is Raju.
This is because protected fields can be accessed within the same package.
Now let us see why  instance fields are called so?
Instance fields are called so because their values are unique to each instance of a class.
In other words each object of a class will have unique values.
Let us go back to the TestStudent class.
"""Here, we will create one more object of the Student class."""
"""So, type: next line, Student space stud2 equal to new space Student opening and closing brackets semicolon."""
We will now initialize both the objects in the TestStudent class.
"""So, next line, type: stud1 dot select roll_no  press  Enter equal to 20  semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: stud1 dot select  name press Enter equal to within double quotes Ramu  semicolon press Enter."""
Thus we have initialized the fields for the first object.
"""Now, we will initialize the fields for the second object."""
"""So, type: stud2 dot select roll_no equal to 30 semicolon."""
"""Next line, stud2 dot select name equal to within double quotes Shyamu  semicolon press Enter."""
"""Now, after the println statements, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The roll number is plus stud2  dot select roll_no and  semicolon."""
"""System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The name is, plus stud2  dot select name and semicolon."""
"""Now, save and run the file. Press  Ctrl, s and Ctrl, F11."""
"""We get the output as follows.  The roll_no is 20, The name is Ramu The roll_no is 30, The name is shyamu."""
"""Here, both stud1 and stud2 are referring to two different objects."""
This means that the two objects have unique values.
We can see that here.The first object has the values 20 and Ramu.
The second object has the values 30 and Shyamu.
"""Now, let us create one more object."""
So type Student space stud3 equal to new space Student  within brackets opening and closing brackets semicolon.
We will now print the values  of the third object.
"""So, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The  roll_no is plus stud3  dot select roll_no semicolon."""
"""next line, type:  System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The  name is plus stud3  dot name semicolon."""
"""Now, save and run the file. So press Ctrl, S and Ctrl, F11 ."""
We  can see that the third object contains the values 50 and Raju.
This is because we had explicitly initialized the fields of the Student class to 50 and  Raju.
"""Now, try de-initializing the fields and see the output for the third object."""
"""So in this tutorial, we learnt:"""
About instance fields.
Accessing the fields using dot operator.
"""For self assessment,"""
Create an  object emp2 in the TestEmployee class already created.
Then initialize the values of the two objects using dot operator.
Use 55 and Priya as values for first object.
Use 45 and Sandeep as values for second object.
Display the values for both the objects in the output.
Thus we have come to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on embedding mathematics in Xfig.
"""In this tutorial, I shall explain how to create this figure."""
Observe the mathematical expression in the second block.
You can embed any mathematical expression after learning this tutorial.
"""We shall create the figure in the previous slide, starting from this figure, which was created in the spoken tutorial on “Feedback Diagrams through Xfig”."""
You should learn this tutorial before starting the current one.
"""Let me now explain, what all you need to learn the material taught in this course."""
"""I am using Xfig Version 3.2, patch level 5."""
You also need LaTeX and a familiarity with it.
You also need image cropping software.
pdfcrop works on Linux and Mac OS X. We will cover it in this tutorial.
"""Briss is said to work on Windows also, but not covered in this tutorial."""
Let us go to Xfig.
"""Let us choose the File, then Open."""
"""If we scroll through the list, we will see the file “feedback.fig”, created in the spoken tutorial on “Feedback Diagrams through Xfig”. Let us click it."""
We will see the figure inside this box.
Let us open it.
Let us bring it inside.
Let us also zoom it.
"""Using the Save as option on “File”, we will save this figure as maths."""
Let us save it.
"""We now have the file """"maths.fig""""."""
Let us select “Edit” and click the text “Plant”.
Let me take the mouse here. Let me delete this and enter $G(z) = \frac z{z-1}$
Make sure that the mouse stays within the box while typing.
The default value for “Flag”' is “Normal” - change it to “Special”.
Click “Done”.
"""As the text is long, it overlaps with other entries."""
Let us move the text outside the box and work with it.
Let me click here.
Let me choose Grid Mode.
"""Once we are satisfied with any changes that we may want here, we can put it back inside the box."""
Let us save this file.
Let us export using combined pdf and Latex files.
File > Export > Combined pdf/LaTeX. Let us Export.
There is an error message that I get. But let us not worry about this.
Let me go to the terminal.
Let me type ls -lrt.
"""We get a list of files, with the last one being the most recent."""
The last two files are maths.pdf_t and maths.pdf.
Let us give the command open maths.pdf.
We can see the block diagram without the mathematical expression.
Let me close this.
Let us see maths.pdf_t in emacs editor that I have already opened.
It is here. Let me open it.
Please note that you do NOT have to use emacs.
You can use WHATEVER editor that you are comfortable with.
You can see  that the “picture” environment is used.
It also makes use of includegraphics and color packages – we need to tell LaTeX to take care of this requirement.
Let me now open the file maths-bp.tex; I have already created for this tutorial.
I have used article class.
"""I have used color and graphicx packages as these are used in the file pdf_t, the one we saw earlier."""
I want empty pagestyle as I do not want the page number.
"""Finally, I want to include the file maths.pdf_t."""
Let us invoke the command pdflatex maths-bp in the terminal.
We get the message that the maths-bp.pdf is created.
Let us open it with the command open maths-bp.pdf.
We have the file we want. Let me zoom it.
"""Now that we know that the mathematical expression is working, let us move the text inside the block."""
Let us save and export. It is already in the required language. Export.
Let us dismiss this warning.
Let me compile it again.
Let us click the pdf browser that has the file.
"""Now you see the mathematical expression inside the box, the way we want."""
Let us now see what happens if we do not choose the Special flag.
Let me come here.
"""Let me edit the text, change the Special Flag to Normal. Done."""
File > Save. Let me export.
Let me compile. Let me come here.
The formula is no longer in the form we want.
Let us change the “Special Flag” back to “Special”.
"""Save, Export."""
Recompile. You see that the file is in the form we want.
Let us now improve the appearance of this formula.
"""In this case, the use of 'dfrac' will make the fraction look better."""
"""In view of this, let us change 'frac' to 'dfrac'."""
Let me click here. Keep the mouse inside the box.
"""Put 'd' here. Done. Save, Export."""
Let us compile once again using pdflatex.
"""We get the error message “Undefined control sequence” """"\dfrac""""."""
LaTeX complains because the command \dfrac is defined in the package “Amsmath” but we have not included it.
We need to include it in the file maths-bp.tex'.
Let us do it. Let us go to emacs.
Enter “\usepackage{amsmath}”.
Let us save the file. Let us compile once again. Let me first exit.
Let me now recompile. Now it compiles. Let us click this.
We see that the fraction has now come out nicely.
We have now achieved our objective of learning how to embed mathematical expressions in Xfig.
It is important to note that Xfig does not interpret the LaTeX commands at all.
The interpretation is done by the “pdflatex” command.
The LaTeX commands have to be correct and consistent at the time of compilation.
We will now explain how to remove the white space around the figure.
Let me go to the terminal.
"""Let me type the command “pdfcrop maths-bp.pdf” - this is the file we created, into “maths-out.pdf”."""
"""Pdfcrop says, one page written on this file."""
"""“pdfcrop” takes an input file, trims the space around the figure and writes out the cropped file in the output file."""
“pdfcrop” is already installed in my system.
"""If you do not have it, you need to install it first."""
"""Let us view this output file by the command, “open maths-out.pdf”."""
Let me bring it inside.
The figure has now become extremely compact.
The white space that was here has been completely removed.
We can now insert this into documents.
Let me close this. Let me close this also. Let me close this also.
Let me come back to the slides.
The software “briss” can also be used to crop the white space.
"""It is supposed to work on Linux, Mac OS X and also on Windows."""
I have checked its working on Mac OS X. But we will not demonstrate it here.
We have now come to the end of this tutorial.
We have an assignment for you. Make the diagram created in this tutorial more symmetric and beautiful.
Try out different mathematical expressions.
"""Try out other options such as flip and rotate, not covered in the spoken tutorial."""
Try to build different diagrams. Explore the library.
Do an internet search and locate information relevant to Xfig.
Useful learning material is available at spoken-tutorial.org. It is here.
"""The concept of spoken tutorials is explained in """"What is a Spoken Tutorial?""""."""
"""You may learn LaTeX using the spoken tutorials, available here, which I have downloaded in this tab."""
The tutorial on Mathematical Typesetting explains how to create maths in LaTeX.
The tutorial on Tables and Figures explains how to place figures of the type created in this tutorial into documents.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Basics of single dimensional array in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about-  Arrays in awk,"""
"""assigning array elements,"""
how it is different from arrays in other programming languages and refer the elements of an array .
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
You can use any text editor of your choice.
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through previous awk tutorials on our website."""
You should have some basic knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
What is an array in awk? awk supports arrays for storing related elements.
Element can be a number or a string.
Arrays in awk are associative.
This means that each array element is an index-value pair.
It looks very similar to arrays in any other programming language.
But there are some important differences.
"""First, we do not need to declare an array before using it."""
"""Also, there is no need to specify how many elements the array will contain."""
"""In programming languages, array index is generally a positive integer."""
"""Usually the index starts from 0, then 1, then 2 and so on."""
"""But in awk, the index can be anything – any number or a string."""
This is the syntax of assigning an array element in awk. Array name can be any valid variable name.
Here the index can be an integer or a string.
"""Strings have to be written inside double quotes, whether it is index name or a value."""
Let’s understand this with an example.
I have already written the code and saved it as array_intro.awk.
This file is available in the Code Files link below the player. Please download and use it.
"""Here, I have taken weekdays as an example and written it inside the BEGIN section."""
"""Here, the name of the array is day."""
"""I have set the index as 1 and the value as """"Sunday""""."""
"""In this array element, I have used a string as the index. So, for index """"first"""", the value is """"Sunday""""."""
The entire array is constructed likewise.
"""Notice here, the array elements are not in a sequence. I have declared day four before day three."""
"""In awk arrays, index need not to be in a sequential manner."""
Advantage of associative array is that new pairs can be added at any time.
Let me add day 6 in the array.
Place the cursor at the end of the last line and press Enter. Then type the following.
Save the file.
We have declared the array. But how should we refer to the array element?
"""Write the arrayname and the index within square brackets to refer an element, at a particular index. Let us try this."""
Switch to the code once again.
Place the cursor in front of the closing curly brace.
Press Enter and type: print space day within square brackets 6.
Save the code.
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using 'cd' command.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space array_intro.awk . Press Enter."""
"""See, we get Friday as the output."""
Next we will check whether any element exists in an array at a certain index.
"""For this, we have to use the in operator. Let me explain this with an example."""
Switch to the code in the editor window.
Place the cursor at the end of the print statement and press Enter. Then type as shown.
Now I have added two 'if' conditions.
The first if condition checks whether the index two is present in day.
"""If yes, then the corresponding print statement will get executed."""
Then the second condition checks whether the index seven is present in day. It will execute the print statement if it is true.
"""As we can see, index two is in the array and seven is not. Let’s execute this file to verify the output."""
Switch to the terminal. Press the up arrow key to get back the previously executed command.
Press Enter to execute.
We get the output as expected.
We will now make some more changes to the code. Update the code as shown here.
"""Below the 7  in  day condition, I have added one more condition."""
This will check whether the value of index seven is null or not.
"""If true, it will print Index 7 is not null."""
"""We already know that we don’t have any index with 7. So, it will not print anything."""
"""Next, we have changed the print statement of the condition 7 in day."""
Save the code. Let’s see what happens when we execute the code.
Switch to terminal. Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command.
Press Enter to execute.
We got an unexpected output.
"""The statement """"Index 7 is present after null comparison."""" is printed. How is it possible?"""
"""When we write, day[7]  not equal to  null, we are trying to access the element at index 7."""
This access itself will first create an element at index 7 and initialize it with the value null.
"""Next, we are trying to check if any element is actually present at index 7."""
"""As null element is already created, the output shows that Index 7 is present after null comparison."""
"""So, remember this: day at index 7 not equal to  null is a wrong way to check the presence of an element."""
It will create a null element at index 7.
"""Instead, we have to use the in operator."""
It will not create any extra element in the array. This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about- Arrays in awk,"""
"""Assigning array elements,"""
"""How it is different from arrays in other programming languages,"""
Refer the elements of an array .
As an assignment- Define an array flowerColor.
Index will be the names of the flowers.
Value will be the corresponding color of the flowers.
Insert entries for any five flowers of your choice.
Print the color of the fourth flower. Check if the flower “Lotus” is present in the array.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on awk built-in variables and awk script.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about Built-in variables ,  awk script."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and  gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and use them.
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the earlier awk tutorials on this website."""
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on this website."""
"""First, let us see some of the built-in variables in awk."""
"""Capital RS specifies the record separator in an input file. By default, it is newline."""
Capital FS specifies the field separator in an input file.
"""By default, the value of FS is a whitespace."""
"""Capital ORS defines the output record separator. By default, it is newline."""
"""Capital OFS defines the output field separator. By default, it is whitespace."""
Let us understand the meaning of each of these.
Let us have a look at the awkdemo file now.
"""When we are processing this awkdemo file with 'awk' command, this becomes our input file."""
Observe that all the records are separated from each other by a newline character.
"""newline is the default value for record separator RS variable.  So, there is no need to do anything else."""
Notice that all the fields are separated by the pipe symbol. How can we inform awk about it?  Let us see.
"""By default, any number of spaces or  tabs separate the fields."""
We can reset this with the help of hyphen capital F option as learnt in our earlier tutorials.
"""Or else, we can reset this in the BEGIN section with the use of FS variable."""
"""Let us do this through an example. Suppose, I want to find out the name of students who are getting a stipend of more than Rs.5000."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing CTRL, ALT and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using cd command.
Type the command as shown here.
"""Here, in the BEGIN section, we have assigned the value of FS as a pipe symbol. Similarly, we can modify RS variable."""
Press Enter to execute the command.
The output shows the list of students who are receiving more than Rs.5000 as a stipend.
"""Here, the name field and the stipend field are separated by a blank space."""
"""Also, all the records are separated by a newline character."""
Suppose we want colon as the output field separator and double newline as output record separator.
How can we do this? Let us see.
"""In the terminal, press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command."""
Modify the command as shown here and then press Enter.
We get the output in the desired format.
"""Now, suppose our new input file is sample.txt."""
Observe that the field separator here is newline and record separator is double newline.
How can we extract the roll no. and name information from this file?
"""Yes, you have guessed correctly. We have to modify both the FS and RS variables."""
Pause this tutorial and do this as an assignment.
"""Next, let us see other built-in variables."""
Capital NR gives  the Number of Records processed by awk.
Capital NF gives the Number of Fields in the current record.
"""Let us see one example on this. Suppose, we want to find incomplete lines in the file."""
"""Here, incomplete line means it has less than the normal 6 fields."""
Switch to the terminal. Let me clear the terminal using Ctrl and L keys.
Type the command as shown.
"""As the fields are separated by pipe symbol, set the FS value to pipe symbol in the BEGIN section."""
Next we have written NF not equal to 6.
This checks whether the number of fields in the current line is not equal to 6.
"""If true, then  print section will print the record’s line number NR, along with the entire line denoted by $0. Press Enter."""
"""In the output, we can see that record number 16 is the incomplete record. It has only 5 fields instead of 6."""
Let us see one more example. How can we print the first and last field for each student regardless of how many fields there are?
Type the command as shown here on the terminal.
Here we have used hyphen capital F option instead of setting FS variable. Press Enter.
We get only the first and the last fields for each record in the file.
Let’s try something else now.
"""Suppose, the student records are distributed across two files demo1.txt, demo2.txt."""
We want to print the first 3 lines from each of these two files. We can do this using NR variable.
Here are the contents of the two files.
"""Now, to display the first 3 lines from each file, type the following command on the terminal."""
The output shows only the first 3 records of demo1.txt file.
How can we print the same for the second file also?
The solution is to use FNR instead of NR. FNR is the current record number in the current file.
FNR is incremented each time a new record is read.
It is re-initialized to zero each time a new input file is started.
But NR is the number of input records awk has processed since the starting of the program's execution.
It does not reset to zero with a new file.
Switch to the terminal. Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command.
Modify the previous command as follows. Type FNR instead of NR.
"""In the Print section, next to NR, type FNR.  Press Enter."""
"""See, we get the correct output now. FNR is set to zero with new file but NR keeps on increasing."""
Let us now look at some other built-in variables. FILENAME variable gives the name of the file being read.
ARGC specifies the number of arguments provided at the command line.
ARGV represents an array that stores the command line arguments.
ENVIRON specifies the array of the shell environment variables and corresponding values.
"""As ARGV and ENVIRON use array in awk, we will look at those in subsequent tutorials."""
Let us have a look at the variable FILENAME now. How can we print the name of the current file being processed?
Switch to the terminal and type the command as shown.
Here we have used space as a string concatenation operator. Press Enter to execute the command.
The output shows the input filename multiple times.
"""This is because, this command prints the filename once for each row in the awkdemo.txt file. How can we print this only once?"""
Clear the terminal. Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command.
Modify the previous command as shown here. Press Enter.
"""Now, We get the filename only once."""
There are some other built-in variables in awk. Please browse the internet to know more on them.
"""Suppose, we want to  find the students who have passed and have stipend more than Rs.8000"""
use comma as the output field separator  and print “The data is shown for file” and the name of file in the footer section. How can we do this?
"""In the terminal, type the following command. Press Enter."""
"""We can see that only one student has passed and gets stipend more than Rs.8000. And, the record number is 2."""
"""We can also see the name of the file in the footer, as desired."""
We can use awk for more and more complex tasks.
"""In that case, it becomes more difficult to write the commands every time on the terminal."""
We can instead write the awk program in a separate file.
"""To be executable, that file should have the dot awk extension."""
"""While executing, we can just specify this awk program filename with the awk command."""
"""For doing so, we need to use hyphen small f option. Let us see an example."""
I have already written an awk program and saved it as prog1 dot awk.
This code is also available in the Code Files link.
"""Switch to the terminal. See, what have we written inside single quotes of the command last executed?"""
Content of prog1.awk file is exactly the same.
"""The only difference is that in the awk file, we have not written inside the single quotes."""
"""To execute the file, type the following on the terminal- awk space hyphen small f space prog1.awk space awkdemo.txt and press Enter."""
We are getting exactly the same output as we have seen before.
"""So, this way you can write awk programs and use it multiple times."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial we learnt about- Built-in variables, awk script  using various examples."""
As an assignment- write an awk script to print the last field of the 5th line in awkdemo.txt file.
Open the system file /etc/passwd on the terminal.
Identify all the separators therein.
Now write a script to process the file from the 20th line onwards.
"""That too, only for the lines that contain more than 6 fields."""
"""You should print the line number, entire line and count of fields in that particular line."""

Welcome to this tutorial on Tables and Figures.
We have two objectives in this tutorial.
The first one is to explain how to create tables using the tabular environment; the second objective is to explain how to include tables in latex documents using the table environment.
A similar technique can be used to include figures also.
"""We have seen how to create the title page,"""
"""this one has title, author information, and Creative Commons, copyright information as explained in the tutorial on equations."""
Today’s date appears in the last column created by this command.
Let us go to the second page.
"""I will now explain to you, how to create this table in a step-by-step fashion."""
Let us start with a clean slate.
Let me delete these commands.
I will compile this and start with a clean slate.
The tabular environment is created using begin tabular and end tabular commands.
Let me do that here.
"""The ‘r r’ characters within the braces, next to the begin tabular, say that there are two columns and that they are right aligned."""
"""In the first line, the entries are """"mango"""" and """"mixed""""."""
Two reverse-slashes indicate next line.
Let me enter the next line.
"""""""Jackfruit""""."""
"""""""Kolli hills""""."""
"""""""Banana""""."""
"""""""Green""""."""
Let me end this tabular environment.
Let me compile this.
"""And, this has appeared here."""
We get the 3 by 2 table. There are three rows and 2 columns.
The two columns are right aligned as indicated by the 'r r' character.
"""To separate the two columns, we introduce a vertical line between the column alignment characters."""
"""So, let me put that vertical line."""
"""Save it,Compile it."""
You see that a vertical line has come.
"""If you want vertical lines at the end also, put them at appropriate places."""
"""Let me put them, save them, compile them."""
"""So, these have come."""
"""As a matter of fact, we can put more vertical lines."""
Let me put one more vertical line at the beginning.
There you are! A second line has come.
See there are two vertical lines.
We will now try different alignments.
Let's put a ‘c’ here to say that the second column should be center aligned.
This is center aligned now.
Let us make the first column left aligned.
"""Right now, it is right aligned; let me make them left aligned."""
"""'l',Save"""
Compile.
Now it is left aligned.
We will now separate the rows with horizontal lines as follows.
Let's put a h-line here.
Let us see what happens when we do that.
It puts a top line.
"""If I put another h-line here,"""
"""see a line has come,So, let me complete this."""
Let me put h-line.
Here I have to put a break line with two reverse slashes and then h-line.
H-line begins from the beginning of the sentence.
"""So, now I have completed the horizontal lines."""
"""Now, let us add three more columns and one more row."""
"""So, what I do is- I come here, and 'c' , 'c', 'r'."""
"""So, I have added three more columns, first two of them are center aligned the third one is right aligned."""
And then here I want to say:
"""""""fruit"""""""
"""""""type"""""""
"""""""number of units"""""""
"""""""cost per unit"""""""
"""""""cost rupees"""""""
h-line.
"""So, """"mixed"""""""
"""""""20"""""""
"""""""75"""" rupees"""
"""""""1500"""" rupees."""
"""""""Jackfruit"""""""
"""""""10"""" of them"""
"""""""50"""" rupees"""
"""""""500"""" rupees."""
"""""""Banana green"""""""
"""""""10"""" dozens"""
"""""""20"""" rupees a dozen and """"200"""" rupees total."""
"""So, let’s see whether we can compile this."""
"""So, it has created the table."""
"""See the need for right alignment, this is.. so that we can add these numbers."""
"""Suppose, that we want to split the columns in two."""
"""For example, here these two columns have fruit details and these three have cost calculations."""
"""So, this is done with the help of what is known as multi-column command."""
Let me do it as follows.
multi-column
take 2
center-aligned
Fruit Details.
First two are over then I put a tab to indicate the next column.
Go to the next line.
"""multi-column, three, also to be center-aligned."""
Cost within braces – cost calculations
slash h-line.
"""So, there you are."""
"""The first two have the title """"Fruit details"""", the next three have the title """"Cost calculations""""."""
I don’t have the vertical lines that’s because I didn’t tell latex to do that. So let’s do that.
"""Here, I want two vertical lines, here I want one vertical line."""
"""Before this, I already have the line here, so let me just put this here."""
See what happens.
"""So, now the vertical lines have also come."""
Because these 2 and 3 are single character arguments its possible to write them without braces.
"""Okay, same thing works."""
Sometimes it is necessary to draw horizontal lines between only a few columns.
"""So, we explain this as follows."""
"""Let me split this """"mango"""" instead of """"mixed"""", let me call this """"Malgoa"""""""
"""and then """"18"""" kilograms"""
"""""""50"""" kilograms."""
Let me delete this.
"""okay,And here, let me say that it is """"Alfanso"""""""
"""""""2"""" dozens"""
"""""""300"""" rupees a dozen, and a total of 1500."""
Let’s see what happens when I save this. Compile this.
"""So, I’ve got this. What happens is, this line comes here and as well as here and I don’t want this and this. So, this is taken care of by saying instead of this horizontal line, I want a 'c' line and between"
"""So, I should have done this here."""
So let me put this back here.
H-line here.
c-line 2 to 4.
"""Okay, so now I have the line between columns two and four only."""
"""So, this central line has split the mangoes into two of the most popular mangoes in India."""
"""We will conclude this example, conclude this table with a last row."""
Let me total up as follows.
multi-column four
"""2 vertical lines, right-aligned"""
vertical separator
Total cost
Rupees.
Close this.
Next tab
2200
So there you are.
"""So, this was the table that we started with at the beginning of this tutorial."""
How do we work with the tables created using the tabular environment?
Latex treats the entire table created using the tabular environment as a single object.
"""For example- if you write,"""
This is
an
example
"""""""This is an example table""""."""
"""What happens is this table gets sandwiched between these two. """"This is an"""" example to, """"example table""""."""
This table appears in a running sentence.
It is possible to include tables using a centre environment.
A more common approach is to include it in the table environment. As we show now.
begin
table
Close this.
"""So, what happens is now ‘this is an example table’."""
This statement comes separately and whatever that appeared between this ‘begin’ and ‘end’ table have been placed separately as a table.
"""In other words, even though the table appears in between some text, it has been put separately."""
This is not centered.
"""What I can do is, give a command here called ‘centering’"""
to place this at the center of the document.
Let us now create a caption.
Table caption is put before the table.
Let me put a caption here.
"""""""Caption cost of fruits in India""""."""
"""So, the caption has come."""
This is too close; I want to leave a small space.
Let me do that by giving through this v-space command 1 ex.
That is the space equivalent of the ‘x’ character.
"""So, I have left this vertical space."""
"""So, now it looks okay."""
"""By default, Latex places tables at the top of the page."""
This placement is done automatically.
The table is ‘floated’ to the next available slot.
"""To explain this, let me cut and paste some text from the bottom of this document."""
Alright.
"""Now, there is some write up about these fruits."""
Go to the top of this.
Paste it here.
"""So, as before, the table got placed at the top of this page."""
Let me put some more text here.
Four copies.
"""So, now what has happened is-"""
this table has been floated to the second page and
"""there is nothing else here. So, it has been placed at the middle of this page."""
"""Let me put one more copy of this, some more text."""
"""this is the title page, this is the text page, the table has been floated, it has gone to the top of this page."""
"""As in equations, we can also create labels and use them for referencing."""
"""For example,"""
you give this command below the caption command.
You have to give it below the caption command because it is the caption command that creates the table number.
"""For example, here 'table 1' has been created automatically by this caption command."""
"""If you put the label after this, this label will refer to the number created using the caption command."""
So label
fruits.
"""So, let me just go back and say"""
let me add this line here.
"""The cost of these fruits is shown in Table reference, you have to give the label, it should be the same as this."""
tab fruits
Let me compile it.
"""So there it is,On first compilation, this variable is not assigned."""
"""So let me re-compile it, so now I have got this."""
We can create a list of tables automatically
as we explain now.
"""After the make title, suppose we want this list of tables - one word, is the command."""
So what has happened is
it has created a list of tables.
Typically one would have to compile twice to make sure the table number comes correct.
"""Here it comes, the table according to this list is in page two but we know that it is in page 3."""
"""So, this is in page 3."""
"""So, let's go back and compile it once more."""
"""So there you are, it is in page 3."""
So this has been explained before.
"""Alright, this comes to the end of this part in which we explained the tables."""
We will now explain how to create figures using the command called include graphics.
"""So for this, we need to include this package called graphicx."""
"""Okay! Suppose I go to the bottom of this,"""
"""and say, the command is as follows. begin figure"""
include graphics
width equals.
I have a file called iitb.pdf.
There you are.
I include it here with the width of this figure coming out to be equal to that of the line width.
Let me end this figure.
Compile this.
There you are.
"""So, it has also been put at the top of this page."""
"""Alright! What I will do is, let me just, so this is for if I want to use the entire line width ."""
"""Suppose I want to use point 5, that is half a line width,"""
then it has been made small.
And note that it has been left aligned.
"""As in the table, I can say centering"""
which will center this at the middle.
I can also create a caption; figure captions are created after the figure is included.
Golden Jubilee logo of IIT Bombay.
"""Okay, as before I can create a label and refer to it using the ref command."""
I can also make this list of figures appear along with the list of tables.
"""So, suppose I want list of figures also."""
I will compile it.
I will compile it twice.
and there it is. List of figures also comes automatically.
All the figure captions will appear here.
There is one last thing that I want to show you here.
That is how to rotate these figures.
This is done by the angle option.
"""Suppose, angle... I want to rotate by 90 degrees."""
"""So, let's go to this figure."""
Let’s compile this.
"""So, this has been rotated by 90 degrees."""
Rotate it by 'minus 90'.
"""Alright. So, this is the way to include the figures."""
"""Here, I am assuming that iitb.pdf is available."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
The beginners of latex should compile after every few changes to the source document and make sure that what they have entered is correct.
Thank you for listening to this tutorial.
Welcome to Meet the GIMP tutorial on Setting up the Gimp.
"""Today I want to show, how to set up the GIMP when you are using it for the first time."""
"""The GIMP uses a lot of small windows instead of one big window, like all the other Windows & Macintosh programs."""
It’s a history from the Unix world and the Unix people love to have windows scattered all over the screen and to have lot of programs running at the same time.
"""If you are really not able to work with these different windows, then you should look at the GIMPshop."""
It is a program which uses the GIMP and puts a new user interface on it to make it a bit similar to Photoshop.
I would like to use the GIMP because all the new and better tools are in the GIMP.
This is the tip of the day which gives useful information and tips.
"""Right now, there is a tip about the Undo option by which you can do some steps and then change them back with Undo."""
It works most of the time.
It's better to save your work before you do something very different.
"""Now, let's have a look at the other tools."""
"""Here’s the main window from the GIMP, the Command Central."""
"""And at the top here, is the Toolbox."""
Then we have the Color box to select colours from and below are the various options of our tools from Toolbox.
Let’s make this a bit wider.
"""Here we have dialog boxes for Layers, Channels, Color Channels, Path and Undo History."""
"""Below, this is the Colour Selection dialog where you can select various colours."""
"""There are more dialogs like Brushes, Patterns, Gradient and so on."""
I want to include some of these dialogs into the Toolbox. It is very easy to do so.
"""Just click on the word Layers in the title of the dialog and pull it over to the word Color Picker here, below the toolbox."""
And I get a tabbed dialog like this.
I'll do this with Channels.
I'll do this with Paths.
And I'll do this with Undo History.
I don’t think I need the Brushes tool because if a tool has a brush then it appears here and I can select it.
"""But I want to have Colours, so I click on it and drag it next to Undo History."""
And this window here can be closed.
I can access all the dialog boxes through File >> Dialogs.
"""You can see here, there are some dialogs that are not in our Toolbox and we need one of them i.e. Tools."""
My tool box contains some tools which I have never used and I want to replace them with the tools that I want to use.
Let’s start with the tools which I want to have.
"""I want to have Curves, Levels, Threshold. Brightness & Contrast - I don't want to choose."""
I don’t need Perspective Clone nor do I need Ink or Airbrush.
And I need all the remaining tools.
I will have a look at this later after I see how much space is left.
Now I go to File and Preferences.
I leave Environment as it is and Interface also.
"""In Theme, I select Small."""
"""And when I pull this window aside, you see all the icons have shrunk and there’s more space available for information of tools."""
"""Go to Tool Options and change Default interpolation to Sinc , it’s the best interpolation for calculating pixels while resizing or rotating and so on."""
Leave all the other options as they are.
Go to Toolbox and either select if you want to have these options or de-select them.
You can have Colors which is a quick way to change the Foreground and background colours.
"""You can get the Brush and the Gradient tools, here you can have a small image or the thumbnail of the active image."""
"""I don’t need it, so I de-select it. Its up to you if you want to have it or not."""
"""You can leave the Default Image, Default Grid and Default Image Window as they are."""
I am done with all the Preferences.
And
"""I haven’t changed the Path, so I can use this here."""
"""Now, I have to get rid of only one tool here to get some more space. But first I’ll make this a bit wider."""
You can see that the Toolbox dialog is quite cramped.
Just pull it over here.
I think I can add 3 more tools without getting into a new row here.
"""So I will add Brightness, Hue-Saturation and Color Balance."""
All the tools which are not displayed here can be reached by clicking on File and Dialogs.
And now we are set to do our work.
"""When you close the GIMP, all the options are automatically saved and it will start up in the same way in which you had closed it."""
"""And by the way, I am using the development version, the unstable version of GIMP 2.3.18"""
I just saw that 2.3.19 was released today.
It is called 'unstable' but the GIMP is reaching a point where 2.4 is the next stable version on the horizon and this year it is stable as any other software in the market.
That was it for setting up the GIMP.

"""You will learn how to type: accurately, quickly, and efficiently on a computer keyboard that has the English alphabet keys."""
You will also learn to
type without having to look down at the keyboard every time you type.
What is KTouch?
KTouch is a typing tutor. It teaches you how to type using an online interactive keyboard.
You can learn typing at your own pace.
You can gradually increase your typing speed and along with it your accuracy.
"""KTouch also has lectures or typing samples, in various levels of difficulty, for you to practice with."""
"""Here, we are using KTouch 1.7.1 on Ubuntu Linux 11.10."""
You can install KTouch using the Ubuntu Software Centre.

The Correctness indicator displays the percentage correctness of typing.
The New Characters in This Level field displays the characters that you need to practice at the selected level.
The Teacher’s Line displays the characters that have to be typed.
The Student’s Line displays the characters that are typed by you using the keyboard.
The Keyboard is displayed in the centre.
"""The first line of the keyboard displays numerals, special characters and the Backspace key."""
Press the Backspace key to delete typed characters.
"""The second line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, few special characters and the Tab key."""
"""The third line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, colon, semicolon, and Caps lock keys."""
Press the Enter key to go to the next line while typing.
Press the Caps Lock key to type  capital letters.
"""The fourth line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, special characters, and Shift keys."""
Press the Shift key together with any other alphabet key to type capital letters.
Press the Shift key with any other key to type a character given at the top of the key.
"""For example, the key with the numeral 1 has the exclamation mark on top. To type the exclamation mark, press the Shift key together with 1."""
"""The fifth line of the keyboard comprises the Ctrl, Alt and Function keys. It also contains the space bar."""
"""Now let us see if there are differences between the KTouch keyboard, laptop keyboard and desktop keyboard."""
Notice that the KTouch keyboard and the keyboards used in desktops and laptops are similar.
"""Now, let’s see the correct placement of our fingers on the keyboard."""
Look at this slide.It displays the fingers and their names.
"""Fingers, from left to right, are named: Little finger,"""
"""Ring finger, Middle finger,"""
Index finger and Thumb.
"""On your keyboard, place your left hand on the left side of the keyboard."""
Ensure that the little finger is on alphabet ‘A’.
"""Ring finger is on the alphabet ‘S’,"""
"""Middle finger on alphabet ‘D’,"""
Index finger on alphabet ‘F’.
"""Now, place your right hand on the right side of the keyboard."""
Ensure that the little finger is on the colon/semi-colon key.
"""Ring finger on the alphabet ‘L’,"""
"""Middle finger on the alphabet ‘K’,"""
Index finger on the alphabet ‘J’.
Use your right thumb to press the space bar.
"""The first time you open KTouch, the Teacher’s Line displays default text."""
This text lists instructions on how to select the lecture and begin the typing lessons.
"""For the purposes of this tutorial, we shall skip typing the default text and select a lecture."""
"""However, you can pause this tutorial and type the default text."""
"""Now, let us select the lecture to begin the typing lessons."""
"""From the main menu, select File, click Open Lecture."""
The Select Training Lecture File – ‘KTouch’ dialog box appears.
Browse the flowing folder path Root->usr->share->kde4->apps->Ktouch

Notice that the Teacher’s Line now displays a different set of characters.
"""Now, let us start typing."""
"""By default, the Level is set to 1 and the Speed is set to zero."""
The New Characters in This Level displays the characters we will learn in this level.
Notice that the cursor is in the Student’s Line.
Let us type the character displayed in the teacher's line using the keyboard.
"""As we type, the characters are displayed in the 'Student’s Line'."""
Look at the Speed field now.
"""As you type, the number increases or decreases based on the speed of your typing."""
"""If you stop typing, the speed count decreases."""
"""Now, let’s type the numbers seven & eight which are not displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'."""
The 'Student Line' has become red.
Why? That’s because we have mistyped or made an error in typing.
Let’s delete it and complete the typing.
"""When you reach the end of the line, press the Enter key to move to the second line."""
"""Notice, that the 'Teacher’s Line' now displays the next set of characters to type."""
The 'Student’s line' is cleared of the typed text.
Let’s check how accurately we have typed.
"""The Correctness field displays the percentage of correctness of your typing. For example, it may display 80 percent."""
We have completed our first typing lesson!
It is a good practice to first learn to type accurately at lower speeds.
"""Once we learn to type accurately, without mistakes, we can increase the typing speed."""
Let’s begin a new typing session.
Click Start New Session.
"""In the Start new training session – ‘KTouch’ dialog box, click Start from First Level."""
What do you see?
A set of characters are displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
The 'Student’s Line' is cleared of all characters and is blank.
Let’s start typing.
"""While practicing, you may want to pause and restart later."""
How do you pause your session?
Click Pause Session.
Notice that the speed does not decrease.
Recall that it decreased when we stopped typing without pausing the earlier session.
"""To resume typing, type the next character   displayed in the 'Teacher’s line'."""
"""Once we complete typing, we can check the Correctness field. It displays the accuracy of typing."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on KTouch.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about the KTouch interface. We also learnt how to: place our fingers on the key board,"""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Subclassing and Method overriding.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:  subclassing , extends keyword and  method overriding."""
"""Here we are using:  Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 , JDK 1.7 , Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit our website."""
"""First of all, we will learn what subclassing is."""
It is a way to create a new class from an existing class.
The new class created is  subclass or derived class or child class.
The already existing class is called superclass or base class or parent class.
"""Now, let me show you how to create a subclass. I have already created a project named MyProject."""
I have created a class  in it named Employee.
"""It has variables, name and email_address."""
It also has the setter and getter methods for the class.
"""It has a method """"getDetails()"""". This method returns  """"name"""" and """"email_address""""."""
"""Now, let us come to the Manager class."""
"""It has variables- name, email_address and department."""
We can see that some variables are common to both Employee and Manager class.
name and email_address are present in the Employee class. We can see that it is also there in Manager class.
"""Thus, Manager class can be made a subclass of Employee class."""
"""For that, we have to make some changes in the Manager class."""
"""After public class Manager, type: extends Employee."""
We use the extends keyword to create a subclass from an existing class.
Remove the duplicate variables common to both the classes.
"""So, remove name and email_address from Manager class."""
Also remove setter and getter methods of the same.
"""In the class 'Manager', we will have only one variable department."""
We also have the setter and getter method for department.
"""In this way, the 'Manager' class inherits the members of 'Employee' class."""
This way of extending one class from another is called single inheritance.
I have also created another class named 'TestEmployee'.
"""Inside the main method, we will create the object of  Manager class."""
"""So, inside the main method, type: Manager manager equal to new Manager parentheses."""
"""Next, we will call the setter methods of the Manager class."""
"""So, type, manager dot setName within brackets and double quotes Nikkita Dinesh"""
Then type: manager dot setEmail within brackets and double quotes abc at gmail dot com.
"""Then type, manager dot setDepartment within brackets and double quotes Accounts."""
"""You can use any name, email address and department."""
"""Now, let us call the getDetails() method using the Manager object."""
"""So, type: System.out.println within brackets manager dot getDetails."""
"""Now, let us save and run the program."""
"""We can see that we get the output as: Name: Nikkita Dinesh ,Email: abc@gmail.com"""
"""Here, the object of the 'Manager' class calls the getDetails() method."""
"""Now, come to the Manager class."""
We can see that there is no getDetails() method here.
"""But, we still got the output. This is because, the Manager class extends the Employee class."""
The Manager class automatically inherits the variables and methods of  Employee class.
"""So, it checks in the parent class which is Employee."""
Let us come to the Employee class. It finds the getDetails() method here.
"""Note that we have not returned the department. As a result, it did not print the department in the output."""
"""Now, let us change the getDetails method  to private. Save the file."""
We can see that we get a compilation error in the TestEmployee class.
"""It says """"The method getDetails() from the type Employee is not visible""""."""
This means that getDetails() method cannot be accessed.
This is because we have declared getDetails() method as 'private'.
A subclass does not inherit the private members of its superclass.
Subclass cannot directly access the private members of the superclass.
The superclass can have public or protected methods.
These methods can access their private fields.
The subclass can also access the private fields through these methods.
"""So, let us change it back to public."""
"""Now, let us include the method getDetails in the Manager class."""
"""This method will return name, email_address and department."""
"""So, type: public String getDetails parentheses."""
"""Inside the method, type: return within brackets Name plus getName() plus slash n plus Email plus getEmail() plus slash n plus Manager of plus getDepartment() semicolon.  Save the file."""
"""Note that now, we have the method getDetails in both 'Manager' and 'Employee' class."""
"""The name, return type and argument list of the method is same in both the classes."""
"""A method in the subclass is said to override the method in the parent class if: name ,return type ,argument list ,match exactly."""
Come back to the Manager class.
"""Before the getDetails() method, type: @Override."""
This is an override annotation. It indicates that a method is intended to override a method in superclass.
"""Now, let us see what annotation is."""
"""Annotations:  start with at (@) sign character , provide data about a program , have no direct effect on the operation of the code."""
"""If a method is annotated with @Override, compiler generates error if:  the method does override a method declared in a superclass."""
The method signature is different in its superclass.
"""Now, let us come back to the IDE. Come back to the Manager class."""
The at (@) sign character indicates the compiler that what follows is an annotation.
"""Here, it shows that the getDetails() method is overridden."""
Let us come to the TestEmployee class.
Save the file and run the program.
"""We get the output as follows: Name: Nikkita Dinesh ,Email: abc@gmail.com ,Manager of Accounts ."""
"""Here, the object of the Manager class calls the getDetails() method."""
"""But this time, it calls the method of Manager class itself."""
"""In this way, we override the method of the parent class by the subclass."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt about:Subclassing and Method Overriding."""
"""As an assignment, create a class Vehicle which has a method run that prints “The Vehicle is running.”"""
Also create a class Bike which has a method run that prints “The Bike is running safely.”
The output should be “The Bike is running safely.”

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on the Mozilla Firefox - Search and Auto-complete features.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Search, manage Search Engines, use the Find bar,"""
use Auto-complete in the Address bar.
"""In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04."""
One of the most common things people do on the internet is to search for information.
One can search for a specific website or for some other information.
Mozilla Firefox has a number of functionalities that make it easy to search for information on the Internet.
Let’s look at some of the ways.
One way is to search by visiting other websites.
"""After all, search engines are websites too!"""
"""In the URL bar, type: ‘www.google.com’."""
The google home page comes up.
"""In the search box  of the google home page, type: ‘email’ and click Search."""
The search engine brings up all the results.
"""We see that the top result is for g mail, the email from 'google'."""
"""But, there is an easier way to do the same thing with Mozilla Firefox."""
"""Next to the 'URL bar' on the navigation toolbar, there is a Search bar field."""
"""Alternately, you can press Ctrl+K to directly go to the Search bar  field."""
Click on the search bar and type ‘email’.
Click the magnifying glass icon that is next to it.
We will see the results of the search in the contents area.
"""We see that the top result is for 'gmail', the email from 'google'."""
"""On the left side of the 'Search bar', the logo of the search engine which has been used to bring up the results is seen."""
The default search engine used in Mozilla Firefox is ‘google’.
"""But, we need not be constrained by this. We can choose the search engine of our choice."""
Click on the google’s search engine logo within the Search bar.
We notice that a drop-down box appears with the logos of most popular search engines including “Yahoo” and “Bing”.
Select “Yahoo” from the drop-down box.
We observe that the logo on the left of the search bar has now changed to the “Yahoo” logo.
"""Now, let's  type ‘email’ again in the 'Search bar' and click the magnifying glass."""
This time we see that the results in the Contents area are from the “Yahoo” search engine.
Observe that the results are slightly different from last time.
"""The top result is no longer 'gmail'. Instead, the top result is “Yahoo” mail."""
Click on the search engine logo within the 'Search bar' again.
"""In the drop-down box,  select Manage Search Engines."""
This opens a dialog box entitled ‘Manage Search Engine List'.
Click on the last item in the list.
The buttons on the right side are now enabled. Click on the Remove button.
We see that the item we chose is no longer on the list.
Click on OK to close the dialog box.
Click on the search engine logo within the 'Search bar' again.
Click on “Manage Search Engines”.
"""The “Manage Search Engines List"""" dialog box pops up."""
At the bottom of the dialog is a link that says ‘Get more search engines…’.
Click on it.A new browser tab opens.
It displays a number of search engines that we can add to the search bar.
You can add any of the 'search engines' according to your requirement.
Let's close this tab by clicking on the 'x' at the corner of the tab.
We can find specific text which is within the Contents area with the help of the Find bar.
"""In the URL bar, type: ‘www.gmail.com’ and press Enter."""
"""When the 'gmail home page' has loaded, click on Edit and then on Find."""
A Find bar appears at the bottom of the browser window.
"""In the text box of the “Find bar”, type: ‘gmail’."""
"""As we type, we see that the first instance of that text is being highlighted in the Contents area."""
Clicking on Next will move the focus to the next instance of the word.
Clicking on Previous will move the focus to the previous instance of the word.
Click on Highlight all option.
We see that all instances of the search text are highlighted in the Contents area.
Mozilla Firefox makes it easy to type web addresses in the 'URL bar' with its auto-complete function.
We don’t have to type the entire web address in the address bar.
"""Try this: In the 'address bar', type: ‘gma’."""
We see that Mozilla Firefox tries to auto-complete the word we are typing.
It brings up a drop-down list with websites that start with ‘gma’.
Choose the ‘gmail’ link from the drop-down list.
The ‘gmail’ webpage loads in the 'Contents area'.
"""If we do not like this feature, we can turn it off."""
Click on Edit and then on Preferences.
Windows users can click on Tools and then on Options.
Choose the Privacy tab from the list of main-menu tabs.
"""At the very bottom of the dialog box, is an option named ‘When using the location bar, suggest’."""
Click on the arrow of  the drop-down list to expand it.
Select 'Nothing' from the list.
Click on ‘Close’ to close the dialog box.
Let's go back to the 'address bar' and type ‘gma’. Notice that no suggestions come up.
This concludes this tutorial of Mozilla Firefox - Searching and Auto-complete features.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt how to: use Search, manage Search Engine, use the Find bar, use Auto-compete in Address bar."""
Try this comprehension test assignment.
Change the search engine in the search bar to “Yahoo”.
Search for ‘spoken tutorial’.
Click on the first result.
Find how many times the word “video” appears in the page.
"""Now, click on ‘Highlight all’ to highlight all the instances of the word “video” in the webpage."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Scope of variables in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial we will learn,"""
What is the Scope of variable?
What is a Global variable?
What is a Local variable?
Few  examples.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using"""
"""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."""
Let us start with the introduction to the scope of variables.
It is the region of code within which the variable can be accessed.
Depending on it's type and place of declaration it is divided into two categories:
Global Variable &
Local Variable.
Now we will see an example.
I have already typed the program on the editor.
Let me open it.
Note that our file name is scope.c.
Here we have declared two global variables a and b.
And we have initialized them by assigning values as 5 and 2.
A global variable is available to all functions in your program.
"""These are declared outside any functions, above main() function."""
These have a global scope.
Here we have declared a function add without arguments.
"""Here 'sum' is  a local variable, it is declared inside the function add."""
A local variable is available only to the function inside which it is declared.
These variables are declared inside a block.
These have local scope.
Then sum of a & b will be stored in the variable 'sum'. Here we print the sum.
The add function is called and then executed.
And this is our return statement.
Let us execute the program.
"""Please open the terminal window  by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space scope.c space hyphen o space sco and press Enter."""
"""To execute, type ./sco (dot slash sco), press Enter."""
The output is displayed as
Sum of a and b is 7.
Now let us see how to execute the same program in C++.
"""Come back to our program. First press Shift, Ctrl & S keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Now save the file with an extension .cpp  (dot cpp) and click on Save.
Let us change the header file as iostream.
Now  include the using statement. Click on save .
The  declaration of global variable and local variable is same in  C++.
"""So, no need to change anything."""
Now replace the printf statement with the cout statement.
Delete the format specifier and ''.
Now delete the comma.
Type two opening angle brackets.
"""Delete the closing bracket, again type two opening angle brackets."""
And within the double quotes type backslash n. Now click on Save.
"""To compile, type g++ space scope dot cpp space -o space sco1"""
Here we have sco1 because we don't want to overwrite output parameter sco for the file 'scope.c'.
To execute type ./sco1 and press Enter.
The output is displayed as  Sum of a and b is 7.
We can see  that it is similar to our C code.
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across.
Come back to our program. Suppose here I will declare a  variable a again.
Type int a  and a semicolon.
Click on Save. We have declared  the variable 'a' above the main() function and after the add function.
Let us see what happens.
Come back to our  terminal.
Now compile as before.
"""We see errors, redefinition of 'int a'  ,  'int a' previously defined here. Come back to our program."""
a is a global variable.
It has a global scope.
We cannot declare the variable twice as it is already declared globally.
We can only declare variable a as a local variable .
Let us fix the error.
Delete this .
Let us execute again Come back to our terminal.
"""Now compile as before, execute as before."""
"""In this tutorial we learnt ,"""
"""Scope of variable,"""
"""Global variable, e.g : int a=5 &"""
"""and  local variable ,e.g:int sum"""
write a program to print the difference of two numbers.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Static blocks .
In this tutorial we will learn:  What are static blocks
How to declare static blocks and  How to use static blocks.
Here we are using :Ubuntu 14.04 JDK 1 .7 and  Eclipse 4.3.1
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
"""You should also have the knowledge of instance variables, static variables and static methods in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
Let us learn about static blocks.
A  Static block is mostly used for initializing values of static variables.
A static block is declared using the static keyword.
Static blocks are executed when the class is loaded in memory.
"""If there are static blocks in a program, they are invoked before constructors."""
We cannot access instance variables inside a static block.
"""Now, we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called StaticBlockDemo."""
"""Inside this project, we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Static Blocks."""
Right click on src folder and click New-> Class.
Type the name of the class as StudentEnroll and press Enter.
Now type the following code to represent the StudentEnroll class.
Note that there are two static variables count and orgname.
Now click on Source -> and select Generate Constructor using Fields.
Delete the super keyword from the generated code.
We want a message to be printed whenever the constructor is invoked.
"""So inside this constructor, type the following code to print “Constructor invoked”."""
Now we will add a method showData( ) to this class to print the values of the variables.
So type the following code.
Now we will add a static block to initialize the values of count and orgname.
The variables orgname and count are static variables.
This block of code within the curly brackets prefixed by the static keyword is a static block.
This static block initializes the values for count and orgname as 100 and IITM respectively.
"""Inside this static block, type the following code to print “static block-1 is invoked”."""
Now we will add one more class containing the main method.
"""So right click on the default package, click New-> Class and then type the name as Demo."""
Inside this class we will have the main method.
Type main and then press Ctrl+space to generate the main method.
We will create an object of StudentEnroll class.
Type the following code to create an object s1.
Now let us invoke the showData method to print the values.
Type s1.showData() semicolon
Now let us run the Demo program.
We can observe that static block is invoked before the constructor.
The values of count and orgname are initialized as defined in the static block.
Now let us go back to the StudentEnroll class.
Let us see what happens if we initialise the value of id inside the static block.
"""Inside the static block type,  id equals IT01 semicolon"""
We can see that an error comes up.
It indicates that an instance variable cannot be accessed inside a static block
Now let us comment this line and proceed further.
Let us go back to the slides
A class can contain multiple static blocks.
In such a case they are called only once in the order that they appear in the source code.
Switch back to Eclipse to verify it.
Let us include one more static block after the existing one.
This static block initializes the values for count and orgname as 200 and IITB respectively.
Inside this static block type the following code.
Now let us run the Demo program again.
"""From the output, We can verify that the second static block is invoked after the first."""
The values of the static variables count and orgname are updated by the second static block.
They are 200 and IITB respectively.
In this tutorial we have learnt : What is a static block How to declare and define a static block and  How static blocks are invoked and executed.
"""For the Assignment, This assignment is a continuation of the Static Methods assignment."""
Make sure that you have completed the Static Methods assignment.
As before design the class CarService as specified in this slide.
Identify the instance variables and static variables.
Define a constructor to initialize the values for instance variables.
Define a static block to initialize the values of static variables.
Also create a Demo class containing the main method.
"""Inside the main method, create a few objects of CarService and invoke the show( ) method."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Creating objects.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Reference Variables Constructing objects and Memory Allocation for objects."""
"""Here, we are using : Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse IDE 3.7.0"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know how to create a simple class using Eclipse."""
"""If not, please see the Spoken Tutorial on these topics available at Spoken hyphen Tutorial dot org."""
We know that variables and methods together form the members of a class.
"""To access the members of a class, we need to create an object for the class."""
"""Now, let us see what an object is."""
An object is an instance of a class.
Each object consist of state and behavior.
"""Recall the example of 'human being' class, we had discussed in the earlier tutorial."""
Object stores its state in fields or variables.
It exposes its behavior through methods.
Now let us learn about reference variables.
We know about the 8 primitive data types in Java.
All other types refer to objects rather than primitives.
Variables that refer to objects are reference variables.
Let us go back to the Student class which we have already created in the earlier tutorial.
"""Now, let me remove the main method from this class."""
"""Now, Save the file by pressing Control and S keys simultaneously."""
"""Now, create another class named TestStudent inside the same project."""
I have already created it.
"""In this class, I have the main method."""
"""Now, inside the main method I will create an object of the Student class."""
"""For that, inside the main method, type:"""
Student space stud1 equal to new space Student opening and closing brackets semicolon.
"""Thus, we have created an object of the Student class."""
"""Here, Student is the name of the class for which the object is to be created."""
stud1 is a reference variable referring to one object of the Student class.
And the new keyword allocates space for the new object to be created.
Please note that stud1 is not the object of the Student class.
It only holds the reference of the new object created.
"""Now, let us see what stud1 contains."""
"""So, next line, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes stud1 contains space plus stud1 and then semicolon."""
"""Now, save and run the file TestStudent dot java."""
We get the output as follows.
"""So, here Student is the name of the class of the new object created."""
The second part is the memory address of the new object created.
We can access the fields and methods of the Student class using stud1.
We will learn about these in the coming tutorials.
"""Now, I will create one more object of the Student class."""
"""So, I will type: Student space stud2 equal to new space Student opening and closing brackets semicolon."""
"""Now, type: next line System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes stud2 contains space plus stud2 and then semicolon."""
"""Now, let us save and run this file."""
"""We can see that, here, stud1 and stud2 refer to two different objects."""
"""That is, stud1 and stud2 are referring to two different students."""
They have different roll numbers and names.
"""Now, we can make a change here."""
"""Here, type: Student stud2 equal to stud1."""
"""Now, save and run this file."""
"""We can see that, here, both stud1 and stud2 refer to the same object."""
"""That means, both stud1 and stud2 are referring to the same student with a roll number and name."""
"""So, in this tutorial, we learnt about:"""
"""Reference variables,  Creating object using new operator"""
And  assigning references.
"""For self assessment,"""
Create another class named TestEmployee.
Create an object of the Employee class  with reference variable as emp1.

Thanks for joining us.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on More on sed.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn some more on 'sed' commands through some examples."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:"""
Linux  Operating System and
GNU BASH version 4.2.24
"""Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
"""As prerequisites,"""
you should know basics of Linux terminal.
You should be aware of sed tool.
"""For relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown: http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
The major use of sed is substitution.
Replacing some pattern in the input with something else.
Let's first look at the original file seddemo.txt.
Notice that the word Kumar occurs two times in the fourth line and once in the sixth line.
"""If you want to replace all occurrences of ‘Kumar’ with ‘Roy’,"""
type on the terminal:
sed space within single quote 's front slash / opening square bracket small k capital K   closing square bracket umar  slash Roy slash' after the single quotes space seddemo.txt.
Notice the fourth line.
"""Only the first occurrence of Kumar is changed to Roy, not the second one."""
Sixth line had one occurrence of the word Kumar and this is replaced now.
"""So, we see only the first entry of the lines has been changed."""
"""This is because, by default, the first matched entry of any line is substituted."""
"""To substitute all the matched entries, we need to use the flag  g option."""
Let me clear the prompt.
Type:  sed space within single quotes 's front slash opening square bracket small k capital K closing square bracket umar slash Roy slash g' after the single quote space seddemo.txt press Enter.
"""Now, both entries of the fourth line are replaced."""
We can make multiple substitutions in one go as well.
"""Say, we want to replace the word  """"electronics"""" with the word """"electrical"""""""
"""and """"civil"""" with """"metallurgy"""" in the file seddemo.txt."""
Let me clear the prompt.
Type:  sed space hyphen e space within single quotes s front slash electronics slash electrical slash g  after the single quote space hyphen e space within single quotes  s front slash civil slash metallurgy
press Enter.
You can see that the words are replaced.
"""Now we want to change the stream of """"Anirban"""" from """"computers"""" to """"mathematics""""."""
"""In such case, we would need to type:"""
sed space within single quotes 'front slash Anirban slash s slash computers slash mathematics slash g'  after the single quotes space seddemo.txt
We see that the stream is changed.
Let us understand what this is.
"""First we write sed, then in single quotes we write the pattern to be matched."""
"""This is """"Anirban""""."""
Now after the slash comes the operation.
This is s that stands for substitution as we have already seen.
"""Then we mention the pattern to be replaced which is """"computers""""."""
"""Then the new word that would be substituted which is """"mathematics""""."""
We can also use sed to add or delete lines in the file.
"""Say, we want to select those lines which do not have stream as """"electronics""""."""
"""For that, we have the d flag."""
Type:  sed space within single quotes front slash electronics slash d after the single quotes space seddemo.txt space greater than sign space nonelectronics.txt
"""To see the contents, type: cat space nonelectronics.txt."""
"""Say, at the start of the file we want to add a line Student Information."""
For that we have the i action.
We need to type: sed space in single quotes '1i space Student Information' after the quote seddemo.txt
You can see the output.
"""In fact, we can enter multiple lines like this."""
"""Say, we want to add the two lines we would do it in a similar way."""
Along with Student Information we also want to add academics in the next year.
"""So, in that case, we would write  sed space in single quotes 1i space Student Information backslash n 2013' after the quotes seddemo.txt."""
press Enter.
Notice backslash n between the string ‘Information’ and ‘2013’.
backslash n prints 2013 in the next line after ‘Student Information’.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt:"""
Substitution Replacement and Insertion.
"As an assignment, use the same text file seddemo.txt and try to replace or substitute name Ankit with Ashish."

This tutorial is recorded using:  Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04
"""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30"""
Moodle 3.3  and   Firefox web browser
"""You may use any web browser of your choice. However, Internet Explorer should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
This tutorial assumes that your site administrator has set up a Moodle website  and registered you as a teacher.
Learners of this tutorial should have  a teacher login on Moodle
At least one course assigned to them by the administrator some course material uploaded for their respective course
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and open your moodle site.
Login with your teacher username and password details. I am already logged in as teacher Rebecca Raymond.
We are in the teacher’s dashboard.
"""In the navigation menu on the left, notice Calculus under My Courses."""
Please note. All the courses for which you are enrolled as a teacher or student will be listed here.

So that’s how we can upload Course summary files.
Next comes Course format.  Course format refers to the way resources and activities are organized for the students.
"""There are 4 options in Format dropdown - Single Activity Format, Social Format ,  Topics Format and  Weekly Format."""
Our admin has selected Topics format. We will let it remain as it is.
Next setting is for Hidden sections. These are basically topics in a course that can be kept hidden from students.
"""This can be useful when there is a certain topic, which is not yet completed by the teacher. This setting determines how to present the Hidden sections to students."""
Choosing this option will display the content in collapsed form to the students.
Choosing this option will hide the content from the students.
"""We will let it remain as default, for now."""
The next drop-down is Course Layout. Click on it.
"""We can choose to show all sections in one page, by selecting this option."""
"""Another option here is Show one section per page. This will split the course over several pages, depending on the number of sections."""
"""We will let it remain on Show all sections in one page, for now."""
Next is the Appearance section.
Notice the Show gradebook to students option. Many activities in the course allow teachers to assign grades.
"""This option determines whether a student can see those grades. This option is set to Yes, by default. We will let it remain as is."""
"""We will change Show activity reports as Yes, if not already selected by default."""
This ensures that a student can see his/her activity reports from his/her profile page.
We can set the maximum size of the files that can be uploaded for this course.
"""Files can be uploaded for additional materials, assignments, etc."""
"""Our admin has set this to 128MB, which is the maximum file size. Let us keep the size as it is."""
We will let all the other settings remain at their default values.

"""This will let the students know about mandatory information, latest news, announcements, etc."""
Click on the gear icon at the top right of the page and then on Turn Editing On.
"""NOTE: You need to turn the editing on, to make any changes to the course."""
"""Now, to the right of Announcements, click on Edit and then Edit Settings."""
And in Description I will type the following text. “Please check the announcements regularly”.
Check Display description on course page. This will display the description just below the link.
Leave all other settings as they are.
Scroll down and click on the button Save and return to course. We come back to the Course page.
"""To add more announcements, click on the Announcements title."""
Now click on Add a new topic button. Type the Subject as Minimum requirements.
Type the message as  “This course requires you to submit a minimum of 3 assignments and attempt 5 quizzes to pass”.
Notice that the checkbox Discussion subscription is checked and is non-editable. This is because everyone enrolled in the course is compulsorily subscribed to it.
Next is Attachments. You can either drag and drop or upload related files here.
"""If you want the announcements to show up at the top of the forum, click on Pinned checkbox. I will tick it."""
"""Tick the next checkbox, as well. This will send a notification to everyone subscribed to this forum immediately."""
Expand the next section Display period. The settings here determine if this forum post should be visible for a date range.
"""By default, these are disabled. It means the posts will always be visible. We will let the default settings remain."""
Scroll down and click Post to forum button.
A success message is displayed. Post authors have 30 min to make any changes to the posts.
Let me click on Calculus link in the breadcrumb.
Let me now add a page with detailed syllabus to this section.
"""Click on Add an activity or resource link at the bottom right of the General section. From the list of Resources, choose Page."""
Read the description of this activity that will appear when you make the choice.
Then click on the Add button at the bottom. We are brought to a new page.

Let me show you how this page will look like to a student.
I have a student ID Priya Sinha with me. This student has also been enrolled in the Calculus course by the admin.
I have logged in as student Priya Sinha. Now I will click on Calculus on the left.
This is how a student will view this page. Notice that there is no gear icon at the top right of this page.
This is because students cannot edit any part of the course.
We will now log out of the student id.

You can attach up to 25 megabytes (MB) in size.
"""To send files that are larger than this, you can use Insert files using Drive option."""
Let us first attach a 'pdf file' which is less than 1Mb in size.
Click on the Attach file icon which looks like a paper clip.
This will open the file browser.
Browse and select the file you want to send via mail.
"""From the Desktop, I will select """"myscript.pdf"""" and click on Open."""
We can see that our file is getting attached to our mail.
Multiple files can also be attached to the same mail by using Attach files option.
"""To remove a file you've attached to a message, click on the 'x' mark to the right of the filename."""
"""Now, let us attach a file which is around 30Mb."""
I have a zip file on my Desktop which is around 30Mb file size.
Click the Attach files icon once again.
Browse and select the 30Mb zip file and click on Open.
We will get the popup message:
"""""""The file you are trying to send exceeds the 25mb attachment limit""""."""
And it gives us the option to Send using Google drive.
Click on Send using google drive button.

We are now ready to send our mail.
Click on Send button.
We get the following message on the screen-
This Drive file isn't shared with all recipients.
"""This is because we did not share the file with the people who are marked on this email."""""""
Click on Share & Send button.
"""On the screen, we will see either of the two messages:"""
"""Your message is """"sending"""""""
"""or """"Your message has been sent""""."""
"""To view the sent mail, click on View Message link."""
We can see the contents of the email which we sent here.
Let us cross-check one-by-one.
Here are the attachments
and here is the URL link.
"""Below the mail address, there is an inverted triangle that shows the header details."""
Let me click on it.
"""We can see the email-ids of all the recipients in To, Cc and Bcc fields."""
Let us see how the email will appear to the recipients.
This is the mail-id of the recipient marked in Cc.
You can see the message which is sent now. Let me open this to read.
Click on Show Details.
It displays To and Cc but not the Bcc recipients.
This is the mail-id of one of the recipient marked in Bcc.
You can see the message which is sent now.
Let me open this to read.
"""You can see To, Cc and Bcc recipient details."""
Let me come back to the sender’s gmail account.
"""Look over here, we mentioned 2 recipients in the Bcc."""
But here we can see only one email id. The other one is not visible.
This is how the Bcc feature works.
Hope you are able to understand the differences clearly.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about:"""
"""The email recipients namely, To, Cc, Bcc"""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on How to catalog Serial subscriptions.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to catalog Serial subscriptions."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux Operating System 16.04 and  Koha version 16.05"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have: Koha installed on your system. And, you should also have Admin access in Koha."""
"""If not, please refer to the Koha Spoken Tutorial series on this website."""
"""Before we begin, let us understand- What are Serials module?"""
"""Serials module is used for managing subscription of- Journals,"""
Magazines and Periodicals   that are published periodically.
"""In this demo, I am going to catalog a serial publication - with the title- Indian Journal of Microbiology,"""
"""Volume-57, Number- 1,  Quarterly publication for the month of- Jan to March 2017"""
"""To do so, login with the Superlibrarian username and password."""
"""On the Homepage, click on Cataloging."""
"""Then click on +New record. From the drop-down, select Serials."""
A new page Add MARC record opens.
Let us proceed to fill in the details below.
Notice that there are a few mandatory fields on this page.
"""Interestingly, Koha auto-generates values for a few mandatory fields."""
"""Among the range of tabs from 0 to 9, we will start with tab zero."""
"""Click inside the field for 000,  LEADER. By default, Koha shows this value."""
"""Next, click inside the field for 005 DATE AND TIME OF LATEST TRANSACTION."""
Koha auto generates this value  for my machine.
You will see a different value on your interface.
I will skip the fields for 006 and 007.
"""When 008 FIXED-LENGTH DATA ELEMENTS--GENERAL INFORMATION is clicked, Koha auto generates this value"""
"""Next, go to the tab 022 ISSN."""
Locate the two blank boxes adjacent to 022 question mark.
Note that when you click on the ? (question mark) then the entire MARC 21 Bibliographic format for the respective tag 022 opens up.
"""Here, both the indicators are undefined."""
"""Now, let us go back to the Koha interface."""
"""So, I will skip the two blank boxes."""
"""Next, locate the sub-field ‘a’ International Standard Serial Number."""
Enter an 8 digit Journal ISSN.
"""However, you have to add the ISSN of the Journal that you have chosen to catalog."""
I will skip the rest of the fields.
You may consider filling these fields as per the requirement of your library.
"""Next, go to the tab 040 CATALOGING SOURCE. Locate the two blank boxes adjacent to 040 ?."""
"""Here, both the indicators are undefined."""

Let us again go back to the Koha interface.
"""Now, type 0 in the first blank box. Note that  0 is the indicator for No added Entry."""
Type 0 in the 2nd blank box also.
2nd indicator represents a non-filling character.
I have entered 0 because under this TITLE: there is no non-filling character.
"""In the sub-field ‘a’, Title , type: Indian Journal of Microbiology."""
You can type the title of your Journal here.

Locate the two blank boxes adjacent to 310?.
"""Both the indicators for this are undefined. So, I will leave the two blank boxes as they are."""
Click on CURRENT PUBLICATION FREQUENCY to expand the tag so that we can fill in the sub-fields.
"""In the sub-field ‘a’ Current publication frequency, I will type Quarterly."""
This is because my journal is a quarterly Serial.
"""If yours is different, for eg: monthly, bi-monthly etc. then fill accordingly."""
"""Next, go back to the top again and from the tabs 0 to 9, click on the tab 6."""
Locate the field 650 SUBJECT ADDED ENTRY--TOPICAL TERM.
Locate the two blank boxes adjacent to 650 ?. Type 1 in the first blank box.
Note that 1 is the indicator for Primary (Level of subject).
Type 0 in the second blank box.
Note that  0 is the indicator for Library of Congress Subject Headings (Thesaurus).
Next comes the sub-field ‘a’ Topical term or geographic name as entry element.
"""Here, I will type subject heading as Microbiology."""
You have to type a relevant subject heading for your Book or Serial.
"""In case more than one keyword has to be added, then as explained in an earlier tutorial, click on the small button: Repeat this Tag."""
Duplicate of the tab 650 appears.
"""Go back to the top again and from the tabs 0 to 9, click on the tab 7."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Tokens in C and C Plus Plus.
"""In this tutorial we will learn , how to define and use tokens."
We will do this with the help of an example.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10,"" gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with an introduction.
"""Token is a generic word for data types, variables, constants and identifiers."""
Let us start with our program.
I have already typed the code on the editor.
Let me open it.
Note that our file name is 'tokens.c'.
In this program we will initialize the variables and print their values.
Let me explain the code now.
This is our main function.
"""Here, int is a keyword."""
The compiler knows the meaning of keyword.
a is an integer variable.
We have assigned a value of 2 to it.
This is called as initialization.
If a value is not assigned to a variable then it is called as declaration of the variable.
"""Here, b is a constant."""
We have initialized 'b' by assigning a value of 4 to it.
const keyword is used to create 'read only' variable.
Let us switch back to our slides to know more about keywords and constant.
Keywords have fixed meanings that cannot be changed.
Keywords cannot be used as variable names.
There are 32 keywords in C.
"""To name some, auto, break, case, char, enum, extern, etc."""
Constants: constants are fixed values.
They do not change during the execution of a program.
"""There are two types of constants, Numeric constants and Character constants."""
Now come back to our program.
"""Here, float is a data type of variable c."""
We have assigned it a value of 1.5.
Data type is a finite set of values along with a set of rules.
"""Here, d is a variable."""
char and single quotes suggest that we are dealing with a character.
"""As a result, d is a character variable  storing the value A."""
"""It is easy to see that int, double, float and char are data types."""
"""a, c and d are variables."""
Now come back to our slides.
We will know more about data types and variables.
Data types: Let us begin with integer data type.
It is declared as int.
"""If we want to print an integer data type , we will use %d as the format specifier."""
"""Similarly, we will use float and %f for floating point numbers."""
"""For character data type, we will  use char and %c."""
"""And For double data type, we will use double and %lf as the format specifier."""
Now we will see the range of data types.
Integer data type has a range of this
Floating point has a range of this
Character has a range of this
And Double has a range of this
The values stored in the variable must not be greater or less than this range.
Now we will move on to variables.
Variable is a data name.
It may be used to store a data value .
The values can change when a program runs.
Before using a variable it must be declared.
We should try to give meaningful names to  variables.
"""example john, marks, sum etc."""
Now we will move back to our program.
"""Here, printf is the identifier name for this function."""
Come back to our slides.
Let us know about identifiers.
Identifiers are user defined names.
An identifier consists of letters and digits.
Both uppercase and lowercase letters are permitted.
First character must be an alphabet or underscore.
Now Come back to our program.
Here we have initialized the variables and constants.
Here we print them.
And this is our return statement.
Now click on Save.
Let us execute the program.
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space tokens dot c space hyphen o tok. Press Enter."""
"""To execute, type ./tok (dot slash tok)."""
The output is displayed.
We can see that here we have six values after the decimal point.
And here we have two values.
Now let us find out how this happened. Come back to our program.
This is because we have % point 2f here.
It denotes that we can print only two values after the decimal point.
Suppose here I want an output with three decimal places.
Let us replace % point 2f with % point 3f.
Now click on Save.
Come back to our terminal.
"""Compile as before, execute as before."""
We see here three values after the decimal point.
Now we will execute the same program in c++.
Come back to our program.
I will change a few things here.
First press Shift+Ctrl+s keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
Now save the file with an extension .cpp and click on Save.
Let us change the header file as iostream
Now  include the using statement.
And click on Save.
Now replace the printf statement with the  cout  statement since we use cout<< function to print a line in C++.
Click on Search for and replace text option.
Type here printf opening bracket “(”
"""And here in this column type, cout and two opening angle brackets “<<”."""
Now click on Replace All  and click on Close.
We don't need the format specifier and ''
Let us delete them.
Now delete the comma and  type two opening angle brackets.
Click on Save. Now delete the closing bracket.
Type two opening angle brackets again.
And within the double quotes type .
Let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space  tokens dot cpp space hyphen o space tok1."""
Here we have tok1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter tok for the file tokens.c.
Now press Enter.
"""To execute, type ./tok1 . Press Enter."""
Now let us move on to some common errors which we can come across.
Suppose here I will reassign a new value to b as 8.
Now click on Save. Let us see what happens.
Come back to our terminal.
Let me clear the prompt.
Now compile as before.
We see an error at line no.7 in our tokens. cpp file.
"""""""Assignment of read only variable 'b' """"."""
This is because 'b' is a constant. Constants are  fixed values.
They do not change during the execution of program.
Hence it is giving an error. Let us fix the error.
Delete this. Click on Save.
Let us execute again. Come back to our terminal.
Compile as before.
"""Execute as before. Yes, it is working."""
Now we will see another common error.
Switch back to our program.
Suppose here I will miss the single quotes. Click on Save.
Let us execute. Come back to our  terminal.
Compile as before.
We see an error at line no.9 in our tokens dot cpp file.
""""""" 'A' was not declared in the scope"""". Come back to our program."""
This is because anything within the single quotes is considered as a character value.
And here we have declared 'd' as a character variable.
Let us fix the error. Type single quotes at line no.9 here.
Now Click on Save. Let us execute.
Now Compile as before.
Execute as before. Yes it is working.
Now switch back to our slides.
"""Let us summarize.In this tutorial we learnt,"""
"""Data types eg. int, double, float etc."""
Variables eg. int a=2;
Identifiers eg. printf() and
Constant eg. double const b=4;
"""As an assignment,Write a  program to calculate the simple interest."""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Structures in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial we will learn,"""
What is a Structure.
Declaration of a structure.
We will do this through an example.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Operating System  version 11.10, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1."
Let us start with an introduction to Structure .
"""When one or more variables are grouped under one name, it is known as structure."""
Structure is used to group different data into one object.
It is called as compound data-type.
It is used to group related information together.
Now we will see the syntax to declare a structure.
"""Here, the keyword struct tells the compiler that a structure is declared."""
strcut_name is the name of the structure.
eg. struct employee;
You can give any name.
Now we will see how to declare a structure variable.
The syntax for this is:
struct struct_name and  struct_var;
struct_var is the variable of type struc_name.
"""example, struct employee addr;"""
addr is the variable of type employee.
Let us move on to our example.
"""I have already typed the program on the editor. So, let me open it."""
Note that our file name is structure.c.
In this program we will calculate the total marks of three subjects using structure.
Here we have declared a structure as student.
"""Then we have declared three integer variables as English, maths and science."""
Variables defined under the structure are called as members of the structure.
Here we have declared an integer variable 'total'.
"""Now we have declared a structure variable stud, stud is the variable of type student, it is used to access and modify the structure members."""
"Here we have modified the members by assigning them values as 75, 70 and 65."""
Here we calculate the total of three subjects.
Then we print the result.
Now click on Save .
"Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space structure.c space hyphen o space struct and press Enter."""
"""To execute, type (dot slash)./struct. Press Enter."""
The output is displayed as: Total is 210
Now we will execute the same program in C++ .
I will edit the same code.
"""First press Shift, Ctrl and  S keys simultaneously on the keyboard."""
Now save the file with an extension .cpp
and click on save.
Let's change the header file as iostream.
Now include the using statement
and click on save.
Structure declaration in C++ is same as in C.
"""So, no need to change anything here."""
At the end we will replace the printf statement with the cout  statement.
Delete the format specifier and (backslash n) .
Now delete the comma.
"""Here, delete the closing bracket"""
and type two opening angle brackets.
"""And within the double quotes, type  (backslash n)."""
Now click on Save.
Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space structure.cpp space hyphen o space struct1 ."""
Here we have struct1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameters struct for the file structure.c .
"""To execute, type (dot slash) ./struct1. Press Enter."""
The output is displayed as:Total is 210
You can see that the output is same as our C code.
Now let us go back to our slides.
"""We will summarize now. In this tutorial we learned,"""
"""Structure, Syntax of a structure"""
eg. struct struct_name;
To access members of a structure.
Eg: stud.maths = 75;
And to add the structure variables.
Eg: total = stud.eng + stud.maths + stud.science;

Welcome to the tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""So, what is the problem with this image here?"""
There is nothing properly visible what is there on this board.
"""So, I want to have this writing here to pop out."""
"""I want to keep the sky as it is, so I double this layer and I choose the Curves tool"""
and look into this part of the image.
I pull the curve up to get it lighter.
This looks quite good and now I am pulling this black point further up to get a bit dark here.
I think this should work out.
"""Now, I want the writing on the sign board into the bottom image."""
"""So, I choose a layer mask and fill the layer mask with Black."""
"""Now, I am back to my old image and work on the layer mask which has a white border."""
Now I select the Paint tool here
and select White as my Foreground Colour.
I select a Brush and enlarge it.
"""And now, I am painting on the layer mask."""
And perhaps I should zoom into the image.
This is better.
That's good.
You can see the keys which are pressed in my key indicator.
This looks way better.
Now I double this layer again and select Overlay mode and go down a bit with the Opacity to get a little bit more pop into background.
I think this looks better now.
Now I am ready to save this image.
"""I am working on copies here, so I can just click on Save or press Ctrl + S and of course I don’t want to save all these layers here and I am saving this as JPEG image."""
"""For uploading this image to the web, there is a need to resize it. So, I go to Image, Scale Image and I am scaling this down to 600 in Width."""
"""Now, I have to sharpen this a bit. So, I go to Filters >> Enhance >> Sharpen."""
I check for the art effects in the image and here you can see some light.
Now I am saving this as a copy.
"""I name it """"small"""" and save it."""
And I am finished with this image.
You should always remember two things while editing.
"""First is, if you want to change one part of the image and keep all the rest intact, then make a copy of that layer and do your changes and then put a layer mask on."""
Black hides the image and white reveals the stuff that’s in there.
"""Second thing, if you put second layer over it in Overlay mode, the image will have a better contrast and colours."""
These are two tricks to get very fast edit.
"""In this image, you can see at least two problems."""
"""First, I cut off the feet of these people which would have been nice to have them in there."""
And the second problem is these buildings are falling into the image because I held the camera upwards.
I select the Perspective tool.
I select Corrective (Backward) in the Direction dialog and I select the Grid as Preview.
I can select an Outline or the Image but I select the Grid.
"""And when I click into the image, I get this info. window here, with not so helpful information."""
"""So, I pull it out of way and now I have this grid here and all I have to do is align these grid lines with these verticals in the image."""
These grid lines will be either vertical or horizontal in the output image and this top line will be the top of the image.
"""And so, I am just pulling this over here."""
I look around in the image and I think this is fairly ok.
And now I press Transform.
And we have to wait till it transforms.
And here it is.
Now you see second problem here.
This land is not the best.
"""So, I have to crop this image."""
I go to my Crop tool
"""and I want to crop the side building out and leave only this, in there."""
It looks bit like a square. So I click on Fixed Aspect ratio and keep it as 1 by 1(1:1).
"""Now I have square crop,"""
keeping the people into the image.
I think this crop should work.
"""Click on it, and here it is."""
Now I select the Curves Tool.
Getting the high lines a little bit more up for more contrast into that.
"""Now, this image is finished too."""
This is the next image.
"""So, what to do with this image?"""
I select the Rotate tool and zoom into the image by pressing 1.
"""Here, I look for a good vertical section in the middle of the image and in Direction, I select Corrective (Backward) rotation."""
"""I select Cubic Interpolation and as Preview, I select the Grid."""
"""Now, I click into the image to get the grid lines and now I align these lines with the vertical structures of the house."""
And I think this is it.
I have this little window here open which shows 2.90 degrees and I click on Rotate and wait for the final result .
Here it is.
"""Well, it looks better."""
You can see here that I have plenty of distortion and I should look for the correction of that but now I am cropping this image.
I think this is ok.
I think I haven’t rotated the image properly.
Well! I haven’t rotated enough and I didn't select the right spot.
"""So, let’s do this again."""
I undo the steps back by pressing Ctrl + Z.
I select the Rotate tool again.
I don't change the settings which were selected previously and now I am setting the centre of the image into this TV tower here.
And now just aligning this to a TV tower.
"""The TV tower is the dominant part of the image and so if that isn’t straight, the image feels unstraight."""
This looks better.
And now I take the Crop tool and choose a crop with not too much negative space in it.
"""Now a last thing, perhaps a little bit of curves, to bring a bit more contrast into the image."""
This is OK. Now I am finished with this image.
"""This  image should be in portrait mode. So, I have to change this here."""
I go to Image >> Transform and Rotate 90 degree anticlockwise.
Now I have my image rotated.
"""When we rotate the image 90 degrees, it's without loss in the quality which is specially important with JPEG images."""
Now let’s get a little bit more contrast to this image and I use the Curves tool for doing that.
"""You can use Levels tool or others but I think, for me, the Curves tool is the best."""
Just put a slight ‘S’ curve on it and I think we are done. So I save this image.
"""Now, the next image."""
"""To put it all together, for quick editing of your images you need some basic tools."""
"""First, the Rotate tool."""
Use Corrective mode and the Grid as Preview and align the grid with the verticals or horizontals.
"""Then for tilting lines, you need the Perspective tool."""
Again use the Corrective mode and the Grid and align the grid with these verticals and horizontals.
"""For correcting the contrast and the lightness of the image, select the Curves tool and apply an ‘S’ curve. It is helpful in most cases. Or in some cases, if you want a softer image then inverted ‘S’ curve an"
And go to Image >> Transform menu where you can rotate the image and scale the output size.
"""Finally, Filters is important for quick editing."""
Go to Enhance and Sharpen.
"""After applying a lot of tools, as for example rotating or transformation tool, perspective tool or resizing, the image will get softer."""
And with sharpening you can redo that.
You should get familiar with layers.
"""First, double the layer and for example check out what happens in Overlay mode or other modes."""
There is a lot to explore and I will cover these in sometime.
"""You see, every time I change the Layer mode, I get a fully different image."""
"""And if you want to change only one  part of the image, add a layer mask and fill the stuff you want to see in the image with white."""
"""And the stuff you don’t want to see, in black."""
Gray is partly visible and it's transparent.
"""And I think, this was it for this week."""
And I hope to see you again next week. Good Bye.

Any eLearning based institution.
Let us see some of the websites built using Moodle.
Colleges like these.
Private universities like these.
Training institutes like this one.
Coaching institutes like this.
Individual teachers who want to offer their course online and many more.
Moodle has detailed statistics of usage on the following URL.
"""Here, you can check the registered Moodle websites from various countries."""
"""To install Moodle, we need:  Apache web-server,"""
"""a database like MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL and PHP."""
Moodle is a resource consuming software.
Recommended hardware for running Moodle are:
"""Disk Space: 200 MB for Moodle code plus space to store content. However, 5GB is a realistic minimum."""
"""Processor: 1 Gigahertz minimum, but 2 Gigahertz dual core or more is recommended."""
"""Memory: 512MB minimum, but 1GB or more is recommended."""
These requirements may change based on the expected load on the system.
For example: number of courses and expected simultaneous logins.
"""At the time of making of this series, Moodle 3.3 was the latest stable version."""
It is always recommended to work with the latest stable version that is available.
Moodle 3.3 requires the following:
Apache 2.x (or higher version) MariaDB 5.5.30 (or any higher version)  and
PHP 5.4.4 (or any higher version)
"""For this series, we have used the following OS and software: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04"""
"""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30 and Moodle 3.3"""
This Moodle series is divided into 2 parts -
One for Moodle site administrators and  another for teachers.
"""Moodle site Administrators:   will install Moodle on the server,"""

Hello everyone.Welcome to this tutorial on Parsing Data.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to download FASTA and GenBank files from NCBI database website."""
"""And, Parse data files using functions in Sequence Input/Output module."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate biochemistry or bioinformatics"""
and basic Python programming.
Refer to the Python tutorials at the given link.
"To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu OS version 14.10, Python version 2.7.8"
Ipython interpretor version 2.3.0
Biopython version 1.64 and * Mozilla Firefox browser 35.0.
"""Scientific data in biology is generally stored in text files such as FASTA, GenBank, EMBL, Swiss-Prot etc."""
Data files can be downloaded from the database websites.
"""Open the website link given below, in any web browser."""
A web-page opens.
Let us download FASTA and GenBank files for human insulin gene.
"""In the search box, type: """"human insulin"""", click on Search button."""
The web-page shows many files for human insulin gene.
"""For demonstration, I will select 4 files with the name “Homo sapiens Insulin mRNA”."""
I will choose files that have less than 500 base pairs.
"""Click on the check-box to select the file, to download."""
"""Bring the cursor to the “Send to” option, located at the top right corner of the page."""
"""Click on the small selection button with a down arrow, present next to the “Send to” button."""
"""Under the heading “Choose destination”, click on File option."""
"""You can save this file in any file format, listed under format drop-down list box."""
Choose FASTA from the given options.
Then click on Create file option.
A dialog-box appears on the screen.
"""Select Open with, click on OK."""
A file opens in a text editor.
"""The file shows 4 records, since we had selected four files to download."""
The first line in each record is an identifier line.
It starts with a “greater than (>)” symbol.
This is followed by a sequence.
Save the file in your home folder as “sequence.fasta'”.
Close the text editor.
"Follow the same steps as above, to download the files in GenBank format for the same files selected earlier."
Select the file format as GenBank.
Create a file. Open with a text editor.
Notice that the sequence file in GenBank format has more features than a FASTA file.
"""Save the file as """"sequence.gb"""" in your home folder. Close the text editor."""
"""For demonstration purpose, we need a FASTA file with a single record."""
"""For this, clear the earlier selection by again clicking on the check boxes."""
"""Now, select the file “Human insulin gene complete cds”."""
Click on the check-box.
And follow the same steps shown earlier to save the file in the home folder.
"""Save the file as """"insulin.fasta""""."""
Biological data stored in these files can be extracted and modified using Biopython libraries.
Close the text-editor.
Extracting data from data files is called as Parsing.
Most file formats can be parsed using functions available in SeqIO module.
"""Most commonly used functions of SeqIO module are: parse, read, write and convert."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and t keys simultaneously."""
"""Start Ipython by typing """"ipython"""" at the prompt. Press Enter."""
"""Next, import """"SeqIO"""" module from Bio package."""
"""At the prompt, type: from Bio import SeqIO. Press Enter."""
We will start with the most important function “parse”.
"""For demonstration, I will use a FASTA file that has many records which we had downloaded earlier from the database."""
"""For simple FASTA parsing, type the following at the prompt."""
"""Here, we are using the parse function to read the contents of the sequence.fasta file."""
"""For the output, print record id, sequence present in the record and also the length of the sequence."""
Also notice that the parse function is used to read sequence data as Sequence record objects.
It is generally used with a for loop.
"""It can accept two arguments, the first one is the file name to read the data."""
The second specifies the file format.
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
"""The output shows the identifier line, followed by the sequence contained in the file, also the length of the sequence for all the records in the file."""
Notice that the FASTA format does not specify the alphabet.
"""So, the output does not specifies it as a DNA sequence."""
The same steps can be repeated for parsing GenBank file.
For Demonstration we will use the GenBank file which we have downloaded earlier from the database.
Press up-arrow key to get the lines of code which we had used earlier.
Change the file name to sequence.gb .
Change the file format to genbank.
The rest of the code remains same.
Press Enter key twice to get the output.
"""Here too the output shows the record id, sequence and the length of the sequence for all the records in the file."""
Notice that the GenBank format specifies the sequence as DNA sequence.
"""Similarly, Swiss-prot and EMBL files can be parsed using the same code as above."""
If your file contains a single record then type the following lines for parsing.
"""Here, we will use the previously saved FASTA file with a single record, that is, insulin.fasta as an example."""
Notice that we have used read function instead of parse function. Press Enter.
The output shows the contents for the file insulin.fasta.
It shows the sequence as sequence record object.
"""And other attributes such as GI, accession number and description."""
We can also view the individual attributes of this record as follows.
"""At the prompt, type: record dot seq. Press Enter."""
The output shows the sequence present in the file.
"""To view the identifiers for this record, type: record dot id. Press Enter."""
The output shows the GI number and accession number etc.
You can use the function described above to parse the data files of your choice.
"""Now, let's summarize."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:to download FASTA and GenBank files from NCBI database website and use parse and read functions from the SeqIO module"""
"""to extract data such as record ids, description and sequences from FASTA and GenBank files."""
"""Now, for the assignment-"""
Download FASTA files for nucleotide sequence of your choice from NCBI database.
Convert the file of sequences to their reverse complements.
Your completed assignment should have the following lines of code.
Use parse function to load nucleotide sequences from the FASTA file.
"""Next, print reverse complements using the Sequence object’s built in reverse complement method."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Extensions in Mozilla Firefox.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Extensions or Add-ons, installing Extensions, recommended Extensions."""
Here we are using Firefox 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04.
"""By default, the yahoo home page opens."""
What are Extensions or Add-ons?
Extensions allow you to:
Add new features to the Firefox browser.
Enhance existing features.
Customize the Firefox browser to suit your preferences.
Extensions are a part of the Firefox browser
and extend the browser’s capabilities.
"""For example, you can install extensions that:"""
Block advertisements or pop-ups.
Compare prices of commodities and even
display weather updates.
Let’s install the Grab and Drag extension.
Grab and Drag let’s you scroll through web pages in various ways.
It is similar to the 'grab and drag' function in Adobe Acrobat.
"""From the Menu bar, click Tools and Add-ons."""
The Add-ons Manager tab opens.
"""Alternately, you can also press the Ctrl+Shift+A keys together to open the Add-ons Manager tab."""
The left panel in Add-ons Manager displays the available options.
"""Notice, by default the option Get Add-ons is selected."""
The right panel displays information for the option selected in the left panel.
"""So, the right panel defines Add-ons and tells you how to get started with add-ons."""
It even lists some Add-ons you can install.
"""Now, we shall install the new Add-on- Grab and Drag."""
"""First, in the Search bar, located on the top-right corner, type: Grab and Drag. Press Enter."""
"""The right panel, now lists the add-ons that best match the name we searched for."""
"""Also, notice that all the add-ons that have the word drag in the title are displayed."""
"""Notice that the first name on the list, Grab and Drag, is an exact match."""
Click on Install.
"""As with most softwares, some add-ons too may have 'end-user license agreements'."""
"""On the End-User License Agreement dialog box, click Accept and Install."""
The Add-on downloading progress bar appears.
"""Next, a message that the 'add-on will be installed"""
when you restart Mozilla Firefox'is displayed.
Click on Restart Now.
The Firefox browser closes and reopens.
The Add-ons Manager opens in a new tab.
Notice that the Grab and Drag extension is displayed in the right panel of the Extensions tab.
"""Following the previous steps, let’s install another extension Scrap Book."""
Scrap Book allows you to save and manage Web page collections.
Notice that the installation progress bar and the message to close and restart Firefox are not displayed separately.
They are displayed in the Scrap Book bar.
Click Restart Now.
Scrap Book is installed in Firefox.
Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.
"""In the Firefox browser, open Add-ons Manager."""
"""Install a new add-on from the Featured Add-ons list, in the Get Add-ons option."""
"""You manage extensions that is- add, delete or update them"""
using the Extensions option
in the Add-ons Manager.
"""In the Firefox browser, click the Add-ons Manager tab."""
"""From the left panel, click Extensions."""
The right panel now displays the Extensions that are installed on your computer.
"""To learn more about ScrapBook, select it and click More."""
Details about Scrap Book are displayed.
Click on the website link to learn all about the Extensions.
"""Now, from the left panel, click on the Extension option."""
"""Notice, for each Extension you can set preferences, disable or remove it."""
Select Grab and Drag and click on Preferences.
You can set your preferences using this dialog box.
Click Cancel to exit the dialog box.
"""Now, select Scrap Book and click Preferences."""
Notice that the Scrap Book Options dialog box is different from the Grab and Drag Preferences dialog box.
"""Therefore, each Extension has different settings that can be changed."""
"""If the Preferences button is not visible for an Extension,"""
it implies that there are no preferences for it.
Click Close to exit the ScrapBook Options dialog box.
"""As with most softwares, add-ons too are updated on a regular basis."""
"""To update Scrap Book, select it, right-click and click Find Updates."""
"""If Updates are found, the Update button is displayed."""
Click on it to update the add-on.
"""As there are no updates for Scrap Book, the Update button is not displayed."""
"""Finally, if you do not want to use an Extension click the Disable button."""
"""And to remove an Extension from your computer, click Remove."""
We have learnt all about Extensions!
You can now use Extensions to streamline tasks by adding more functionalities to Firefox.
You can use the Get Add-ons option to learn about a number of Add-ons.
You can then select and install Add-ons that are most relevant or useful to you.
"""To learn more about Firefox Extensions, please visit the Firefox website."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: Extensions, Installing Extensions, Recommended Extensions."""
Search for an extension called WebMail Notifier and
install it on your computer.
Find out about the features of this extension and how you can use them to check unread mails from your mail accounts.
Disable the Extension.
Then remove it from Firefox.
It summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project.

Welcome to this tutorial on Manipulating Sequences.
"""In this tutorial, we will use Biopython tools: To generate a random DNA sequence"""
Slice a DNA sequence at specified locations
Join two sequences together to form a new sequence that is to concatenate
Find the length of the sequence
Count the number of individual bases or part of the string
Find a particular base or part of the string.
Convert a sequence object to a mutable sequence object.
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with undergraduate Biochemistry or Bioinformatics"""
and basic Python programming.
"""If not, refer to the Python tutorials at the given link."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: * Ubuntu OS version 14.10"""
Python version 2.7.8
Ipython interpreter version 2.3.0
Biopython version 1.64.
Let me open the terminal and start ipython interpreter.
"""Press Ctrl, Alt and t keys simultaneously."""
"""At the prompt, type: """"ipython"""" and press Enter."""
Ipython prompt appears on the screen.
"""Using Biopython, we can generate a sequence object for a random DNA sequence of any specified length."""
Let us now generate a sequence object for a DNA sequence of 20 bases.
"""At the prompt, type: """"import random"""", press Enter."""
"""Next, import Seq module from Bio package."""
Often Seq is pronounced as seek.
"""At the prompt, type: From Bio dot Seq import Seq. Press Enter."""
We will use Bio.Alphabet module to specify the alphabets in the DNA sequence.
Type: from Bio dot Alphabet import generic underscore dna. Press Enter.
Type the following command to create a sequence object for the random DNA sequence.
Store the sequence in a variable dna1.
"""Please note: in this command, use two single quotes instead of a double quote. Press Enter."""
"""For the output, type: dna1. Press Enter."""
The output shows the sequence object for the random DNA sequence.
"""If you want a new sequence, press up-arrow key to get the same command as above. Press Enter."""
"""For the output, type the variable name dna1. Press Enter."""
The output shows a new DNA sequence which is different from the first one.
About Sequence Objects:
The sequence objects usually act like normal Python strings.
"""So, follow the normal conventions as you do for Python strings."""
"""In Python, we count the characters in the string starting from 0, instead of 1."""
The first character in the sequence is position zero.
Back to the terminal.
Often you may need to work with only a part of the sequence.
"""Now, let's see how to extract parts of the string and store them as sequence objects."""
"""For example, we will slice the DNA sequence at two positions."""
"""First, between bases 6 and 7."""
This will extract a fragment from the beginning of the sequence to the 6th base in the sequence.
The second slice will be between bases 11 and 12.
The second fragment will be from the 12th base to the end of the sequence.
"""Type the following command, at the prompt, to extract the first fragment."""
String1 equal to dna1 within brackets 0 colon 6.
string1 is the variable to store the first fragment.
The rest of the command follows as in normal Python.
Enclosed in these brackets are the start and the stop positions separated by a colon.
The positions are inclusive of the start but exclusive of the stop position. Press Enter.
"""To view the output, type: """"string1"""", press Enter."""
The output shows the first fragment as the sequence object.
"""To extract the second string from the sequence, press up-arrow key and edit the command as follows:"""
Change the name of the variable to string2 and positions to 11 and 20.
"""For the output, type: """"string2"""". Press Enter."""
Now we have the 2nd fragment also as a sequence object.
"""Let us concatenate, that is, add the two strings together to form a new fragment."""
Store the new sequence in a variable dna2.
Type: dna2 equal to string1 plus string2. Press Enter.
Please note: we cannot add sequences with incompatible alphabets.

Go to File. Click on New.
These are the default canvas sizes that are available.
"""My canvas is, by default, in A4 size."""
"""So, I will leave it as it is."""
"""If it is not so, on your machine, then select A4 size."""
Let us now change some settings.
Go to File. Click on Document properties.
A dialog box opens up where we can find various tabs and options.
Let us learn about them one by one.
"""In the first tab Page, click on the Default units drop-down list."""
"""As I click one-by-one, observe that the unit of the ruler changes."""
Let me keep the unit as pixels.
Background option helps to change the transparency and color of the background.
"""When we click on it, a new dialog box appears."""
Move the RGB sliders to the left and right.
"""To make the background colour visible on the canvas, move the alpha slider towards the right."""
Now the transparency changes to the selected 'RGB' values.
"""Observe that the color on the background option, in the Document properties window, changes as I move."""
Bring the Alpha slider back to the extreme left and close the dialog box.
"""Under Page size, we find many options."""
We can change the size of the canvas using these options too.
"""As I click, observe the change in the canvas size."""
Let us keep the page size as A4.
Orientation can be changed to either Portrait or Landscape.
Click on both the options and observe the change on the canvas.
We can change the width and height of the canvas using the Width and Height parameters.
"""Click on the Units drop-down list. Here, we can change the units according to our requirement."""
Let us now change the units to pixels.
Click on Resize page to content option.
The various available options open up.
We can set margins for all the sides here.
"""After setting the margins, one needs to click on the button Resize page to drawing or selection."""
Next is the Border option. We can see 3 check-box options here.
"""To demonstrate these options, let me first draw an ellipse in this manner."""
"""The first option makes the page border, that is, the border of the canvas visible."""
Uncheck this option and observe that the borders disappear.
"""Then again, check the option and observe that the borders re-appear."""
The second option sets the border on top of the drawing so that it is clearly visible.
Once again check and uncheck this option and observe what happens on the canvas.
The third option shows a shadow of the canvas on the right and bottom.
"""Notice here, the border to the right and bottom are thicker than the other two sides."""
Uncheck the third option and observe that this shadow disappears.
We can use all these options according to our requirement and preference.
The Border color option allows us to decide the color of the border.
Let us leave the default border color as it is.
"""Next, click on Guides tab."""
Guides help you align text and graphic objects on the canvas.
You can create ruler guides here.
Click on the vertical ruler and drag a guideline.
Now check and uncheck the first option Show Guides
and observe the guideline appears and disappears on the canvas.
Guide color is the color of the guideline.
Highlight color is the color of the guideline when it is being dragged to a certain position.
The default colours of the guide and the highlight are shown here.
You can change it as per your preference.
I will leave the default colors as they are.
Snap guides while dragging option helps to snap the objects or bounding box to the nearest guidelines while dragging.
"""Next, click on the Grids tab."""
"""Using this option, we can set the grid that appears behind the artwork on the canvas."""
Grids are helpful to position objects on the canvas but they do not get printed.
Click on the drop-down list.
Rectangular grid and Axonometric grid are the two types of grids available.
Select Rectangular grid and click on the New button.
"""Immediately, a grid is formed on the canvas background."""
We can set the grid properties as per our requirement using the available options.
We can remove the grid by clicking on the Remove button at the bottom.
"""In a similar way, you can try the options for Axonometric grid too."""
The options in the next 3 tabs will be covered in the advanced level tutorials in this series.
"""Now, let us start creating the poster."""
"""So, first let me delete the ellipse and the guideline."""
"""For our poster, we will first design a background."""
Click on the Rectangle tool.
Draw a large rectangle that covers the whole canvas.
Color it with light blue gradient.
"""Next, draw a header area on the top"""
and a footer area at the bottom of the canvas using the Bezier tool.
We will color it blue.
Let us import the Spoken Tutorial logo now.
This logo has been provided to you in the Code Files link.
"""So, first of all, pause the tutorial. Click on Code Files and download the zip file."""
Now unzip the folder and save it in your preferred location on your machine.
Now come back to our Inkscape document.
Go to File menu. Click on Import.
Go to folder where the logo is saved.
Select the Spoken Tutorial logo and click on Open.
A new dialog box opens up. Click on OK.
Now the logo is imported on our canvas.
Resize it to 100×100 pixels.
Place it on the top left corner of the header area.
"""Now, type the text Spoken Tutorial."""
Make it Bold.
Change the text font size to 48.
Place it to the right of the logo.
"""After this, type the text “partner with us...help bridge the digital divide”."""
Change the font size to 20.
"""Next, let us add some text."""
I have already saved a sample text in a LibreOffice Writer document on my machine.
This sample text has been provided to you in the Code Files.
Please locate it in your saved folder.
"""Now, I will copy and paste this text in the empty space on my poster."""
Change the font size to 28.
Set the line spacing.
Create bullets and place before each sentence.
We will add 2 images below that.
"""As before, import them one by one."""
I have saved them in the images folder.
These images have been provided to you in the Code Files.
Please locate them in your saved folder.
Select the images and resize them.
Move them to the bottom area of the poster.
Let us write the contact details at the footer area.
"""Once again, copy and paste the text from LibreOffice Writer document."""
Change the font size to 18.
"""Now, our poster is ready."""
"""Next, let us learn how to save it in pdf format."""
Go to File and click on Save As.
A dialog box appears.
Choose the folder in which you want to save.
I will choose Desktop.
Change the format to pdf by clicking on the drop-down list at the bottom right of the dialog box.
"""Here, in the Name field, type: Spoken-Tutorial-Poster.pdf."""
Then click on Save button.
Our poster is saved in the Desktop.
Let us go to our Desktop and check our poster.
"""So, we have the poster in pdf format."""
Let us summarize. In this tutorial we learnt to:
Change the Document properties
Design an A4 poster
Saving the poster in pdf.
Here is an assignment for you-
create an A4 poster for Spoken Tutorial Project.
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Question bank in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:  Question bank in Moodle"""
Categories of questions and How to add questions to the question bank.
This tutorial is recorded using:  Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04
Moodle 3.3   And Firefox web browser You may use any web browser of your choice.
"""However, Internet Explorer should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
This tutorial assumes that your site administrator has registered you as a teacher And assigned at least one course to you.
It also assumes that You have uploaded some course material for your course.
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
Switch to the browser and login to your Moodle site as a teacher.
"""I have provided a text file with all the text that is used in this tutorial, in the Code files link. Please download the file named “Mytextfile.txt” and open it on your machine."""
Click on the Calculus course in the left navigation menu.
We will begin by learning about Question banks.
"""A Question bank is a collection of questions, mostly organized by topics"""
Questions in the Question bank can be reused in multiple quizzes.
This helps to create different quizzes for each academic year or for different batches.
Switch back to the browser.
Click on the gear icon at the top right and then click on the More… link at the end.
We are brought to the Course Administration page.
Scroll down and locate the section named Question bank.
Click on the Categories link in this section.
Look at the Add category section.
Click on the Parent category dropdown.
Here Top is the top level category for this course.
"""Select Default for Calculus, if it is not already selected by default."""
"""In the Name field, type Basic Calculus."""
"""Then click on Add Category button at the bottom of the page. Likewise, we can add more categories."""
"""Create a hierarchy of categories for the Calculus course, like I have done here."""
Go to the questions creation page by clicking on the Questions tab.
Click on Create a new question button at the bottom.
A pop-up window opens.
Select the type of question that you wish to add.
Detailed description about the question type is seen on the right side.
I will select Multiple choice.
Click on Add button at the bottom of the pop-up.
"""Now, select the category for which you want to add the question. I will choose Evolutes."""
"""In the Question name field, type MCQ with single correct answer."""
Type the following question in the Question text area. You can copy-paste the text from the Mytextfile.txt file.
The Default Mark is set to 1 and I will let it be as 1.
Next option is General feedback. The text here is shown to the student after he/she has submitted the quiz.
"""This can be used to show the detailed solution of the question, also. Type or copy-paste the text as I have done here."""
"""Now, click on the One or multiple answers dropdown."""
Here we see 2 options- Multiple answers allowed One answer only
I’ll show you how both options work.
Let me first choose One answer only.
"""The Shuffle the choices checkbox is checked, by default. This ensures that the answer choices within the question, are shuffled for each quiz attempt."""
Scroll down to see the Answers section.
Notice that every option here is associated with a grade and feedback.
Type Choice 1 as shown here.
"""Now for this question, Choice 1 is the correct answer."""
Therefore I will select 100% in the Grade.
"""In the Grade dropdown, we can also allot partial marks or negative marks to every choice."""
You can explore these later when you are more proficient with Moodle.
"""Feedback for students who choose this answer, can be written in the Feedback text area. I will type “Correct”."""
"""Fill the rest of the choices and grades, as I have done here."""
Now scroll down and click on Multiple Tries section to expand it.
"""Notice here - the Penalty for each incorrect try field is set by default, to 33.33%"""
This means a student will be penalised for every wrong answer.
You can leave it as it is or change it to any of the other percentage options shown here.
"""I will select 0%, as I don’t wish to penalise my students for wrong answers."""
Then scroll down and click on Save changes button at the bottom of the page.
We can see that our question has been added to the Question Bank.
Notice that there are 4 icons next to the question title of the question.
"""These are to edit, duplicate, preview and delete the question."""
Click on Preview icon to see how the question will appear in the quiz.
The selected question and its options opens in a pop-up window.
"""Click on Fill in correct responses button. This helps you to verify the questions, the choices and the correct answer."""
Click on Submit and finish button.
"""This will show the feedback that the student will see, after answering the question."""
"""Whenever you add a new question, always preview it to cross check."""
Click on Close preview button to close this pop-up window.
Let us now create an MCQ which has more than one correct answer.
"""Following the previous steps, I have created another MCQ. Please do so likewise."""
"""In One or multiple answers dropdown, this time I will select Multiple answers allowed."""
Enter the choices 1 and 2 and their respective grades as shown. Here I have selected 50% grade for both.
A student who marks only 1 correct answer gets 0.5 marks.
And the student who marks both correct answers gets 1 mark.
Enter the choices 3 and 4 and their respective grades as shown.
And I will keep Penalty for each incorrect try field as 0%.
Then scroll down and click on Save changes button.
"""Next, let’s add a Short answer question."""
"""The student will be expected to type in a word or phrase, in response to the question."""
Click on Create a new question button and double-click on Short answer option.
Create the question as shown.
"""In Case sensitivity dropdown, select No, case is unimportant."""
The correct answer to this question is “same logarithmic spiral”
I am willing to give full marks to a student if whose answer is either: “same spiral” or  “same logarithmic spiral”
"""However, if the student writes “logarithmic spiral” as the answer, I will give half mark."""
Scroll down to the answers section.
Fill in Answer 1 and 2 and their respective grades as shown.
Notice the asterix in Answer 1 text. Asterix can be used as a wildcard to match any character.
So for eg: A student writes The evolute of a logarithmic spiral is the same logarithmic spiral. This answer will be awarded full marks.
Fill in Answer 3 and its respective grade as shown.
Notice there is no asterix before the answer text.
So for example: A student writes The evolute of a logarithmic spiral is not the same logarithmic spiral. This answer will be not be awarded any marks.
Fill in Answer 4 and its respective grade as shown.
Notice that I have awarded only 50% marks to this answer.
"""In the feedback textarea, type “You need to specify that it’s the same spiral and not any spiral.”"""
This explanation will be shown to the student as feedback.
"""Once again, I will keep Penalty for each incorrect try field as 0%."""
Then scroll down and click on Save changes button.
Let us now add a Numerical question.
Click on Create a new question button and double click on Numerical option.
"""The answer to this question is 5mm. However, I am okay with the student answering anywhere between 4.5mm and 5.5mm."""
The error margin here is 0.5.
Scroll down to the Answers section.
"""Enter the Answers, Error and grades as shown."""
Expand the Unit handling section. There are 3 options in the Unit handling dropdown.
"""I will select the option - The unit must be given, and will be graded."""
"""The Unit penalty field, by default, shows 0.1 I will make it 0.5."""
So the student will get half of the marks if they write the answer without mentioning the unit.
"""In the Units are input using dropdown, I will select the text input element option."""
This means the student has to type the unit along with the answer.
Expand the Units section.
Write Unit as mm and multiplier is 1. This means the answer choices are in mm.
"""Once again, I will keep Penalty for each incorrect try field as 0%."""
And then scroll down and click on Save changes button.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: Question bank in Moodle"""
Categories of questions and How to add questions to the question bank.
Here is a small assignment for you: Add more questions in the question bank.
Refer to the Assignment link of this tutorial for details.
Pause this tutorial and resume when done.
We should now have 10 questions in this question bank. 6 of them are in Evolutes and 4 in Involutes subcategory.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Method overloading in java.
In this tutorial we will learn:
What is method overloading.
And 	to overload method.
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10  OS Java Development kit 1.6 And Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create methods and
to overload constructor in java using eclipse.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
What is method overloading?
Define two or more methods with same name within a class.
They must differ in number or types of parameters.
These methods are called overloaded methods.
The process is called method overloading.
Let us now see how to overload a method.
"""In eclipse, I have a class Addition."""
"""Inside the class,  we will  declare two integer variables."""
"""So, type: int a  equal to 10 and int b  equal to 5."""
Let us create a method to add these two integers.
"""So, type:  void add parentheses."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: System dot out dot println();."""
Inside  parentheses a+b.
"""So, this method will give us the sum of two integer variables."""
Let us create another method which takes two parameters.
"""So, type: void addTwoNumbers()."""
Within parentheses int num1 comma int num2.
"""Then, within curly brackets System dot out dot println num1 plus num2."""
"""So, this method will give us the sum of two  values that are passed as arguments to this method."""
Let us create an object of the class and call the methods.
"""So, in  the  main method  type: Addition i.e the class name  obj  equal to new Addition parentheses semicolon."""
Then Obj.add();
And Obj.addTwonumbers();  within parentheses
we  will pass  two arguments.
Suppose if we pass floating point values.
"""So, type 2.5 comma and an  integer 3."""
We get an error. It states that:  The method addTwoNumbers  int comma int  of the  class addition is not applicable for the arguments double comma int.
"""So, what we do is, in the method instead of int we will give double."""
So replace int by double . Save the file.
We also  know that Java automatically i.e. implicitly coverts int into double.
"""So, here we can pass integer arguments as well."""
"""In the output, we see the sum of two integer variables"""
and the sum of two numeric arguments that we passed.
"""Now, we see that both the methods perform same operation."""
The difference is that the first method  has no parameters while the second method has  parameters.
"""So, in such cases java provides us with method overloading."""
"""So, what we do is, give same name to both the methods."""
"""So, replace addTwoNumbers() with add(), also change here."""
We will define one more method with same operation.
"""So, type: void add()."""
Within parentheses int n1 comma int n2 comma int n3.
"""So, we have given three parameters."""
"""Then, within curly brackets System dot out dot println()."""
Within parentheses n1 plus n2 plus n3.
"""So, this method will give sum of three numbers."""
Let us call this method.
"""So, type: obj dot add() 1 comma 5 comma 4."""
Save and Run.
"""In the output, we see the sum of three number i.e 10."""
"""So,Java compiler overloads the proper method depending on the parameters."""
It checks the number and type of parameters passed.
"""So, as a programmer we don't have to worry about the method name."""
Nor even the type or number of arguments we  passed.
We can create one more method which appends strings.
So we will create one more overload  method.
Type: void add String s1 comma String s2.
Within curly brackets System dot out dot println().
Within parentheses s1 plus s2.
Then we will call  this method.
"""So, type: obj dot add."""
Within parentheses in double quotes Hello comma in double quotes space World.
"""So, in the output we see Hello space World."""
"""So, the add method with two string arguments, appends the string."""
Suppose now we declare add method with return type.
"""So, type: int add parentheses  no  parameter and curly brackets."""
"""We get an error.  It states that """"Duplicate method add() in type Addition""""."""
This is because we have already declared a   method add() with no parameters.
"""So, remember that to overload a  method, the parameters must differ."""
Having different return types will not overload the method.
"""So, remove this method  and Save the file."""
This is how method overloading is done in java.
"""So, in this tutorial we learnt:"""
About method overloading.
To overload method.
And advantage of method overloading.
"""For self assessment: Create a method subtract that subtracts number,"""
Overload it.
More information on this mission is available at [1].
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Non-static block in java.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
About non-static block
When   a non-static block is executed?
Simple example of non-static block
And Why we need constructors?
Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10 Java Development Environment jdk 1.6 And  Eclipse IDE 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
how to create a constructor in Java using Eclipse.
"""Now we will see, what a non-static block is."""
Any code written between two curly brackets is a non-static block.
We can see the syntax here.
When is a  non-static block  executed ?
A  non-static block is executed for each object that is created.
It executes before the constructor's execution.
It can initialize instance member variables of the class.
Any other execution like calculation could also be given in the block.
"""Now, let us switch to Eclipse and try to use a non-static block."""
I have already opened a class named NonStaticTest in Eclipse.
I also have a created a class named A .
"""Now inside class A, I will first create a variable of type int."""
"""So, type: int a semicolon, then press Enter."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes Non static block of an instance of Class A semicolon."""
"""Then, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The value of a is plus a semicolon."""
Now we will declare a constructor.
"""So, type: public A opening and closing brackets open the curly brackets press Enter."""
Then type:  System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes Constructing object of type A semicolon.
Then type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The value of a is plus a  semicolon.
Now save this file.
Inside   class NonStaticTest in Eclipse let us create an object of the class A.
"""So, type: A space a1 equal to  new space A opening and closing brackets semicolon."""
"""Next line, we will create one more object of class A."""
"""So, type: A  space a2 equal to new  space A opening and closing brackets semicolon."""
"""Now,  Save and run the file. So, press Ctrl & S and Ctrl & F11 keys."""
We get the output as follows:
"""As we can see when the first object is created, the non-static block is executed."""
Non-static block   of an instance  of class A  and the instance variable 'a' is initialized to 0.
Only after that the constructor is executed. Constructing object of type A.
"""And here, the instance variable is again initialized to 0."""
"""Then again when the second object is created, the non-static block is executed."""
This process is repeated.
We can have multiple non-static blocks in a class.
In this case they execute in the sequence in which they appear in the class.
We can try that now.
Include one more block after the first one in class A.
"""So, again type inside curly brackets:"""
System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes Second Non static block of an instance of Class A semicolon.
Then type: System  dot  out  dot println within brackets and double quotes The value of a is  plus  a  semicolon .
"""Now, save this file , press Ctrl & S key  simultaneously then press  Ctrl & F11   to run the program."""
We get the output as follows.
"""We see that after the first block is executed, the second is executed."""
Only then the constructor is executed.
Now  you might feel why do we need constructors.
The answer is we don't need the default constructor.
But the non-static block cannot be parameterized.
You cannot have objects taking values from out side.
So non-static block is not a substitute for constructor.
"""So, let us summarize."""
In this tutorial we have learnt
about non-static block and how to use this block.
For self assessment: Create a class named B.
Create a non-static block and a constructor as shown in the tutorial.
Create an object of class B in the class NonStaticTest already created.
Check the output.
More information on this mission is available at http://spoken-tutorial.org/NMEICT-Intro.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on First C program.
"""In this tutorial, we  will learn"""
How to write a simple C program
How to compile it
How to execute it We will also explain some common errors and their solutions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using"""
Ubuntu operating system version 11.10 and gcc Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
"""To practice this tutorial,"""
You should be familiar with Ubuntu Operating System and an Editor.
Some editors are vim and gedit.
I will use 'gedit' in this tutorial.
For relevant tutorials please visit our website which is as shown. http://spoken-tutorial.org
Let me tell you how to write a C program through an example.
"""Open the terminal window  by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""Now let's open the text editor. So, at the prompt, type"""
“gedit” space “talk” dot “c” space “&” sign.
We use ampersand (&) to free up the prompt.
Please note that all the C files will  have  extension  “.c”(dot C).
"""Now Press Enter,"""
the text editor has opened.
Let us start to write a program.
Type double slash “//” space
“My first C program”.
"""Here, double slash is used to comment the line."""
Comments are used to understand the flow of program.
It is useful for documentation.
It gives us information about the program.
The double slash is called as single line comment.
"""Type (hash) “#include” space opening bracket , closing bracket."""
"""It is always a good practice to complete the brackets first, and then start writing inside it."""
"""Now  Inside the bracket, type“stdio” “(dot).” “h” ."""
stdio.h is a header file.
A program must contain this header file when it uses standard input/output  functions.
"""type “int” space “main” opening bracket, closing bracket."""
main is a special function.
It denotes that the execution of the program begins from this line.
The opening bracket and closing bracket is called as parenthesis.
Parenthesis followed by main is to tell the user that main is a function.
Here the int main function takes no arguments.
It returns a value of type integer.
We will learn about data types in another tutorial.
Now  Let us switch to the slides to know more about  main function. Let us go to the next slide.
Every program should have one main() function.
There should NOT be more than one main function.
Otherwise the compiler cannot locate the beginning of the program.
The empty pair of parentheses indicates that main has no arguments.
The concept of arguments will be discussed in detail in the upcoming tutorials.
Now let us come back to our program.
Type opening curly bracket “{”.
The opening curly bracket marks the beginning of the function main.
Then  Type  closing curly  bracket “}”.
The closing curly bracket indicates the end of the function main.
"""Now Inside the bracket   press Enter twice,"""
move the cursor one line up.
Indentation makes the code easier to read.
It also helps to locate errors faster.
So let us give three space here
And  Type “printf”  opening bracket closing bracket “()” .
printf is a standard C function to print the output on the terminal.
"""Here, inside the brackets, within the double quotes."""
"""Anything within the double quotes, in the printf statement, will be printed on the terminal."""
Type“Talk To a Teacher backslash n”.
Backslash n “” signifies newline.
"""As a result, after execution of the printf function, the cursor moves to the new line."""
Every C statement must end with a semicolon “;”.
"""Hence, type it at the end of this line."""
Semicolon acts as a statement terminator.
Now press Enter give three space here.
And type “return” space “0” and a semicolon.
This statement returns the integer zero.
An integer has to be returned for this function because the function type is int.
The return statement marks the end of executable statements.
We will learn more about the returned values in another tutorial.
"""Now click on""""Save"""" button to save the file."""
It is a good habit to save files frequently.
This will protect you from sudden power failures.
It will also be useful in case the applications were to crash.
"""Let  us now compile the program, come back to a  terminal."""
"""Type “gcc” space “talk.c” space hyphen “-o” space “myoutput”,"""
"""gcc is the compiler,"""
talk.c is our filename .
-o myoutput says that the executable should go to the file myoutput.
Now Press Enter.
We see that the program is compiled.
"""By typing ls space (hypen) -lrt, we can see that myoutput is the last file to be created."""
"""To execute the program, type (dot slash)“./myoutput” , press Enter."""
Here the output is displayed as “Talk To a Teacher”.
"""As I said before, return is the last statement to be executed."""
"""Thus, after the return statement nothing will be executed. Let us try it out."""
come back to our program.
"""After the return statement, let us include one more printf statement,"""
"""give space here, type printf opening bracket, closing bracket."""
"""Inside the bracket within the double quotes type Welcome backslash n ,  at the end type a semicolon."""
Now click on   save.
Let us compile  and execute come back to our terminal.
you can recall the previously entered commands by using up arrowkey.
That is what I did now.
We see that the second  statement  welcome is  not executed.
Let us write the 'Welcome' statement above the return statement.
Click on  Save.
Let us compile and execute.
We see that the second printf statement welcome has also been executed.
Now let us see the common errors which we can come across.  Come back to our program.
"""Suppose here I  will miss the dot in “stdio.h”, click on Save."""
Let us  compile and execute .
We see that there is a fatal error  at line no.2 in our talk.c file.
"""The compiler cannot find a header file with the name “stdioh”. Hence it is giving an error """"no such file or directory""""."""
And the compilation is terminated.
"""Let us  now fix the error come back to a  program. Reinsert the dot “.”, click on Save."""
"""Let us compile and  execute. Yes, it is working."""
I will show you another common error.
Let us switch back to the program.
"""Now, suppose here I will miss the semicolon  at the end of the line."""
Click on  Save. Let us compile and execute.
"""We see that there is  an error at line no.6 in our talk.c file. that """"expected ';' (semicolon) before 'printf'""""."""
"""As I said before, semicolon acts as a statement terminator."""
So it will search for it at the end of the line.5 and at the beginning of the  line.6.
This is line 6.
This is the last place where you can put the semicolon.
Recall that the compiler also gives the error message on line 6.
Let us try what happens if we put the semicolon here.
Let us Compile and execute.
Now come back to our program. Let us type the semicolon here at the end of this line
as it is a conventional practice to type  the semicolon at the end of the line.
Let us Compile and execute. Yes it is working.
Now let us go back to our slides.
As an Assignment

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Getting ready for Moodle installation.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the prerequisites for installing Moodle."""
We will also learn to check for packages on localhost and database setup.
"""Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30  and Firefox web browser."""
You can use any web browser of your choice.
"""To install Moodle 3.3 in your system, you should have a machine that supports:"""
"""Apache 2.x (or higher version), MariaDB 5.5.30 (or any higher version) and PHP 5.4.4 +(or any higher version)."""
"""If you have older versions of the above, ideally uninstall these before proceeding ahead."""
MariaDB is the fastest growing open source database.
It is an alternative for MySQL database.
"""Web server distributions give you  Apache, MariaDB and PHP bundled in one."""
"""You can either install these separately or using a web server distribution like XAMPP, WAMPP or LAMPP."""
I have already installed XAMPP in my machine.
"""First of all, we should check if XAMPP is running on our machine."""
"""In the web browser, type: http colon double slash 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1  and press Enter."""
It shows a message Unable to connect.
"""This means, XAMPP service is not running."""
"""So, we have to start the XAMPP service."""
Let’s open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T keys together.
Start XAMPP by typing sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash lampp space start.
Enter the administrative password when prompted and press Enter.
If you get a message that says- Starting XAMPP for Linux …. XAMPP: Starting Apache...ok. XAMPP: Starting MySQL...ok. XAMPP: Starting ProFTPD...ok.
It means that XAMPP is installed in your system and you have started the service.
Please note XAMPP 5.6.30 uses MariaDB instead of MySQL.
The commands and tools are the same for both.
Let us go back to the browser and refresh the page.
We can now see the XAMPP screen.
You may get a message saying Command not found in the terminal.
This means XAMPP is not installed in your machine.
"""If so, refer to the XAMPP Installation tutorial in the PHP and MySQL  series on this website."""
Follow the instructions specified in the above tutorial and install the latest version of XAMPP.
Let’s switch back to the terminal.
Now follow the steps shown above to start XAMPP service.
Let us check the version of PHP on our system now.
On the terminal type: sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash bin slash php space hyphen v and press Enter.
"""Enter the administrative password, if prompted, and press Enter."""
My version of PHP is 5.6.30.
This message indicates that PHP  is installed successfully.
"""If you get a version lesser than 5.4.4, you should install the latest version of XAMPP."""
"""Next, let us check the version of MariaDB on our system."""
"""On the terminal, type: sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash bin slash mysql space hyphen v and press Enter."""
"""Enter the administrative password, if prompted, and press Enter."""
My version of MariaDB is 10.1.21
"""If you get a version lesser than 5.5.30, you should install the latest version of XAMPP."""
Please note. You should have XAMPP running to check the versions of PHP and database.
Also note that the command prompt has now changed.
Type backslash q and press Enter  to exit MariaDB.
You may also get other errors as shown here.
You may get a message that says “An apache daemon is already running”.
It means the startup script did not start XAMPP-Apache.
This indicates that there is another Apache instance already running.
"""To start XAMPP properly, you will have to first stop this daemon."""
The command to stop Apache is: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 space stop
You may get a message that says MySQL daemon failed to start.
This means the startup script did not start MySQL.
This indicates that there is another database instance already running.
"""To start XAMPP properly, first you have to stop this daemon."""
This command will stop MySQL: sudo space /etc/init.d/mysql space stop
Resolve all the errors and get XAMPP running successfully.
Then switch to your web browser and refresh the page.
"""If prompted for language selection, select English."""
We will now need to add a user and create a database for Moodle.
We will do this in phpmyadmin which is the graphical user interface for MariaDB.
It comes along with the XAMPP installation.
Let us go back to the browser.
"""On the XAMPP page, in the menu at the top, click on phpMyadmin."""
Click on User Accounts in the top menu and then click on Add User Account.
"""In the new window that opens, enter a username of your choice."""
I will type: moodle hyphen st as my username.
"""From the Host drop-down list, select Local."""
Enter a password of your choice in the Password text-box.
I will type: moodle hyphen st as my password.
Type the same password in the Re-type textbox.
Keep the Authentication Plugin option as it is.
Please do not click on Generate Password prompt for now.
"""Under Database for user account, we can see the option-"""
Create database with same name and grant all privileges.
We will check that option and click the Go button at the bottom right of this page.
We can see a message “You have added a new user” at the top of the window.
It means a new database with the name moodle-st and with a user moodle-st has been created.
"""Make a note of the username, password and database names."""
These will be required later to complete the Moodle installation.
Please note: Database name and username need not be the same.
"""To have different names, create the database first and then create a user for that database."""
"""Also, as per naming convention, username should not have any spaces in between."""
We now have XAMPP running and our database is ready.
We are now ready to install Moodle.
We will continue with the installation of Moodle in the next tutorial.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt:"""
"""about the prerequisites for installing Moodle,"""
"""how to check for the prerequisites, how to setup the database and how to add a user."""
"""The video at the following link, summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project."""

"""Spoken Tutorial project is funded by  MHRD, Government of India."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Array Operations in java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to:"""
import the class Arrays  and
perform basic operations on arrays.
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of arrays in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. [1]"""
The methods for array operations are available in a class called Arrays.
"""To access them, we need to import that class."""
It is done by the statement import java.util.Arrays semicolon.
We can access a method from the class.
We do it by adding a 'dot' and the method name.
"""So, Arrays dot toString means toString method from the  Arrays class."""
Now switch to eclipse.
We have already created a class ArraysDemo.
Let us now import the class Arrays.
The import statement is written before the class definition.
"""So, before public class, type:"""
import java.util.Arrays semicolon
This statement says that java contains a package called util which contains the class Arrays and it has to be imported.
"""Now, let us add an array."""
"""Inside the main function, type:"""
"""int marks open and close square brackets equal to within curly brackets 2, 7, 5, 4, 8"""
Now we shall use a method available in the Arrays class to get a string representation of the array and print it.
"""So, type: String mStr equal to  Arrays dot toString  parentheses  inside parentheses  will give the array name i.e. marks."""
"""Now, this toString method will give the string representation of the array."""
We shall print the marks.
"""So, type System  dot out dot  println inside parentheses type mStr;"""
"""Now, let us look at the output. So save and run the program."""
"""As we can see in the output, the toString method has given a string representation of the array."""
"""Now, let us look at sorting the elements of the array."""
"""So, before the line Arrays dot toString type: Arrays dot  sort within parentheses the Array name i.e marks."""
"""So, the sort method in the Arrays class sorts the elements of the array passed to it."""
Now we are sorting the elements of the array marks and then printing the string form of it.
Let us look at the output. So save and run.
"""As we can see in the output, the sort method has sorted the array in the ascending order."""
Note that the sort method has changed the array itself.
This type of sorting is called inplace sorting.
It means that the array which contains the elements is changed as a result of sorting.
The next method we are going to look at is fill.
The fill method takes two arguments.
Remove the sorting line and
type: Arrays dot fill within brackets the name of the array i.e marks;
"""This is our first argument and second is the value that should be filled in the array, we will give it 6 and semicolon. Save and Run."""
"""As we can see, as the name goes, the fill method fills the array with the given argument i.e 6."""
The next method we are going to look at is copyOf.
We are going to copy all the elements of the array marks into the array marksCopy.
"""So, remove 'arrays dot fill'."""
And type: int marksCopy[];
"""Next line, type: marksCopy = Arrays.copyOf(marks, 5);"""
This method takes two arguments.
The first argument is the name of the  array from which you want to copy the elements.i.e marks.
"""The second is the no.of elements to copy, over here we will copy 5."""
"""Then, in arrays dot toString, change marks to marksCopy."""
Now save and run the program.
We see that the elements of the array marks have been copied to the array marksCopy.
Let us see what happens if we change the no.of elements to be copied.
Let's Change 5 to 3.
Save and Run.
"""As we can see, only the first three elements have been copied."""
Let us see what happens if the no.of elements to be copied is greater than the total no.of elements in the array.
"""So, change 3 to 8."""
Save and Run the program.
"""As we can see, the extra elements have been set to the default value  which is 0."""
"""Next, we'll see how to copy a range of values."""
"""So, change copyOf to copyOfRange and 8 to 1, 4."""
This method copies all the elements starting from  the index 1 and stopping at index 3.
Save and Run.
"""As we can see, the elements from index 1 to  3 have been copied."""
"""Note that we have given 1, 4  as our arguments."""
"""But, even then the element at index 4 has not been copied."""
Only the elements till index 3 have been copied. It stops one index before the given range.
"""So, this behavior ensures that continuity of ranges is maintained."""
"""(0, 4) implies from index 0 to 3."""
"""(4, 6) will imply index from 4 to 5."""
"""So it behaves as if (0, 4) + (4, 6) = (0, 5)."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
How to import the class Arrays.
"""Perform array operations like  toStrings, sort, copy, fill."""
For assignment:
Read about the Arrays.equals method and find out what it does.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Introduction to Tux Typing.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn about  Tux Typing and the Tux typing interface."""
"You will learn how to type accurately, quickly and efficiently on a computer keyboard that has English alphabet keys."""
You will also learn to type without having to look down at the keyboard every time you type.
What is Tux Typing?
Tux Typing is a typing tutor.
It teaches you how to type using interactive games and gradually introduces you to typing different characters.
You can learn typing at your own pace
and gradually increase your typing speed and along with it your accuracy.
Tux typing also enables you to  enter new words for practice and set the language for typing.
"""Here, we are using Tux Typing 1.8.0 on Ubuntu Linux 11.10."""
You can install Tux Typing using the Ubuntu Software Centre.
"""For more information on Ubuntu Software Centre, please refer to the Ubuntu Linux Tutorials on this website."""
Let’s open Tux Typing.
"""First, click Dash Home which is the round button, on the top left corner of your computer desktop."""
"""The Search box appears. In the Search box, next to Dash Home, type """"Tux Typing""""."""
The Tux Typing icon appears beneath the Search box.
Click the 'Tux Typing' icon.
The Tux Typing window appears.
The Tux Typing comprises the following menus:
Fish Cascade – a gaming zone Comet Zap – another gaming zone
Lessons – comprises different lessons that will teach us to learn characters.
"""Options – Comprises menus that help us to edit words, learn to type phrases, get information on the tux typing project and set up the language."""
Quit – click to quit the game.
Let us practice to type using the Lessons.
"""In the Main menu, click Lessons."""
The window comprising the lesson appears.
Let us start by learning the first lesson.
"""Click """"basic_lesson_01.xml""""."""
The window comprising the instructions appears. Read the instructions.
"""To start the lesson, let us press the space-bar."""
"""The window displaying the keyboard, appears."""
We will now start learning to type the letter 'a'.
Press 'p' to start practicing.
"""A window that displays the characters to type, appears."""
What does this line displaying ‘aaa aaa…..’ mean?
You are required to type these letters.
"""Let us name this line as """"Teacher’s line""""."""
We now see the English keyboard which is the standard keyboard used by most of us.
Do you see the red square around 'A'? It indicates that it is the character that you have to type now.
"""The first line of the keyboard displays numerals, special characters and the backspace key."""
You press the backspace key to delete typed characters.
"""The keyboard also has three rows of alphabets, numerals and other characters."""
"""The second line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, few special characters and the Enter key."""
You can press the Enter key to go to the next line.
"""The third line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, colon/semicolon and Caps Lock key."""
Use  the Caps Lock key to type capital letters.
"""The fourth line of the keyboard comprises alphabets, special characters and shift keys."""
Press the shift key together with any other alphabet key to type capital letters.
Press the Shift key with any other key to type a character given at the top of the key.
"""For example, the key with the numeral 1 has the exclamation mark on top."""
"""To type the exclamation mark, press the Shift key together with 1."""
"""The fifth line of the keyboard comprises the Ctrl, Alt and Function keys. It also contains the space bar."""
"""Now, let us see if there are differences between the Tux Typing keyboard, laptop keyboard and desktop keyboard."""
Notice that the Tux Typing keyboard and the keyboards used in desktops and laptops are similar.
"""Now, let’s see the correct placement of our fingers on the keyboard."""
Look at this slide.
"""It displays the fingers and their names. Fingers, from left to right, are named:"""
"Little finger,Ring finger Middle finger,Index finger and Thumb."
On your keyboard place your left hand on the left side of the keyboard.
"""Ensure that the Little finger is on the alphabet 'A',"""
"""Ring finger is on the alphabet 'S',"""
"""Middle finger on the alphabet 'D',"""
Index finger on the alphabet 'F'.
"""Now, place your right hand on the right side of the keyboard."""
"""Ensure that the Little finger is on the colon/semi-colon keystroke,"""
Ring finger on the alphabet 'L'
"""Middle finger on the alphabet 'K',"""
Index finger on the alphabet 'J'.
Use your right thumb to press the space-bar.
The two hand images will guide you to use the right finger to type the character.
Wondering what the red circle of the left-hand little finger is?
Your guess is right. You need to use that finger to type 'a'.
Place your fingers on the keyboard as indicated earlier in the lesson.
"""Now, let us start typing."""
"""As we type, the characters are displayed in the line below the Teacher’s line."""
Let us name this the Student’s line.
"""Now, let’s type a character that is not displayed in the teacher’s line."""
Do you see that mistyped character displayed in the student’s line? It is not displayed.
"""Instead, an 'X' mark briefly appears on the mistyped character on the keyboard."""
Let’s type a few more letters.
"""Now, let us collect the metrics of our typing."""
"""By now, you would have guessed what the fields on the left hand side indicate."""
Time – specifies the speed of your typing.
Chars – indicates the number of characters typed by you.
CPM - indicates the characters per minutes typed by you.
WPM – specifies the number of words typed by you.
Errors – indicates the number of errors typed by you.
Accuracy – indicates the accuracy of your typing.
Press the Escape key twice to go back to the main menu.
We have learnt our first typing lesson!
It is a good practice to first learn to type accurately at lower speeds.
"""Once we learn to type accurately, without mistakes, we can increase the typing speed."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Tux Typing.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about the Tux Typing interface and completed our first typing lesson."""
"""Switch to """"basic_lesson_02.xml""""."""
Practice with this level.
Complete typing all the characters in this level and press the Enter key.
"""Similarly, you can practice different lessons."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create and edit shapes using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will familiarize ourselves with Inkscape."""
We will learn about Inkscape interface and how to: Create basic shapes
Fill color and  Modify shapes using handles.
"""For this tutorial, I am using:  Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.48.4"
Go to Dash home and type: Inkscape.
You can open Inkscape by double-clicking on the logo.
"""On the top of the interface, you will find the menu bar and Tool controls bar."""
This is followed by the rulers at the top and at the side.
"""On the right side of the interface, you will find the Command bar and Snap controls bar."""
The Tool box is located on the left side of the interface.
"""In the centre, is the canvas. This is where you will draw your graphics."""
"""At the bottom of the interface, we can see the color palette and the status bar."""
"""Now, let us learn to create and edit some basic shapes in Inkscape."""
"""First of all, we will learn about Select and Transform tool. It is commonly called as Selector tool."""
It's a very important tool. You will find it on the left hand side of the Tool box.
"""With this tool, you can select objects, transform and move them around on the canvas."""
"""To open a new Inkscape document, click on File and then choose New and click on Default."""
"""To open an existing Inkscape document, click on File and then choose Open."""
Let's open the drawing_1.svg file that we created earlier.
I had saved it in Documents folder. Click on Open button at the bottom right.
We created a rectangle earlier.
"""Now, click on the rectangle."""
"""By default, the color of the rectangle is green."""
"""To change the color to red, we will use the color palette at the bottom."""
"""So, I will move the cursor to the bottom and click on red color."""
Observe the color change in the rectangle.
"""Let us now move the rectangle.To do so, you should click anywhere on the rectangle."""
"""Now, without releasing the mouse button, drag it wherever you want on the canvas."""
Then release the mouse-button.
"""Let us zoom in for a better view. To do so, press Ctrl key and use the scroll button on the mouse."""
Notice arrows around the rectangle. These are called handles which we can use for scaling and rotating.
"""When the cursor is kept on any of the handles, the color of the handle changes."""
This indicates that particular handle is selected and ready for resizing.
"""To scale or resize the rectangle, click and drag on any one of the corner handles."""
"""If you want to keep the aspect ratio same, hold the Ctrl key while resizing."""
"""To change the length or the width of the rectangle, use one of the handles on the sides of the rectangle."""
"""Click and drag the handle, either to the left or to the right."""
Observe the change in the width of the rectangle.
"""Now, let's change the height of the rectangle."""
"""So, we will click and drag on either the top or the bottom handle."""
Observe the change in the height of the rectangle.
We can also change the width and height of the rectangle manually by changing the Width and Height parameters on the Tool controls bar.
I will change the Width to 400 and Height to 200.
Notice the change in the size of the rectangle.
"""In a similar way, you can also move the object by changing the X and Y axes positions."""
"""Now, let's learn how to rotate the rectangle."""
"""To do so, click on the rectangle once again."""
Notice that now the shape of the corner handles has changed to indicate that it is ready for rotation.
I will click on the top right corner handle and rotate the rectangle.
You can also skew the rectangle by clicking and dragging any of the side handles.
I am clicking the left middle handle and dragging it up and down to skew the rectangle.
Observe the changes as I do so.
We will learn some more details on using these handles in another tutorial.
Let us unselect this shape now.
"""To do so, click anywhere in the canvas area or outside the canvas boundary."""
Let me move the mouse back to the Tool box and over the same rectangle tool.
The tool tip says that we can draw rectangles and squares using this tool.
"""So, first let me click on this tool."""
"""To draw a square, simply hold the Ctrl key and drag on the Canvas."""
Let me change its color to pink.
An assignment for you.
Select the Create circles and ellipses tool from the Tool box.
"""Use the Ctrl key, draw a circle on the canvas."""
Color it blue.
This is my circle.
Now let us learn how to modify this circle.
You can change the Start and the End parameters to alter the shape of the circle to an arc or a segment.
There are 3 options here on the Tool controls bar which help to switch between the shapes.
Let me change the Start parameter to 100 and End parameter to  -50.
We see that the circle shape has now changed to a segment shape.
Now I will click on Arc icon and we see the change in the shape.
We can change back to circle shape again by clicking on the Circle icon.
"""Now, let's take a closer look at the circle shape on our canvas."""
"""Notice 2 resize handles and 2 circular handles called arc handles, on the shape."""
The 2 resize handles can be used to alter the shape of the circle to an ellipse shape.
Just drag these handles in the up-down or left-right directions.
Observe the changes in the shape.
The 2 arc handles overlap each other. Click on the arc handle and move it anti-clockwise.
We can now see both the arc handles.
We can modify the circle shape into arc or segment shape using these arc handles.
Just by moving them in clockwise or anti-clockwise directions and observe the change in the shape.
"""Now, we will click on the rectangle tool in the Tool box and then click on the square."""
Notice 2 resize handles and 2 arc handles on the top right corner of the shape.
"""As before, the 2 arc handles overlap each other."""
Click on one of the arc handle and move it clockwise.
"""Now, we can see both the arc handles."""
We can give rounded edges to the square using these handles.
Move them in clockwise or anti-clockwise directions and observe the change in the shape.
"""Now, let us create a polygon by clicking on the Stars and polygons tool from the Tool box."""
"""This is right below the circle tool. So, click on it."""
We will draw a polygon in a similar way and change the color to green.
"""By default, a 5-sided polygon i.e. a pentagon is drawn."""
"""Look at the Tool controls bar. Here, it says the number of corners of the polygon is 5."""
You can create a square by decreasing the number to 4 and a triangle by decreasing it to 3.
"""By increasing it, we can create a pentagon, hexagon and so on."""
Notice a resize handle on the polygon.
We can use it to resize or rotate the polygon.
"""Convert this shape into a star shape by clicking on the star icon next to the polygon icon, in the Tool controls bar."""
Notice 2 handles on the star shape – one at the tip and one at the joint.
Click and drag the handle at the tip of the star to resize or rotate it.
We can resize and skew the shape of the star using the other handle.
Click on it and move in clockwise or anti-clockwise directions and observe the change in the shape and size.
We have come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about Inkscape interface."""
"""We also learnt to-  Create basic shapes like rectangle, square, circle, ellipse, polygon and star."""
Fill color into the shapes and  modify the shapes using handles.

We have come to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installation of FrontAccounting on Linux Operating System.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to - Install XAMPP"""
Download FrontAccounting software
Do the database setup and Install FrontAccounting in Linux OS
"""To record this tutorial, I‘m using: Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04"""
"""Apache, MySQL and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.5.19"""
FrontAccounting 2.4.7
Firefox web browser and  A working Internet connection.
You can use any web browser of your choice.
FrontAccounting is a server based Accounting System.
So we will be using XAMPP to setup the web server on our machine.
"""Open a web browser. In the address bar, type this URL and press Enter."""
This will take us to the XAMPP download page.
Here XAMPP is available to download for all operating systems.
The latest version of XAMPP can be downloaded by clicking this green button.
"""However, depending upon your software requirement, you may need a different version of XAMPP."""
In my case I need XAMPP version 5.5.19
Scroll down and select XAMPP Linux.
The redirected page will display all the XAMPP versions till date.
"""For this installation, I will select the XAMPP version 5.5.19"""
"""My system is a 64bit Operating System. So I will download, xampp-linux-x64-5.5.19-0-installer.run"""
"""Now, click on the Save file button and then click on the OK button."""
"""In my machine, it has been saved in the Downloads folder."""
Let’s open a terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T keys together.
"""On the terminal, type the command cd space Downloads and press Enter."""
This will change the current working directory to Downloads.
Then type the command as shown and press Enter.
"""Now to run the installer file, type the command as shown and press Enter. Enter the admin password if prompted."""
Now the Setup wizard dialog box opens.
Click on the Next button whenever prompted and follow the installation steps as shown.
Uncheck Learn more about Bitnami for XAMPP check box. Then continue by clicking on the Next button.
"""Once the installation done, uncheck Launch XAMPP check box."""
"""Lastly, click on Finish button."""
Now we should check whether XAMPP is successfully installed on our machine or not.
"""In the terminal, start XAMPP service by typing sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash lampp space start"""
Type the admin password when prompted and press Enter.
You may get a message as shown here. This indicates that XAMPP is installed on your system and you have started the service.
"""In case you get a message saying, Command not found, then XAMPP is not installed on your machine."""
You may get some error messages like: “Apache shutdown unexpectedly”  or
“Port 80 in use for Apache Server” or
“Unable to connect to any of the specified MySQL hosts for MySQL database.”
This is because the default ports allotted to Apache and MySQL is taken by another software.
Default port number for Apache is 80 and for MySQL is 3306.
"""To change these ports, refer to the Additional Reading Material of this tutorial."""
And allot the proper port numbers before proceeding further. For eg: 8080
"""Now, open Firefox web browser. In the address bar, type localhost and press Enter."""
We should be able to see the XAMPP screen.
"""If prompted for language selection, select English."""
We are now in the XAMPP homepage.
"""In the menu at the left of the screen, click on PHPinfo."""
Now press Ctrl + F keys and search for DOCUMENT underscore ROOT.
It will be found in the table Apache Environment.
The value of DOCUMENT underscore ROOT will be either slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs or  slash var slash www
"""In my machine, it is slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs."""
Please make a note of this path. We are going to install FrontAccounting here.
Let's start downloading Front Accounting.
Open another tab in the web browser and go to this URL.
Click on frontaccounting-2.4.7.tar.gz
"""Immediately, the download begins. Click on the Save File button and then click on the OK button."""
Switch back to the terminal.
"""Next, we have to extract the contents of the tar.gz file that we downloaded."""
"""So, type sudo space tar space hyphen zxvf space frontaccounting hyphen 2.4.7.tar.gz"""
Type the admin password if prompted and press Enter.
"""Once extracted, I will rename the extracted FrontAccounting folder as account."""
Type the command- mv space frontaccounting space account and press Enter.
"""Renaming of the folder name is optional, however, It helps to identify multiple instances of FrontAccounting installed on a single machine."""
Switch Back to the terminal.
Now we have to move the folder account into apache home directory.
"""To move account folder to apache home directory, type sudo space mv space account space /opt/lampp/htdocs/  and press Enter."""
"""Now, let’s go to the apache home directory."""
"""To do that, type cd space /opt/lampp/htdocs/  and press Enter."""
"""To change account folder permission, type sudo space chmod space -R space 777 space account slash  and press Enter."""
We have successfully installed the XAMPP server.
Make sure that the FrontAccounting installer is in the web server’s root directory.
Next we need to create a database for FrontAccounting to proceed further.
"""We will do this in phpmyadmin, which is the graphical user interface for MySQL It comes along with the XAMPP installation"""
"""Let us go back to the XAMPP Page in the browser. On the XAMPP page, in the menu at the left, click on phpMyadmin."""
Click on Users in the top menu and then click on Add User.
In the new window that opens enter a username of your choice. I will type frontacc as my username.
"""From the Host drop-down list, select Local."""
Enter a password of your choice in the Password text-box.
I will type admin123 as my password.
Type the same password in the Re-type textbox.
Do not click on Generate Password prompt for now.
"""Under Database for user, we can see the option Create database with the same name and grant all privileges."""
We will check that option and scroll down.
Then click the Go button at the bottom right of the page.
We see a message “You have added a new user”. It means a new database with the name frontacc and with a user frontacc has been created.
This username and password is only for Database login purpose.
"""Make a note of the username, password and database names."""
These will be required later to complete the FrontAccounting installation.
Please note:  Database name and username need not be the same.
"""To have different names, create the database first and then create a user for that database."""
"""Also, as per naming convention, username should not have any spaces in between."""
We now have XAMPP running and our database is ready.
We are now ready to proceed installing Front Accounting.
In the web browser open a new tab. In the address bar type localhost/account and press Enter.
We can see the FrontAccounting webpage showing Step 1: System Diagnostics
Make sure that Select install wizard language is English.
Scroll down and click on Continue button at the bottom of the page.
The title of the next web page is Step 2: Database Server Settings.
"""Here, I’ll keep the server port as empty."""
"""If you have changed the MySQL default port number other than 3306, then enter that port number here."""
Enter the following details which we have created earlier- database Name as frontacc database user as frontacc
database password as admin123
Ignore the rest of options and click on Continue button at the bottom.
"""Next, you will need to put the details of your own company. I will demonstrate how to do so."""
"""In Company Name field, I will type ST Company Pvt Ltd."""
I will keep the Admin Login as admin.
Then I will type the Admin password as spoken. You can give any password of your choice.
Re-enter the same password. Remember this is the login password.
Next we see two options for the Charts of Accounts.
I will select Standard new company American COA.
Select the Default Language as English.
Click on the Install button.
"""We can see the final message on our screen, FrontAccounting ERP has been installed successfully. Which confirms that our installation is successful."""
"""Click on the link, Click here to start to log-in to the FrontAccounting interface."""
"""In the log-in screen, enter the following details: User name as admin Password as spoken"""
Company as ST Company Pvt. Ltd. And click on the Login button.
We are brought to the Front Accounting Administration page. We can see various tabs on this page.
We will learn how to use many of these later in this series.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to -   Download and install XAMPP"""
Download and install FrontAccounting software
And Do the database setup in Linux OS
"""The Spoken Tutorial Project team conducts workshops and gives certificates. For more details, please write to us."""
Do you have questions in THIS Spoken Tutorial? Please visit this site.
Choose the minute and second where you have the question Explain your question briefly
Someone from our team will answer them
The Spoken Tutorial forum is for specific questions on this tutorial Please do not post unrelated and general questions on them
"""This will help reduce the clutter With less clutter, we can use these discussion as instructional material"""
"""Spoken Tutorial Project is funded by MHRD, Government of India."""
The script has been contributed by Spoken Tutorial team.
Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Simple Filters with Linux.
"""Here we will be learning about head, Tail, sort, cut and paste."""
All these are command line text manipulation tools.
"""If you see a hash (#) symbol on the Terminal, you need to become root to execute those commands."""
"""sudo su or su root. If you see a dollar symbol on the Terminal, you can be an ordinary user to execute those commands."""
I assume that you did a default installation and did not modify any path where the files are getting saved.
I am using Linux for this tutorial.
"""Prerequisites for this module are- the ability to use the mouse, keyboard, maximize and minimize buttons on a window."""
"""We use the Head command followed by an ascii file name to display the first 10 lines of a file, by default."""
Let us create a file.
Go to Applications > Accessories > Text Editor.
I already have these numbers in another file for the sake of time constraint.
Let me copy and paste.
"""Hit on File, Save."""
Name the file as numbers dot txt and hit on Save.
Close this file.
"""Now, go to Applications > Accessories > Terminal."""
Let us try to see if we can see the file we created.
Type ls and hit on Enter.
What we did here is to list all the folders and files on our home directory.
Now we can use the cat command to read the contents of the file we created.
Cat n-u-m. Hit on tab to auto-fill the file name. Hit on Enter.
Let us do the same with the head command.
head numbers dot txt Enter.
Now the first 10 lines are displayed.
"""If we want to see the first 5 lines, use the option  hyphen n5 in between the head command and the file name."""
"""Hit on Up-arrow,  hyphen n5 and Enter."""
"""Now, the first 5 lines alone are displayed."""
Let us switch back to the presentation.
"""The tail command works exactly opposite to the head command, it displays the last 10 lines of a file, by default."""
I am hitting on ALT and Tab to switch to the terminal.
tail numbers dot txt
"""If we want to see just the last 5 lines, use the option hyphen n5 in between the tail command and the file name."""
"""hyphen n5, Enter."""
Switch to slides.
A log file contains events which took place in a system.
Auth dot log file maintains log's for who logged in & who logged out.
The most useful option of the tail command is to use hyphen f option to follow the tail of a log file.
"""If a new line is appended to the log file, the tail command will take that as the last line and display 10 lines, by default, above it."""
Go to the terminal.
tail hyphen f forward slash var slash log slash auth dot log.
Let me resize this terminal.
"""Let us open another Terminal, Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal."""
Let me resize this terminal
so that I can show you in a single screen how tail follows the last line in a log file.
"""Try to su as yourself, hit on Enter."""
Give in some wrong password and hit on Enter.
You will see that the terminal on which tail is running is appended with a new log.
The date & time specify when the authentication failure took place.
"""Type: date, hit on Enter to verify the system date and time."""
Type Exit to close this terminal.
Hit CTRL C to close the running tail command & maximize the screen.
We have seen only auth dot log file in the previous example.
These are the commonly used log files in Linux.
A Linux system administrator will look into these log files for more information to troubleshoot his machine if there is a problem.
"""""""Sort"""" command, as the name suggests, will sort a file for us in both ascending and descending order."""
sort numbers dot txt. This would sort our numbers dot txt file in ascending order.
"""Notice something is strange in there, sort just looks at the first character to sort, so 10, 11 & 12 appear before the number 2."""
"""To avoid this, add the option of -n hyphen n and  Enter."""
"""Now, sort looks at the entire number to sort them."""
"""To sort numbers dot txt in reverse order, add an option of hyphen r."""
"""We have numbers that repeat in this file. To pull out just the unique numbers, add another option of hyphen u."""
Go to Terminal.
Up-Arrow.
"""U,  Enter."""
"""Previously, two 2's were displayed. Now only one 2 is displayed."""
"""Now, we will see how we can sort a file based on certain column."""
Let us create a file and key in these as shown below.
Go to Applications > Accessories > Text Editor.
"""I already have the data in another file for the sake of time constraint. Let me copy & Paste the value, CTRL+C; CTRL+V."""
"""File, Save it as marks dot txt, Hit on Save."""
Don't mind the special characters on this file. I don't want someone to sue me for giving them low marks.
Close this file.
Let us sort based on the second column of marks dot txt file.
sort space marks dot txt space hyphen t space open inverted commas space close inverted commas space.
"""Here, hyphen t stands for the delimiter & the space in between the quotes represents it."""
hyphen k2 for the second column on which sort should be performed.
Hit on Enter.
Cat marks dot txt.
"""This is the original file, if you see Avir is moved above and Bala came below when we sorted based on the second column alone."""
Cut command is used to cut just certain information from a file.
Let us pull out the names from marks dot txt.
Let us go to the terminal ALT Tab.
cut space marks dot txt space hyphen d space open inverted commas  space close inverted commas space.
"""Here in cut command, 'd' is the delimiter & the space in between the quotes represents the delimiter."""
hyphen f2 for the second column. Hit on Enter.
Paste command will merge corresponding subsequent lines of the files.
"""Let us use both,  numbers dot txt and marks dot txt files now."""
"""paste numbers dot txt  marks dot txt, Enter."""
"""Now, the first line of marks dot txt was appended to the first line of numbers dot txt."""
We can use the redirect key to redirect this output to some other file called concatefile dot txt.
Hit on Up-arrow. Hit on the redirect key which is the Greater-than symbol. concatfile dot txt. Hit on Enter.
Cat concatfile dot txt.
Let us go to the slide.
"""If we want paste to print out the numbers serially, delimited with tab, we can use the hyphen s option."""
paste  hyphen s
numbers dot txt

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on conversion of Excel data to Marc 21 format.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to convert Excel data to Marc 21 format on a 64-bit Windows machine."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Windows 10 Pro and Firefox web browser."""
"""To follow this tutorial, learners should be familiar with Library Science."""
"""Before moving ahead, please ensure that you have the following on your machine- Windows 10, 8 or 7,"""
"""Any web browser. For eg: Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome."""
"""Earlier in the same series, we had installed MarcEdit 7 on the Desktop."""
Open the same MarcEdit 7 by double-clicking on the icon.
A window named MarcEdit 7.0.250 By Terry Reese opens.
Locate and click on the tab Export Tab Delimited Text.
"""Under the Source File field, locate the icon for a folder."""
The source file is an Excel file which we are converting into .mrk format.
Click on this icon for the Folder and browse for the Excel file in the field for File name.
Click on the drop-down adjacent to File name.
If you have Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP/2003 (.xls) then choose the format Excel File(*.xls).
"""And if you have, Microsoft Excel 2007/2010/2013 XML(.xlsx) then choose the format Excel File(*.xlsx)."""
"""As I have the .(dot)xlsx  file, I will select Excel XML File(*.xlsx)."""
"""Next, go to the left-side folders and select the folder where your Excel file is saved."""
I have selected Downloads because that’s where I saved my Excel file.
"""So, from the Downloads folder, I have selected TestData.xlsx."""
"""When the file TestData.xlsx is selected, it appears in the File name field."""
"""Now, click on the Open button at the bottom of the window."""
The same window re-opens with the Source File as  C:\Users\spoken\Downloads\TestData.xlsx.
"""Now, click on the folder icon adjacent to the Output File."""
"""On doing so, Save File window opens prompting us to fill in the File name."""
"""On the same window, I will click on the Downloads folder located at the left hand side. And, type the File name: as TestData."""
Now click on Save button at the bottom of the page.
The same window appears again. The Output file field shows: C:\Users\spoken\Downloads\TestData.mrk.
"""Note that Excel Sheet Name: Sheet1 gets selected automatically by MarcEdit 7. However, this sheet name is editable."""
"""Under the Section Options, the check-box UTF-8 Encoded is selected by MarcEdit 7, by default."""
Click on the Next button at the right side of the same window.
"""Again a new window, MarcEdit Delimited Text Translator opens. The heading says Data Snapshot."""
This window will have all the field details as per entries made in the Excel file.
We will see the Fields ranging from 0 to 8 and above with their corresponding values.
"""For example, Field 0 has a value of 978-3-319-47238-6 (ISBN) on my machine."""
You may see a different value as per your Excel sheet.
"""Under the section DataSnapshot, locate the section Settings."""
Go to the tab Select and from the drop-down select Field 0.
With this we will be doing the mapping of Excel data with Koha MARC Tags.
"""Remember, you can customize Map To: and Indicators."""
"""However, it is important that the Fields and Subfield Codes are as per the Koha MARC Tag."""
"""For more information on MARC Tags, visit the link of official Library of Congress site."""
"""On the browser, type this URL and click on search."""
Recall that Map To: values entered in the field are referred from an earlier tutorial in this series.
I will enter 020$a in the Map To: field.
This sequence will change as per your Excel data.
I will leave Indicators: and Term. Punctuation: as they are.
"""However, you may fill these fields as directed by the Koha MARC Tags."""
Next is the check-box for Constant Data.
"""Click this if you wish to map the same information  into the data field for each entry, in the delimited text document."""
Click Repeatable subfield if you want to repeat the same subfield.
"""Next, click on the button Add Argument."""
"""On doing so, the value 0 020$a 0 appears in the field under the section Arguments."""
"""Similarly, let’s map all the other fields."""
"""Under the section Settings, go to Select. From the drop- down, select Field 1."""
"""In the field for Map To, type:  080$a."""
"""Now, click on the button Add Argument."""
"""On doing so, the value 1 080$a 0 appears in the field under the section Arguments."""
"""Under the tab Select, from the drop-down, select Field 2."""
"""In the field for Map To, type: 100$a."""
"""In the field for Indicators, type 1."""
Note that 1 is the first indicator of tag 100 and it represents the Surname for the subfield ‘a’.
"""Likewise, complete the mapping of all the fields up to Field 13 as being shown in the drop-down under Select."""
Notice the up and down arrows adjacent to each field.
You may use these to change the sequence of the values that appear.
"""Under the section Arguments, the Tags that are common with different sub-fields need to be joined."""
"""For that, do the following- Select common tags for example 245$a and 245$c."""
Then right-click on common tags and from drop-down select Join Items.
This will create a grouping of the fields that are with the same type.
Note that the * (asterisk symbol) will appear before the selected Tags.
The * asterisk symbol indicates that the common tags are now joined.
"""Alternately, you can do the mapping of fields by clicking on the tab Auto Generate to import the values of respective fields from 0 to 13, in the fields provided for Arguments."""
"""However, I have done mapping manually. So, I will not click Auto Generate option."""
Next we see four options.
First one is Save Template.
Use this if you want to save the same mapping for future use.
The saved template will be used if in case you face any problem with data conversion.
"""If we choose the option Save Template, then we will be prompted to give it a name and  specify the directory for saving it."""
It will get saved as .mrd file
Access this template in the future by clicking “Load Template” at the right side of the window.
Second option is Sort Fields.
Third option is Calculate common nonfiling data.
Fourth option is Ignore Header Row.
"""Click here, if you have a header in the Excel sheet and if you need to ignore the headings."""
"""Among these, Sort Fields and Calculate common nonfiling data are auto-selected by MarcEdit 7."""
I will leave them as they are.
"""Now, I will check the check-box for Save Template and Ignore Header Row."""
"""Next, locate and click on the tab Finish on the top right corner of the page."""
"""On doing so, Save File window opens, prompting us to fill in the File name."""
"""On the same window, I will click on the Downloads folder, located at the left hand side."""
"""And, in the field for File name, I will type TestData."""
"""Now, click on Save button at the bottom of the page."""
A pop-up window with the message: Process has been finished. Records saved to: C:\Users\Spoken\Download\TestData.mrk opens.
Click on the Ok button at the bottom of this dialog-box.
"""With this, .mrk file has been successfully saved in the directed location which is the Downloads folder."""
"""A new page MarcEdit 7.0.250 By Terry Reese, opens. Locate and click on the icon MarcEditor."""
"""A new page MarcEditor opens. On the main Menu, click on File and from the drop- down select Open."""
A window Open File opens showing TestData.mrk file.
Click and select the TestData.mrk file.
It will show in the field for File name.
Now click on Open at the bottom of the window.
Another window MarcEditor: TestData.mrk opens with all the details.
"""On the same window, from the main menu, click on the File."""
"""Now, from the drop-down select Compile File into MARC."""
Another new window Save File opens.
"""Here, locate File Name: and type the appropriate name in the field."""
I will type TestData.
"""Koha, by default, selects MARC Files (*.mrc) in the field Save as type:."""
"""Now, click on the Save button located at the bottom of the window."""
"""Upon doing so, on the same window at the bottom, you will see 5 records processed in 0.166228 seconds."""
This is because I imported only 5 records. You will see a different number of records and processed time as per your data.
"""With this, we have converted Excel data of our library into Marc 21 format successfully."""
Marc 21 format is the standard format used in Koha for cataloging and importing data into Koha.
"""Now, close this window. To do so, go to the top right corner and click on the Close button."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we have learnt to- convert Excel data to Marc 21 format on a 64-bit Windows machine."""
Assignment: Prepare a list of 10 records in Excel and convert those records into MARC by using MarcEdit 7.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on How to create a Library in Koha.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to: create a library and create a Group."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux Operating System 16.04"""
and  Koha version 16.05.
"""To follow this tutorial, learners should have knowledge of Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have Koha installed on your system."""
"""And, you should also have Admin access in Koha."""
"""For more details, please refer to the Koha Spoken Tutorial series on this website."""
Let us begin. I have already installed Koha on my system.
Let me switch to the Koha interface.
Log into Koha using the username and password given at the time of installation.
"""On my system, I had given Username as koha underscore library."""
"""Now, type the Password that was noted down from the conf.xml file."""
The Koha main page opens.
"""Note that while setting up Koha-,  We should add the details of every Branch library that we will create in Koha."""
This data is used in several areas of Koha later.
"""Now, let’s add a new library."""
Switch back to Koha interface.
Go to Home and click on Koha Administration.
Locate the section Basic parameters.
Click on Libraries and groups.
"""To add a new library, click on the tab '+ New Library'."""
"""We will skip the groups section, for now."""
"""In this page, note that all the fields marked in red are mandatory."""
"""Fill in the fields Library code and Name for your library, as I have done here."""
Some important things to note are-  there should be no space in the Library code
"""And, it should be less than 10 characters long."""
This code will be used as a unique identifier in the database.
"""The next section is where we have to fill our library’s contact details like- Address, phone number etc."""
I have filled the details as shown here.
"""If you don’t have information for any field listed here, then just leave it blank."""
"""Likewise, fill in your library’s details on this page."""
The address and phone details can be used to make custom notices for your library later.
These details can also be used by members when they want to contact the library.
"""The Email id field is not mandatory, as you can see."""
"""However, it is extremely important to have an email id for the library you create."""
This is the email id from where the notices to the members go to and come from.
Gmail id is preferable as it can be easily configured for sending mail and/or receiving mail.
"""Below the Email id field, we have the Reply-To and Return-Path fields."""
"""Reply-To- if you would like to specify another default email address for all replies to notices, you can do that here."""
I will add Reply-To email id as stlibreoffice@gmail.com.
"""If this is left blank, then all replies will go to the Email id given above."""
Coming to Return-Path-  this is the email address that all bounced messages will go to.
"""If this is left blank, then all bounced messages will go to the Email id given above."""
"""So, basically three different email ids can be used for"""
"""Email id ,"""
Reply-To and
Return-Path.
"""However, if only one email id is provided then by default, Koha will use it for all the three fields."""
"""Next, mention the URL of your library in the field, like I have done here."""
"""On filling the URL field, the particular library name will be linked in the holdings table on the OPAC."""
"""After this, we have to fill in the OPAC info."""
This is where you have to put information about your library.
I have entered some information about my library here.
"""This info will appear in the OPAC, when we move the cursor over the library name in the holdings table."""
If the URL for a particular branch library is put in this field  then OPAC will tell us the branch library where the book is available.
"""To get the hyper-link address information, hover the mouse on the link."""
This will give the address of the particular branch library where the book can be issued from.
Let’s switch back to the Koha interface.
Next we have the IP address.
If you want to restrict Koha admin access to a particular IP address then you can specify the IP here.
"""Else, you can leave it blank."""
I will leave it blank.
"""Lastly, we have the Notes field."""
This is where you can fill in any notes for future reference.
These will not be displayed in OPAC.
"""After entering all the details, click on the Submit button."""
The name of the newly added library appears on the Libraries page.
"""In our case, Spoken Tutorial Library."""
Let us now see when to use the Group Library option.
"""If you want to add a new group, click on the tab '+ New Group'."""
"""Suppose you have a few branch libraries for e.g.-  Chemistry Library, Physics Library and  Biology Library and you want to group them."""
In such a scenario use the Group Library option.
Name this group as Science library which falls under the main library.
Grouping can be done on the basis of similarities and/or similar characteristics etc.
Logout from your current session as a Database administrative user.
"""To do so, go to the top right corner and click on No Library Set."""
"""From the drop-down, click on Logout."""
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to- create a library and   create a new Group."""
As an assignment-  create a new library and  create a new group .

"""To follow this tutorial, learners should be familiar with Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial,  You should have Koha installed on your system. And, You should also have Admin access in Koha."""
"""If not, please refer to the Koha Spoken Tutorial series on this website."""
Importing records into Koha is done in two steps: Stage MARC records for import and  Manage staged records.
"""To begin, let’s login to Koha with our Superlibrarian access."""
"""On the Home page, click on Tools."""
"""A new page opens. Under the section Catalog, click on Stage MARC records for import."""
A new page opens with the title Stage MARC records for import.
Go to the section Stage records into the reservoir.
"""Here, click on Browse... adjacent to Select the file to stage."""
A window File Upload opens. Then go to the Downloads folder.
"""Here, locate the file named TestData.mrc."""
"""Recall, we had created TestData.mrc file in one of the earlier tutorial."""
"""Select the TestData.mrc file, if not already selected. And, click on the button Open at the bottom of the page."""
"""On the same page, you will see TestData.mrc as name of the file, adjacent to the tab Browse."""
"""Now, click on Upload file button at the bottom of the page."""
You will see the Upload progress bar in brown color.
"""After the upload is complete up to 100%, we are prompted to fill in some details."""
"""First, fill the field for Comments about this file."""
This is useful for identifying the uploaded file in KOHA.
I will enter Book Data.
"""Next is Record type.  Here, Koha by default, selects Bibliographic."""
"""Similarly, for Character encoding, Koha by default selects UTF-8 (Default)."""
"""Next, come to the section Look for existing records in catalog?"""
"""Under this section, go to Record matching rule:  Koha by default, selects Do not look for matching records."""
"""If you want to match existing records, select another option from the drop down i.e. ISBN/ISSN number."""
Now we come to Action if matching record found.
"""Koha by default, selects Replace existing record with incoming record."""
"""Then comes Action if no match is found. Koha by default, selects Add incoming record."""
"""Next, we come to the section Check for embedded item record data? There are two options here,  Yes and  No."""
"""Koha by default, selects Yes."""
"""For How to process items, Koha by default, selects Always add items."""
"""There are other options, as well. You may choose any of these options as per your preference."""
Click on the Stage for import button at the bottom of the page. You will see “Job progress” in a blue colored bar.
"""When the progress is complete up to 100%, a new page opens with the heading Stage MARC records for import."""
Note that now we have successfully imported the data which we had in our Excel sheet.
It has the following details.
Note that you will see a different value on your Koha interface as per your .mrc data.
"""On this same page, above the title, you will see two options: Stage MARC records and Manage staged records."""
Note that I will not click on Stage MARC records as I have already imported the Excel file i.e. TestData.
If you need to import any other file then click on Stage MARC records and follow the steps as mentioned earlier.
"""Next, we have to manage the imported records in KOHA Catalog. So, click on Manage staged records."""
A new window Manage staged MARC records › Batch 6 opens.
"""On this page, Koha fills the following fields with the values shown here."""
"""And for the following fields, Koha by default, selects these entries from the drop down."""
"""But, you can change these entries from their respective drop-downs as per your requirement."""
Next is the button named Apply different matching rules.
You may click on this button to avoid the duplication of the records in the database. I will skip this button and move ahead.
"""Now, locate Add new bibliographic records into this framework. And from the drop down, I will select BOOKS."""
"""Again, you may select as per your requirement."""
"""Now, I will click on the tab Import this batch into the catalog ."""
"""However, before clicking we will go through the section Citation."""
Please note the particular numbers. Note that you will see a different number with the details that we have imported from Excel.
"""Now, we will click on the button named Import this batch into the catalog."""
"""When we do so, the Job progress bar appears."""
"""When the progress is complete up to 100%, a new page opens"""
with the heading Manage staged MARC records › Batch 6 and the following details which were entered earlier.
"""It is possible to undo your import. In case, you found a mistake in the imported data, to correct it do the following."""
Click on the tab Undo import into catalog at the bottom of the section.
I will not click here.
Next is Completed import of records.
"""Here, you will see the details of the records added, updated and so on."""
Then you will see the section Citation with the details that have been imported.
"""Once the import is complete, a link to the new Record will appear."""
This is visible to the right side of each Citation that was imported.
"""Now, we will confirm whether the titles are added in the Catalog or not."""
"""To do so, at the top of the same page, locate the field for Search the catalog."""
I will now do a small test to confirm the imports of records into Koha.
"""So, I will type one of the titles from the imported record in the Citation section."""
"""Then, click on the Submit button at the right side of the field."""
"""A new page opens- Inorganic chemistry Housecroft, Catherine E."""
"""Koha shows the searched Title result, which proves that records are imported properly."""
"""With this, we have completed importing MARC into Koha."""
"""Let us Summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt to import a MARC file into KOHA and  search imported data in OPAC."""
For assignment- Use the 10 records of MARC that were converted in an earlier tutorial and import them into KOHA.
"""Hint: Please refer to the tutorial, Conversion of Excel data to Marc 21 format."""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Basics of Bezier tool using Inkscape.
Draw straight lines and closed shapes
Draw curved lines
"""Add, edit and delete nodes."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:"""
I will be recording this tutorial in maximum resolution mode.
This is to accommodate all the tools that will be demonstrated.
Let us open Inkscape.
First let us draw a straight line using Bezier tool.
The Bezier tool is right below the Pencil tool.
Let's click on it.
Observe the 4 options in the Tool controls bar at the top left.
There are 4 modes of drawing Bezier curve.
"""By default, the Create regular Bezier path option is enabled."""
Click once on the canvas and move the cursor to the other end.
Click once again. Notice that the line drawn is highlighted in green color.
"""Now, right-click to complete the line."""
The two end points of the line are called nodes. We will learn more about them a little later.
"""Next, let us draw a triangle."""
"""First, draw a slanted line. Click once and draw another line at an angle."""
Now click once more to draw a third line and join it with the starting node to complete the triangle.
"""Next, we will draw a curved line using Bezier tool."""
"""Click on the canvas to draw a straight line. Click again, hold and drag to form a curve."""
Right-click to complete the curve.
"""In a similar way, draw some more curve shapes on the canvas."""
Remember these steps- 1. Click and draw a straight line.
"""2. Click again, hold and drag to form a curve."""
3.  Then right-click to complete the curve.
Press Ctrl + A and clear the canvas before proceeding further.
"""Next, let us learn how to draw a closed curved path."""
First draw a curved line on the canvas.
Then we release the mouse and move the cursor away from the end node of the curved line.
We see a curved path in red color.
"""If you click once and move the cursor, we see a straight path in red color. To make it as a curve, click and drag."""
"""Again at the end node, the line curves as we move."""
"""Again click once; we see a straight path in red color. To make the straight line curved, click and drag."""
"""Again at the end node, the line curves as we move. Move the cursor and go back to the starting node and close the path."""
Go to Tool controls bar. Click on the second icon of the mode. This helps to create spiral paths and irregular shapes.
Draw some irregular curves and close the path.
Observe that it transforms into the closest spiral shape. Let me clear the canvas now.
The third icon creates only straight lines. Click on it and draw lines on the canvas.
"""Note, we cannot draw curved lines in this mode."""
We can draw triangles or polygons which have straight sides.
Click on the last icon and draw on the canvas.
"""In this mode, we can draw only parallel and perpendicular lines i.e. either vertical or horizontal lines."""
"""So, we can draw squares and rectangles in this mode."""
Let me delete all the shapes drawn.
Shape option helps to draw lines or curves in a particular shape.
Click on the drop-down button.
"""There are 5 options here- None, Triangle in, Triangle out, Ellipse, From clipboard."""
"""The first option that is None does not give any effect. So, we will move on to Triangle in."""
Click on it and draw a line on the canvas.
The line is transformed to a triangle shape inwards.
"""Next, click on Triangle out and draw a line on the canvas."""
Now a triangle shape is formed outwards.
Click on the Ellipse and draw a line.
Observe that the line is in ellipse shape.
We will learn about the last option that is From clipboard in later tutorial.
"""Now, let us learn how to add, edit and delete nodes."""
This can be done using the Node tool.
Delete the lines on the canvas.
Go to Tool controls bar. Change the Mode to regular path and Shape to None.
Come back to the canvas and draw a rough human palm.
"""Now, click on the Node tool."""
Notice all the nodes in this figure are visible.
Turn your attention to the Tool Controls bar.
"""The first 6 icons here, help to add and delete nodes and paths."""
Refer to the tool tip to understand better.
Click on any segment. Notice both the nodes turn blue.
Then click on the Add node option.
Observe that a new node has been added exactly in-between the nodes of the selected segment.
"""Now, select a smaller segment and repeat the above steps."""
You will see that a new node is added at the mid-point of the smaller segment.
"""Now, select the newly added node."""
Click on the Delete node option. The node is now deleted.
Click on any one of the nodes on the palm.
"""To make the Bezier handle visible, click on the last but one icon on the Tool controls bar."""
"""Now, the Bezier handles for the selected segment is visible."""
"""If not, then just click on the segment and without releasing the mouse, move it a little."""
The segment will curve and the Bezier handles will be visible now.
Click on the handles to resize and rotate the selected node.
"""In a similar way, modify the other nodes too."""
The next icon helps to join nodes.
"""Observe, there is an extra node on the index finger."""
Select the extra middle node and the top node by using the Shift key.
"""Now, click on Join node icon. Observe that the nodes are now joined together."""
The next icon helps to break path at selected nodes.
Let me now break the connection between the thumb and the index finger.
"""So, select the joining node in between and click on Break path icon."""
Un-select the node. Then select it again and move it a little.
You will notice that the path is broken and the nodes are separated into 2 distinct nodes.
"""To join them, select the same 2 nodes and click on the Join selected end-nodes icon on the Tool controls bar."""
"""Notice, a new path is created between these 2 nodes."""
Click on the next icon i.e. Delete segment icon to remove the path or segment. Now the path is removed.
Press Ctrl + Z to undo this action.
Let me keep this hand aside. Click on the Node tool once again.
Let us learn how to use next 4 icons on the Tool controls bar.
These icons help to edit the selected nodes.
"""Using the Bezier tool ,draw an inverted U shape. Click on the Node tool. Observe there are 3 nodes."""
Select the top node and click on Make selected nodes corner icon on the Tool controls bar.
This makes it as the corner node.
Click on the Bezier handles and move them up and down to see the change.
Click on the next icon to make the node smooth. Observe the change in the shape.
Click on the next icon which makes the node symmetric.
Click on the next icon which makes the node auto smooth.
"""The next 2 icons work only on segments. So, select the left segment of the U shape and click on the first icon."""
"""As the tool tip says, the segment is now made into a straight line."""
Click on the Bezier handle and try to move. You will see that we cannot make it curved.
Click on the next icon to make it a curved line again.
"""Now, move the Bezier handles and  now we can make it into a curve shape."""
Click on the next icon to convert selected object to path.
Click on the next icon to convert the stroke to path.
Click and drag the nodes to make the strokes visible.
The next 2 icons help to move the selected nodes in X and Y directions respectively.
Click on the up and down arrows and observe the change.
The next 2 icons work only if the path has clipping and masking effects.
You can explore these options on your own.
"""Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt to:"""
Draw straight lines and closed shapes
Draw curved lines
"""Add, edit and delete nodes."""
Here is an assignment for you-
"""Draw a flower with 5 petals, 1 stem and 2 leaves using Bezier tool."""
Color the petals with pink color.
Color the stem and leaves with green color.
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Introduction to Mozilla Firefox.
"""In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:"""
What is Mozilla Firefox?
Why Firefox?
"""Versions, System Requirements, Download and Install Firefox, Visit a website."""
"""""""Mozilla Firefox"""" or simply """"Firefox"""" is a free, open source web browser."""
"""It is the default web browser for Ubuntu Linux, serving as a window to the Internet."""
It allows you to view the Internet web-pages and navigate through the web pages.
"""It also searches for web pages using search engines such as Google, Yahoo Search or Bing."""
"""Firefox has been developed by volunteer programmers at the Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization."""
Visit 'mozilla.org' for detailed information on Mozilla.
"""Firefox works on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux Operating Systems."""
"""Some examples of other popular web browsers for Ubuntu are 'Konqueror', 'Google Chrome' and 'Opera'."""
"""In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 for Ubuntu 10.04."""
"""Firefox makes browsing better by bringing together speed, privacy and latest technologies."""
"""It has a variety of features such as tabbed windows, built-in spell checking, pop-up blocker, integrated web search, Phishing protection."""
"""Firefox provides faster web browsing with rapid rendering of graphics, improved page loading."""
"""It also offers a variety of security and privacy options against fraudulent websites, spyware and viruses, trojans or other malware."""
And it offers customization by way of add-ons and thousands of easy-to-install themes created by users.
"""Here are the System Requirements to run Firefox on Linux OS such as -Fedora, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Debian and SUSE."""
You will need the following libraries or packages to run Firefox on Ubuntu 10.04.
GTK+ 2.10 or higher
GLib 2.12 or higher
libstdc++ 4.3 or higher
Pango 1.14 or higher
X.Org 1.7 or higher.
And the recommended hardware are Pentium 4 or above with 512MB of RAM and 200MB of hard drive space.
"""For complete information on System requirements, visit the Firefox website shown on the screen."""
Let us now download and install Mozilla Firefox by visiting the official website at 'mozilla.com' as shown on the screen.
"""Here, we can always find the latest version of Firefox."""
"""Or we can click on the all Systems and Languages link, below the green area, for more options."""
Notice that Mozilla offers Firefox in over 70 languages.
"""Here, we can download various localized versions such as Hindi or Bengali."""
"""We can also choose the operating system: Windows, Mac or Linux by clicking on the various icons."""
"""In Ubuntu Linux, first select the location to save the file. By default, the Downloads directory in your 'Home page' folder is selected."""
"""Now you can select the Save File option and click on the OK button, appearing in the pop-up window."""
"""This will save Firefox archive to the Downloads directory, under the Home directory."""
Open a 'Terminal' Window and go to your Downloads directory by typing the following command: cd ~/Downloads.
"""Now, press the Enter key."""
Extract the contents of the downloaded file by typing the following command: tar xjf firefox-7.0.1.tar.bz2
Now press the Enter key.
This will start extracting the files required to run Firefox 7.0.
"""In the Terminal Window, go to the Firefox directory by typing the following command: cd firefox"""
This will take you to the Firefox directory.
"""To launch the Firefox browser, type the following command: ./firefox and press the Enter key."""
"""Alternately, you can launch Firefox by using the following command when your current directory is not the home directory."""
~/Downloads/firefox/firefox
We will see how to set up the default homepage later.
"""For now, as an example, let us go to 'Rediff.com' website that has the latest news and information."""
"""In the Address bar, below the menu bar, type: www.rediff.com."""
The content on the home page of 'Rediff.com' website is displayed.
"""Now, from this page, we can navigate to the various links to view contents in those pages."""
Let us click on the first link below the Headlines tab.
This is how we can visit websites using Firefox and then navigate to various pages from there.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on the awk command.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn 'awk' command."""
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Linux  Operating system GNU BASH 4.2.24"""
"""Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
Let us start with an introduction to awk.
The awk command is a very powerful text manipulation tool.
"""It is named after its authors, Aho, Weinberger and Kernighan."""
It can perform several functions.
It operates at the field level of a record.
"""So, it can easily access and edit the individual fields of the record."""
Let us see some examples.
"""For demonstration purpose, we use the awkdemo.txt file."""
Let us see the contents of awkdemo.txt file.
"""Now, open the terminal window."""
Let us see how to print using 'awk' command.
Type: awk space within single quote front-slash Pass  front- slash opening curly bracket print closing curly bracket (after the  quotes) space awkdemo.txt
press Enter.
"""Here, Pass is the selection criteria."""
All the lines of the awkdemo where Pass occurs are printed.
The action here is print.
We can also use regular expressions in awk.
"""Say, we want to print records of students with name Mira."""
We would type: awk space within single quotes front-slash capital M (/M) opening square-bracket  ei closing square-bracket asterisk-sign ra asterisk-sign front-slash space opening curly-bracket  print closing
(asterisk)  will give one or more occurrences of previous character.
"""Thus, entries with more than one occurrence for i, e and a will be listed."""
For example- Mira (with 'M'  'I'  'R'  'A')
Meera(with 'M'  'E'  'E'  'R'  'A')
Meeraa(with M E E R A A )
awk supports the extended regular expressions (ERE)
which means we can match multiple patterns separated by a PIPE.
Let me clear the prompt.
) electrical front slash space opening curly bracket print closing curly bracket after the quotes space awkdemo.txt
"""Press Enter."
"Now, entries for both civil and electrical are given."""
Let us go back to our slides.
Parameters: awk has some special parameters to identify individual fields of a line.
$1 (Dollar 1) would indicate the first field.
"""Similarly, we can have $2, $3 and so on for respective fields."""
$0 represents the entire line.
come back to our terminal.
Note that each word is separated by PIPE in the file awkdemo.txt.
"""In this case, PIPE is called a delimiter."""
A delimiter separates words from each other.
A delimiter can also be a single white space.
"""To specify a delimiter, we have to give '-F' (capital F) flag followed by a delimiter. Let us see."""
Type: awk space minus (capital) F space within double quotes  PIPE space within single quote front slash civil PIPE electrical front slash  opening curly bracket print space dollar0 closing curly bracket  aft
This prints the entire line since we have used $0.
Notice that names and stream of students are the second and third fields.
"""Say, we only want to print two fields."""
We will replace $0 with $2 and $3 in the above command.
Press Enter .
Only two fields are shown.
"""Though it gives the right result, the display is all jagged and un-formatted."""
We can provide formatted output by using the C style printf statement.
We can also provide a serial number by using a builtin variable NR.
We will see more about builtin variables later.
"""Now, type: awk space minus (capital) F within double quotes Pipe  after the double quotes space 'front slash Pass front slash opening curly-bracket printf  within double quotes  percentage-  sign 4d space pe"
We see the difference.
"""Here,  NR stands for number of records."""
"""Records are integers, hence we have written %d."""
Name and Stream are strings. So we have used %s.
"""Here, 25s will reserve 25 spaces for Name field."""
15s will reserve 15 spaces for Stream field.
The minus sign is used to left justify the output.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Let us move back to our slides.
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt:  To print using awk"""
Regular expression in awk to list the entries for a particular stream
To list only the second and the third fields
"""To display a formatted output. As an assignment,"""
"""Display roll no., stream and marks of Ankti Saraf"""

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Type Conversion in Java.
"""In this tutorial, we learn:"""
How to convert data from one data type to another.
"""The two types of conversion, namely implicit and explicit conversion and"""
How to convert strings to numbers.
"""For this tutorial we are using: Ubuntu v 11.10, JDK 1.6  and Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have  knowledge of data types in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown."""
Type conversion means converting data from one data type to another.
Let us see how it it done.
Switch to Eclipse.
Here we have the 'Eclipse IDE' and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
I have created a class TypeConversion and added the main method to it.
Now let us create a few variables.
int a  equal to 5; float b; b equal to a;
I have created two variables. a which is an integer and b which is a float.
I’m storing the integer value in a float variable.
Let us see what the float variable now contains.
System dot out dot  println(b);
Save the file and run it.
We can see that the integer 5 has been converted to float 5.0
This type of conversion is called implicit conversion.
"""As the name goes,  the value is automatically converted to suit the data type."""
"""Now let us convert float to an int, using the same method."""
"""Remove the 5,  float b equal to 2.5f  and let us store 'b' in 'a' and print the value of 'a'."""
we see that there is an error.
The error message  reads- Type mismatch: cannot convert from float to int.
It means Implicit conversion is possible only from an int to a float but not the the other way.
To convert a float to an  int we have to use explicit conversion.
Let us see how to do so.
"""We do that by using an int in parentheses, before the variable."""
This statement says the data in the variable 'b' has to be converted to int data type and stored in 'a'.
save and run the file.
"""As we can see, the float value has been converted to int."""
"""But to suit the data type, the data has been changed accordingly."""
Explicit conversion can also be used to convert data from int to float.
Let us try the previous example.
int a =5; float b; b = (float) a;
System.out.println(b);
We are using Explicit conversion to convert integer to a  float.
Save  the file and Run it.
we see that the int value has been converted to a float value.
Let us  see what happens when we convert a character to an integer.
int a; char c  equal to in single quotes m;
a equal to  (int) c;
System dot out dot println(a);
We are converting the character 'm' to an integer and printing the value.
Let us save and run it.
"""As we can see, the output is 109 which is the ascii value of 'm'."""
"""It means when a char is converted to int, its ascii value is stored."""
Let us try this with a digit.
char c = digit 5;
Save it and run it.
"""As we can see, the output is 53 which is the ascii value of the character ‘5’."""
It is not the number 5.
"""To get the number, we have to use a string and convert it to an integer."""
Now let us see how to do so.
Clean up the main function.
Type:
String sHeight meaning string form of Height equal to in double quotes 6
int h equal to explicit conversion  int of sHeight  and
System dot out dot  println(h) Save the file.
I’ve created a string variable with value 6 and I am trying to convert it to an integer but we see that there is an error
and the error message reads: Cannot cast from String to int.
"""This means, for converting strings, we cannot use implicit or explicit conversion."""
It must be done by other methods. let us use them.
Remove  int sHeight  and type  Integer dot parseInt sHeight;
we see that the value has been successfully converted to an integer.
"""To do this, we use the parseInt  method of the integer module."""
"""Now let us see what happens if there are more than one digits like """"6543"""""""
We see that again the string containing  the number has been successfully converted to an integer.
"""Now, let us see what happens if the string is a floating point number."""
"""Change """"6543"""" to """"65.43"""". So, we have a floating point number in a string and we are converting it to an integer."""
"""Save the file, run it."""
We see that there is an error. This happens because we cannot convert a   string  which contains floating point number into an integer.
We have to convert it to  a float. Let us see how to do so.
"""First, data type should be float,"""
second we will use Float. parseFloat.
We are using the parseFloat method of the float class to convert the string containing a floating point number into an actual floating point number.
"""Save the file, run it. We can  see that the string containing a floating point number  has been successfully converted  to a floating point number."""
And this is how we do implicit and explicit conversion and how we convert strings to numbers.
This brings us to  the end of the tutorial.
In this tutorial we have learnt: How to convert data from one type to another.
What is meant by implicit and  explicit conversion.
and How to convert strings to numbers.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial, read about the Integer.toString and Float.toString methods"""

Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial on built-in functions in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about different types of built-in functions like- Arithmetic functions,"""
"""String functions,"""
Input/Output functions and Time-stamp functions.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:  Ubuntu Linux 16.04 operating system and gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through the earlier awk tutorials on this website."""
You should have some knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
Built-in functions are always available for awk to call.
First we will learn about the arithmetic functions. square root function (sqrt (x)) returns positive square root of a number x.
int() function truncates x to an integer value.
exponential  function gives the exponential of x.
log function returns natural logarithm value of x.
sin and cos give sine(x) and cosine(x) respectively.
Please note that argument x should be mentioned in radians.
Let’s look at an example to understand these functions.
I have already written the code in a file arithmetic underscore function dot awk. The same is available in the Code Files link.
"""Here, we are printing the square root of a positive and negative number respectively."""
"""Next, we are printing the integer value for a positive and negative number respectively."""
Then we are printing exponential of a small number and a very large number.
"""After that, natural logarithm of positive and negative numbers are printed."""
"""We are also printing sine and cosine values of 0.52 radian, that is actually 30 degree. Let us execute the file in the terminal."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T Keys."""
"""Next, go to the folder where you have downloaded and extracted the file using cd command."""
"""Now, type: awk space -f space arithmetic_function.awk  and press Enter to see the output."""
Couple of things are clear from this output.
sqrt() function gives square root of a positive number.
It returns nan or not a number if the number is negative.
int() function gives the truncated integer of any positive or negative number.
"""exp() function gives exponential of a number. If the number is very large, the function will return inf."""
natural logarithm of positive number is given by log() function.
"""If the number is negative, the function returns nan."""
Sine and cosine functions return corresponding values. You can verify the values using your calculator.
"""Now, let us look at random functions."""
rand() function returns any random number between 0 and 1. But never returns 0 or 1.
Generated numbers will be random within one awk execution.
"""But, predictable across different executions of the awk program."""
srand(x) function is used to provide seed value x for random function.
"""In absence of x, date and time of day is used as the seed value. Let us understand these with an example."""
I have written a code for the random function and saved it as random.awk.
"""Here, inside the for loop, rand() function will generate a random number between 0 and 1."""
Then the generated number will be multiplied by 50 and get printed.
"""So, this code will generate 5 random numbers within 50."""
Switch to the terminal and execute the file. Let me clear the terminal.
Type: awk space hyphen f space random dot awk and press Enter.
"""See, it is giving 5 random numbers."""
What happens if I execute the code again?
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
"""We are getting the same output. Which means, awk is generating the same set of random numbers for every execution of the script."""
Then how can we get a new set of random numbers in every execution? Switch to the code once again.
"""Before the for loop, type srand() function."""
Press Ctrl and S keys to save the file.
"""Now, switch to the terminal."""
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command and press Enter.
It is giving a different set of random numbers.
"""So, we can generate a new set of random numbers using srand function when it’s used without an argument."""
Next we will see some string functions. length() function gives the length of a particular string s.
index() function determines the position of string s2 within the larger string s1.
"""For example- index within parentheses within double quotes linux comma within double quotes n, returns 3. Let us see an example."""
Open the file awkdemo.txt
We know that each student in the awkdemo.txt file has a 4 digit roll number.
"""Due to typing error, the roll numbers may have wrong number of digits. We can easily detect these using awk commands."""
Switch to the terminal . Let me clear the terminal.
"""Now, type the command as shown here. Here we are checking the length of the 1st field is equal to 4 or not."""
"""If not, then that particular record will get printed. Press Enter."""
"""See, there is one roll-number S02 that has been typed incorrectly."""
"""It has three digits, whereas all others have four digits."""
"""The substr(s,a,b) function extracts a substring from a larger string s."""
Let me explain the parameters.
Here s is the string.
a denotes the position in s from which the extraction would start.
b denotes the number of characters that would be extracted. Let us see one example.
Switch to the awkdemo.txt file.
"""Here, the first letter of the roll numbers represents the Hostel code where the particular student resides."""
"""Say, we want to find the list of students who are staying in Hostel A."""
"""To get that, let’s switch to the terminal."""
Type the command as shown here.
"""Here, we take the string denoted by $1."""
"""As we know, $1 represents the first field that is roll number in our case."""
"""Next, we extract a substring that starts at position one with the character length one."""
"""Then, if it is equal to capital A then that line from the file will get printed. Press Enter to see the output."""
We got the list of students who are in Hostel A.
"""We have seen the function split() earlier. So, I am not explaining the details here."""
Please refer to the earlier awk tutorials if you have any doubt.
There are some other functions which are related to Input/Output. system() function helps us to run any unix command within awk.
"""Now, we will run the unix command date through awk command."""
"""In the terminal, type the command as shown here. And press Enter."""
Today’s date and time is displayed on the terminal as an output.
"""Now, why do we need this? We have kept only the BEGIN section of the awk command."""
"""In real world scenarios, we may want to print the system date, before displaying the required output."""
"""In that case, we would need to execute system commands from awk command."""
"""There are some functions dealing with time stamps like - systime(),  strftime()  etc."""
Browse through the Internet to know about these functions.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about different types of built-in functions like- Arithmetic functions,   String functions,   Input/Output functions and   Time stamps functions."""
As an assignment- Write an awk program to print the last field of every record
where name of the student has small u as the third letter using the awkdemo.txt file.

Hello everyone. Welcome to the tutorial on Building GUIs using Netbeans.
"""In this tutorial, we will see one of the most attractive features of Netbeans which is its GUI Builder."""
What does Netbeans provide for building GUI?
It gives you a What You See Is What You Get designer to create your GUI.
"""Also, it gives you an easy interface to drag-and-drop components to create your layout."""
It comes with a component Palette with  pre installed AWT and Swing components.
We will be making use of this powerful visual editor to build a complete GUI application in just a few minutes.
"""For this demonstration, I'm using a system that has the Linux Operating system Ubuntu version 11.04 and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1."
"""For more details on the installation and requirements, please refer to the previous tutorial."""
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to use the Form Editor, Source Editor The Palette, Inspector and Properties features, add event handlers and also Compile and run our application."
Let's get started and build a simple Account balance application in this tutorial.
"""For this application, we want to be able to-"""
Input the amount credited to the account.
The amount debited from the account.
And compute the final balance.
We will also add a picture to make our application look more attractive.
Let's also have a menu bar on top for easy and quick navigation.
Let's now move to netbeans and start by creating a new project.
"""From the File menu, choose New Project > and choose a Java Application. Say Next"""
and give your project a name.
"""I will name my project as """"Account balance""""."""
Don't create a Main Class but set it as the Main Project.
Say Finish.  That should create a new project in your IDE.
"""Now, go back to File in the File menu and select  New File ."""
"""Choose Swing GUI Forms, under Categories"""
"""and  Jframe Form, under File Type."""
Say Next.
"""I'm going to call this """"AccountBalance"""" as well."""
But you can give it any other name you wish to.
"""Once you say Finish, it takes you to the main Design area."""
Let's get familiar with the GUI builder.
"""On the right, here is the Palette."""
This contains the pre-installed Swing and AWT components.
"""Down here, below the palette,  is the Properties window."""
This shows you the properties of the components as you choose them.
"""On the left,  here is the Navigator or the inspector"""
which  shows you the components that have been added to the frame
"""here, on the workspace, in the Design mode."""
"""On the top, here is the Source button."""
"""When you click on it, it takes you to the source code."""
"""As you add components to the design,"""
it takes the corresponding source code and adds it to the source here.
Let's go back to Design mode and see what components we'll use today.
We will be using some of the components from  the palette
"""such as Buttons, Labels, Panels,  Tabbed pane etc. to create our applications."""
"""Now, from  the  Palette, let us choose a Tabbed Pane under swing Containers."""
Select Tabbed Pane and click on the form.
This should give you a Tabbed frame. You can re-size it using your mouse.
"""Now, go back to the Palette and choose a Panel."""
And click again on your frame.
That should give you a tab.
Go back and choose another Panel. And click on the form again.
That gives you 2 tabs totally.
"""Now, you can rename the tab by either double-clicking on the tab or right-clicking on the tab and selecting the Edit Text option."""
"""I will call the first tab as """"Image"""" and rename the second tab to """"Balance""""."""
"""Now, let's go back to the Palette and add labels from  Swing Controls menu."""
Choose Label from the Swing Controls and add it to your form here.
We are going to need 6 labels for our application.
I have now added  six labels to my form.
You can position and align them as you click them.
"""And, also use the mouse to re-position or re-align them."""
"""Now, to change the text on a label-"""
You can either double-click on it or right-click on it
and  choose the option Edit Text.
Let us rename the labels now.
"""I'm going to call the first one as """"Initial Amount"""","""
"""the second label as """"Credit Amount"""","""
"""the third one as """"Debit Amount"""""""
"""and the fourth one as """"Balance""""."""
"""Initially, we'll set the Initial Amount to be Rs 5000."""
"""Once we compute the balance, we can put it into this label."""
"""But for now, we will just make it as stars."""
"""Now, go back to the Palette and choose a Text Field  and we will add two text fields, one each next to the Credit Amount and to the Debit Amount."""
We should also leave the Text field places blank.
Let me edit the text and remove the existing text here.
Let us resize it using the mouse.
"""Once you have done that, you can now go back to palette and choose a Button."""
Add the button below your frame and
you can change the label by right-clicking on it.
"""Choose the Edit Text option and name it as """"Get Balance""""."""
"""Now, this is our GUI!"""
Let's now go to the Image tab (tab1) and add an image.
"""To do that, let's go back to the Palette"""
and choose another Label and drop it on the panel.
"""Now, from the Properties  window below the palette, search for the icon property and click on the 3 dots here, on the right."""
The icon properties window opens.
"""Here, choose the option External Image, click on the (...) 3 dots again here, on the right."""
"""And, look for the image you want to include in your application."""
I have selected the image here. Click on OK.
Let us re-position it using the mouse.
You can remove the text here on the label by double-clicking on it and removing the text.
Now we have added in image.
Let us next add a menu to our GUI.
"""Go to the palette and select the Menu bar option, under swing menus."""
Choose Menu Bar and click here on top of the panel.
"""By default, it already has 2 menu labels: File and Edit."""
Double-click on the Edit Text and  rename it to Help.
You can also add a sub-menu  under File.
"""Now, in the Inspector or the Navigator on the left side, right-click on  JMenu1."""
Choose Add From Palette  option  and select Menu Item.
That should add a Menu Item.
You can also rename that to say Exit.
"""Now, we have added a sub-menu under the File menu and renamed that menu item as well."""
"""Now, our GUI is more or less complete."""
Let's now look at a preview.
Click on the 'Preview Design' button on the top.
That shows a preview of what you have done so far.
"""Here, the buttons don't work yet."""
"""But once you add in the code, you can have everything working."""
Let us close the preview.
"""Now, before adding the code, let's give proper variable names to the input text fields."""
"""Go to the Balance tab, let us give proper variable names to these text fields here."""
Right-click on JTextfield1 in the inspector.
Select Change Variable Name.
"""Let us change the variable name to  """"creditAmount""""."""
Click on OK.
"""You can also right-click on the text field here, in the Design mode."""
Select Change Variable Name
"""and change variable name into  """"debitAmount""""."""
"""I'm also going to call this final label i.e. the stars text field's label as """"resultBalance""""."""
"""Select the Change Variable Name  option again and change the variable to """"resultBalance""""."""
Click on OK.
"""Let's now see the code, to get the application working."""
"""Now, this is my sample code."""
"""What I want here is, to getText() from the """"creditAmount"""";"""
"""getText() from the """"debitAmount"""","""
"""compute the balance and place the amount in the final """"resultBalance""""."""
Let us  copy the code here and let us go back to the IDE.
"""Now, right-click on the Get Balance button."""
Choose the option Events >>  Action and Action Performed.
This will take you to the section of the code
where you will have to write or paste the code for the action to be performed on the button press.
Let me paste the copied code here.
Let's save this code and go back to the Design mode.
"""Now, let's add in the code to exit the application."""
Right-click on the Menu Item >> Exit and choose  Events >> Action and Action Performed.
It switches to the Source mode and now we have to write the code to exit successfully from the application.
That is going to be System.exit(1).
Now save the code and go back to Design mode.
Let us also add a shortcut to the Exit menu item.
"""Double-click on the shortcut option here, in the window that opens."""
Give the key stroke as Q and Ctrl and click on OK.
"""So, now we have set Ctrl Q as the keyboard shortcut to quit from the application."""
That's it. Our application is now complete..
Let's now run the application by pressing F6 on your keyboard.
It has already selected the main class that has to run.
"""And, here it is! This is our GUI."""
"""Now, let's run a check."""
"""Go to the Balance tab, enter the Credit Amount with Rs. 300/-"""
"""and  the Debit Amount as Rs. 200. And, say 'Get Balance'."""
That gives us the correct amount in the Balance.
Let us now exit from the application.
I'll go to File menu and I'll click on Exit.
We could have also quit the application by pressing Ctrl Q on the keyboard.
"""Now, with the application complete, it's time for the assignment."""
The task is to create a Temperature convertor application.
"""It should have two tabs like the previous one,"""
1 to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and another for Fahrenheit to Celsius.
It should also take an input  temperature
and display the converted temperature.
It should also have a menu bar on top that shows File and Help options.
"""And, under the File menu, have an Exit item with a keyboard shortcut to exit from the application."""
I have already solved the assignment.
Let us see how it should look.
I'm going to run my assignment and this is my GUI.
"""Now, let us enter the input temperature as -40 Celcius and let me click on Get Fahrenheit."""
The application should give the correct converted output temperature.
"""Now, let us  try the short-cut key to Exit i.e.  Ctrl X  to exit from  the application."""
"""So, we have successfully exited from the application upon the keyboard shortcut."""
"""If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch the videos."""

"""Spoken Tutorial project is a part of the Talk to a Teacher Project,"""
This tutorial has been contributed by IT for Change.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Pointers in C and C++ .
In this tutorial we will learn:
Pointers
To create Pointers
And operations on Pointers.
We will do this with the help of an example.
"To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10, gcc and g++ compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu."
Let us start with an introduction to pointers.
Pointers point to the locations in memory.
Pointers store the memory address.
It also gives value stored at that address.
"""Now, let us see an example on pointers."""
Note that our file name is pointers_demo.c.
Let us go through the code now.
This is our header file as stdio.h.
This is our main() function.
"""Here we have long integer num, assigned value 10."""
Then we have declared a pointer ptr.
Asterisk sign is used to declare a pointer.
This pointer can point to type long  int.
"""In the 'printf' statement, ampersand is used for retrieving memory address of the variable."""
"""So, ampersand num (&num) will give the memory address of num."""
This statement will print the address of the variable num.
"""Over here, ptr stores the address of num."""
This statement will print the address of ptr.
sizeof() function will give the size of ptr.
This is will give the value of ptr.
That is the memory address of num.
And here asterisk ptr will give the value at the address.
"""So, using asterisk will not give the memory address."""
Instead it will give the value.
%ld is a format specifier for the long int.
"""Now, let us execute the program."""
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To compile, type gcc space  pointers underscore demo dot c space hyphen o space point and press Enter."
Type dot slash point. Press Enter.
The output is displayed.
We see that the num address and ptr value is same
where as memory address of num and ptr are different.
Then the size of pointer is 8 bytes. Also the value pointed by ptr is 10 which was assigned to num.
Now let us see the same program in  C++.
Note that our file name is pointer underscore demo.cpp.
Here we have a few changes like the header file as iostream.
Then we are using the std namespace.
And here we have the cout function in place of printf() function.
Rest all the things are similar.
Let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.
"""To compile, type g++ space pointers_demo.cpp space hyphen o space point1, press Enter."""
"""Type dot slash point1, press Enter."""
We can see that the output is similar to our C program.
Come back to our slide.
"""Let us summarize.In this tutorial, we learnt:"""
About the pointer.
To create a pointer.
And operation on pointer.
"""As an assignment, write a C and C++ program to declare a variable and pointer. Store the address of variable in the pointer and print the value of the pointer."
Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Installing Software in Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to install software in Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System via: Terminal,"""
Synaptic Package Manager and  Ubuntu Software Center.
"""To record this tutorial, I’m using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System."""
"""To proceed with this tutorial, you must be connected to the internet."""
You need to be a System Administrator or have Administrator rights to install software.
Synaptic Package Manager is a graphical program for a p t.
It is a GUI for the apt-get command line utility.
"""By default, Synaptic Package Manager will not be pre-installed in Ubuntu Linux 16.04."""
"""So, let us learn how to install it via terminal."""
"""Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys together on your keyboard."""
"""Now, in the terminal, type: sudo space a p t hyphen get space install space s y n a p and press the Tab key."""
This will display list of software that starts with s y n a p.
Now complete the word as synaptic and press Enter.
You will be prompted to enter your administrator password.
Enter your admin password.
"""While typing password in the terminal, it will not be visible to us. So, type it carefully."""
Now the terminal  displays the list of packages to be installed.
"""And, information about the size of the files to be downloaded and disk space after installation."""
Press Y to confirm this.
"""The installation begins now. Depending upon your internet speed, this may take some time to finish."""
Now we have successfully installed Synaptic Package Manager.
Let us close the terminal.
"""To confirm the installation, go to Dash home. In the search bar, type synaptic."""
We can see the Synaptic Package Manager icon in the search result.
Now let us learn how to install software using Synaptic Package Manager.
Click on the Synaptic Package Manager icon.
An authentication dialog-box appears asking for the password.
Let us type the admin password and press Enter.
"""When we use the Synaptic Package Manager for the first time, an introduction dialog-box appears."""
This dialog-box has information on how to use Synaptic Package Manager.
Click on the Close button to close this dialog-box.
Let us configure Proxy and Repository in Synaptic Package Manager.
We have to do this before installing an application or package.
Go to Settings and click on Preferences.
There are several tabs on the Preferences window which appears on the screen.
Click on Network to configure the Proxy settings.
There are two options under the Proxy Server – Direct Connection and Manual Proxy.

Click on Mark button to mark all the dependencies packages automatically.
Go to the toolbar and click on the Apply button.
A Summary window appears showing the details of the packages to be installed
Click on the Apply button at the bottom to start the installation.
The process of installation will take some time.
This depends on the number and the size of the packages to be installed.
"""Applying Changes window will be closed, as soon as the installation gets completed."""
Close the Synaptic Package Manager window.
"""Now, let us verify whether the VLC player has been successfully installed."""
Go to the Dash home.
"""In the search bar, type vlc."""
We can see the VLC icon in the displayed list. Click on it to open it.
"""Likewise, we can install other applications using Synaptic Package Manager."""
Next we will learn how to install software via Ubuntu Software Center.
Ubuntu Software Centre is an application that allows us to manage software on Ubuntu Linux OS.
"""You can use it to search, download, install, update or uninstall a software."""
It also gives you information about the software even before you use it.
"""To open Ubuntu Software Center, go to the launcher."""
Click on the icon Ubuntu Software.
The Ubuntu Software Centre window appears.
"""At the top, we can see 3 tabs - All, Installed and Updates."""
Click on All tab.

This will help us to search the available software.
"""Now, let us install the software Inkscape."""
"""In the search bar, type inkscape."""
A short information about Inkscape is displayed.
"""Now, click on the Install button at the right corner."""
The Authentication dialog box appears.
Enter your admin password and then click on Authenticate button.
The progress bar indicates that Inkscape is being installed.
Installation may take a while depending on the number and size of the packages being installed.
The progress is also indicated in the Installed tab at the top. Click on it.
You can access other applications while any installation is being done.
Click on the word Inkscape.
This will display the information about Inkscape.
"""Once Inkscape is installed, we can see two buttons Remove and Launch next to it."""
"""If you want to uninstall the software, simply click on the Remove button."""
"""To launch the application, click on the Launch button. Let me click on it."""
This will launch the Inkscape application.
"""Go back to Ubuntu Software Center. Click on the back arrow button at the top left, and come back to the main screen."""
Now click on the tab Updates.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Layers and Boolean operations using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Layers"""
Filters Boolean operations.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.48.4"
Let us open Inkscape. Go to Dash homeand type Inkscape.
Click on the Inkscape logo.
Let's open the Assignment_2.svg file that we created earlier.
I had saved it in Documents folder.
"""First, we will learn about Layers in Inkscape."""
Go to Layer menu and click on Layers option.
"""Now, the Layer palette is opened on the right side of the interface."""
"""By default, a layer is there. You can see, that is named as Layer 1."""
"""To add or create a new layer, click on the plus icon on the Layer palette."""
A dialog box named Add layer opens up.
"""In the Layer name text box, we can assign a name to the layer."""
I will name this layer as eye.
"""Now, we can decide the position of the layer by clicking on the Position drop-down list."""
There are 3 options here.
Above current will keep this layer on top of the current layer.
Below current will place this layer below the current layer.
As sublayer of current indicates that it will be a part of the current layer.
I will position it as Above current and click on the Add button.
Notice a new layer named eye is now visible in the Layer palette.
"""In a similar way, create another layer named bow."""
Now we have 3 layers in the Layer palette.
"""Next, let us learn to rename a layer."""
"""First, double click on Layer 1. And then rename it as circle and press Enter."""
Coming back to our canvas... there are 2 eyes and a bow.
Let us move these shapes to the 2 different layers that we created.
Select both the eyes by dragging the mouse.
Now press Ctrl + X on your keyboard. The eyes have now disappeared.
Now click on the eye layer in the Layer Palette.
Come back to the canvas and press Ctrl + Alt + V.
Repeat the same action for the bow shape.
Click on any empty space on the canvas to deselect all the objects.
The eye and lock icons help to hide and lock layers.
"""When you hide a layer, you are able to see the objects on the subsequent lower layers clearly."""
"""When you lock a layer, you are able to prevent accidental edits to that particular layer."""
These are particularly useful when we have to work on large and complex graphic assignments.
"""Notice 2 icons namely- an eye and a lock, on the left of each layer."""
We will now learn how to use these.
"""To lock or unlock layers, click on the lock icon. I have now locked the bow layer."""
"""Note that if a layer is locked, we cannot make any changes to that layer."""
Let's try to select the bow on the canvas. You will notice that it is not possible to do so.
"""Now, I will unlock the bow layer."""
"""Now, I am able to select the bow object and change its properties as well."""
"""To make a layer visible or invisible on the canvas, click on the eye icon to the left of the layer."""
I am clicking on the eye icon for the bow layer.
Observe what happens on the canvas.
"""Now, let me duplicate the bow layer."""
Go to Layer menu and click on Duplicate Current Layer option.
Notice a new layer named bow copy is created in the Layer Palette window.
"""But, we cannot see the new bow on the canvas. That is because the bow object is overlapped on the previous layer."""
Select the bow on the top layer and move it to one side to see both the bows.
Select the circle layer.
Draw an ellipse on the canvas encircling the eyes and the bows. Color it orange.
The ellipse is seen in the background with the other objects visible above it.
The four icons next to the plus icon in the Layers Palette help to position the selected layer.
The first icon raises the selected layer to be the topmost layer.
The circle layer is currently selected.
"""Observe that on clicking, the circle layer now becomes the topmost layer."""
The last icon lowers the selected layer to be the bottom-most layer.
Click on this icon. Observe that the circle layer is now the bottom-most layer.
"""The second icon raises the selected layer, one layer above."""
Click on this icon. The circle layer has moved above the eye layer. So the eyes are not visible.
"""The third icon lowers the selected layer, one layer below."""
Click on this icon. Now the circle layer has moved below the eye layer.
"""So, that is how these four icons can be used."""
The minus icon at the end will delete the selected layer. Select the bow copy layer and click on it.
Observe that the bow copy layer is no longer seen.
Blend mode is a shortcut to apply the Blend filter to an entire layer.
"""This means that if objects overlap on the selected layers, Inkscape will do a pixel-by-pixel blend of the two objects."""
"""So, keep the circle layer on the top to make the filters visible."""
Click on the drop-down list of the Blend mode. Notice there are 5 options.
"""The first option, that is Normal, does not add any filter to the layer."""
"""Let me click on it. Observe, no filter is added to the layer."""
"""Next, click on Multiply."""
Notice that objects on the topmost layer filters the light so that the objects on the bottom layers are visible.
"""At the same time, it also blends or mixes the colors to form darker colors in the overlap regions."""
Next option is Screen.
Observe the top objects; they add lightness to the bottom objects.
"""So, it blends or mixes the colours to form lighter colours in the overlap regions."""
"""Select Darken. The objects on the top layer, darken the objects on the bottom layers."""
"""Now, let us select the last option that is Lighten. Here the top objects lighten the bottom objects."""
"""If at any time you return the Blend mode back to Normal, the blend filters applied so far disappear."""
We can see many more filters in the Filters menu.
"""To apply any particular filter, first select the object and then click on the desired filter."""
Move the circle layer to the bottom again.
Let me select an eye. Go to Filters menu. Select Blur and Fancy blur.
Observe the changes on the eye.
Let me select the other eye. Go to Filters menu. Select Bevel and Smart jelly.
Once again observe the changes applied to the eye.
"""Now, select the bow. Go to Filters menu. Select Scatter and Air spray."""

"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
Let's start the tutorial with an e-mail which I got.
I got an email by David Vansalan and he asked me how to draw simple figures with geometries with GIMP.
"""So, let's first start with the most easy way i.e with the straight line."""
"""A straight line can be difficult to draw but if you make a point here and press the shift key and make another point, you can easily draw a straight line."""
"""So, these are straight lines."""
Press Ctrl + Z to Undo.
A square is a bit more complicated.
Just go to toolbox and select the Rectangle tool.
And keep the Aspect ratio as 3 by 3.
"""So, it should be a square."""
"""Now, I have a square selection. So, go to Edit >> Stroke Selection."""
I can do some changes here.
I can fix the Line width or I can use the paint tool and I select Paintbrush in paint tool and click on Stroke.
And here you have your square.
"""If I want to fill this square, it's easy, just go here to my colour pallet and drag the black colour into the square."""
The same can be done with the ellipse selection.
I just can select Ellipse and go to Edit and select Stroke Selection.
"""For more complicated figures, select Paths Tool."""
"""I can create a path by making points and when I click on the last point, my path is finished."""
Then I can go here to Edit and start to modify these handles the way you want to.
You can practice it and understand.
It's very easy.
The last thing I want to do is stroke the path.
"""And I get the same options here and when I click on Stroke, I have a perfect line."""
It's not a straight line but its perfect line.
And this was it for this week.

"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial Project."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on custom exceptions.
In this tutorial we will learn about:  Custom exceptions and  Usage of throw and throws keywords
"""To record this tutorial, I am using :Ubuntu Linux 16.04 OS JDK 1 .7 and Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have basic knowledge of Exceptions Handling in Java. If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
First let us learn about custom exceptions.
Custom exception is a user defined exception class.  It is usually created as checked exceptions.
It is used to customize the exception according to user need.
Now we will open eclipse and create a new project called CustomExceptionDemo.
Inside this project we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate custom exceptions.
We will create a new class InvalidMarkException.
"""To make this as a type of exception class, it should be a subclass of Java exception class."""
"""To do so, type extends Exception."""
Click on Source menu and then select Generate constructors from Superclass.
Now click on Deselect All button in the right hand side.
Then select the constructor with a single string argument and click on OK button at the bottom.
This string argument can be used to customize the message shown when this exception occurs.<<PAUSE>>
Let us add another class named StudentMarks.
Then type the following code.
This class contains only one variable named marks.
This constructor initializes the value of marks.
Let us now add a method to validate the marks.
The normal range of marks is from 0 to 100.
"""If marks less than 0 or greater than 100 is processed, InvalidMarkException will be thrown."""
"""For this, we need to use the throw keyword explicitly to throw a custom exception."""
"""If the mark is a valid one, the message “Entry OK” will be displayed."""
We can see that there is an error InvalidMarkException.
Let us check and resolve it.
So click on the error and double click “Add throws declaration”.
We can see that the error disappears once the “throws InvalidMarkException” is added to the method signature.
Here we can see that the throws keyword is used along with methods.
It indicates that the method will raise the specified exception.
We have to provide the exception handling code when such a method is called.
"""Next, let us perform a file access operation which will raise a FileNotFoundException."""
So type the following code to create an instance of a FileReader class.
Eclipse will show some errors as we have not imported the corresponding Java packages.
"""To rectify the same, click on the error and then double click import 'FileReader' (java.io)."""
We will learn about package and its usage in detail in a later tutorial.
"""To allow fr to access a file called Marks which is located in the home folder, type the following code."""
The path shown here is to be replaced with that of your system's home folder.
An error shows that this line of code can raise a FileNotFoundException.
We can resolve it by adding this exception in the throws clause.
We can see that FileNotFoundException is also added to the throws clause.
We can handle multiple exceptions using throws as shown here.
We will now create the main method inside the StudentMarks class and verify the results.
Here we create an object m1 initialized with 40 as the value for marks.
In04: the next line we invoke the method validate using the object m1.
We can see that there is an error when the validate method is invoked.
It says that this method will raise the  InvalidMarkException and FileNotFoundException
"""To resolve the error, we can add throws clause to main method as we did earlier"""
But it is recommended to use try and catch block.
"""So, double click Surround with try/catch."""
Now the necessary try-catch blocks are added and the exception has been handled.
Now let us run this program.
It displays “Entry OK” and “rest of the code”.
This happens because the value of marks 40 is a valid entry.
Let us now change the value to -10 which is an invalid entry.
We will run the program again.
Now we can see that the InvalidMarkException is thrown as -10 is an invalid entry.
"""Since we have handled the exception, we can see the message “rest of the code”"""
"""Instead if we use “throws” clause, this message “rest of the code” will not be printed."""
Also the program will be terminated.
So it is better to use a try catch block when a method is called inside the main method.
With this we come to the end of this tutorial.
In this tutorial we have learned about :What is a Custom Exception Usage of throw and throws keywords How to create and use custom exceptions.
As an assignment :Create a custom exception class called InvalidAgeException
Create another class Age and create a constructor to initialize the value of age
Also create a method validate to throw an exception if the age is less than 18
Create objects inside the main method and invoke the validate() method
Provide exception handling using try-catch blocks wherever required.
Verify the custom exception class.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Configuring Settings in KTouch.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to:"""
Change the level of training Adjust the speed of typing.
Configure shortcut keys.Configure the toolbars.View typing metrics.
"""Here, we are using KTouch 1.7.1 on Ubuntu Linux 11.10."""
Let’s open KTouch.
We are at Level 1. Let us move on to the second level that is 2.
"""To increase the level of the training to 2, click on the top triangle symbol, next to the Level field."""
Notice what happens when we change the level to 2.
The characters in the Teacher’s Line change!
Look at the characters displayed under the New Characters in This Level field. They’ve changed too!
These are the characters that are to be practiced for the selected level.
"""Now, let’s start typing."""
Now let us type a character that is not displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
The Student's Line changes to red.
What else do you see?
The percentage displayed in the Correctness field decreases.
Let’s press backspace and delete the mistake.
Let us learn to set Training Options.
What are Training Options?
We use 'Training Options' to change the parameters for typing speed and correctness (percentage of typing accuracy).
We can also customize the number of lines that can be typed in a particular level.
"""From the main menu, select Settings and click Configure KTouch."""
The Configure – KTouch dialog box appears.
"""From the left panel of the Configure – KTouch dialog box, click Training Options."""
The right panel now displays the various 'Training Options'.
"""Let’s set the upper limit for the Typing speed, Correctness and Workload."""
"""Under Limits to increase a level, let us:"""
"""set the Typing Speed to 120 characters per minute, Correctness to 85%."""
Finally let’s set Workload to 1.
This means that we need to complete only one line in each level.
We then will automatically move to the next level.
"""If you want to complete the training for a level before you proceed to the next level, check the """"Complete whole training level before proceeding"""" box."""
Let’s set the lower limit for the Typing speed and Correctness.
"""Under Limits to decrease a level, let us:"""
set the Typing Speed to 60 characters per minute and Correctness to 60.
Let’s check the box Remember level for next program start.
Click Apply. Click OK.
Changes we made are applied only when we start a new session again.
Click Start New Session and select Keep Current Level.
Let’s start typing again.
Notice that initially the speed is 0. It increases or decreases as we type.
Click Pause Session. When we pause the typing speed remains at the same count.
Let us resume typing.
"""As the speed drops below 60, notice that the red circle next to Speed is glowing."""
"""This indicates that speed has fallen below the lower limit, that is 60, set for the speed."""
"""Now, type the number 4 that is not displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'."""
The 'Student’s Line' turns red.
The percentage of the Correctness drops too.
Can you see the spaces between set of characters or character given in the 'Teacher’s Line'?
"""Now, I shall not press the Space bar after this word."""
The 'Student’s Line' has turned red again!
This means the spaces too must be typed in correctly.
Let us complete typing an entire line in the student’s line and then press Enter.
The Level has changed to 3!
Why does the level change to 3? This is because we have set the Workload to 1.
"""Therefore, when we complete one line for Level 2 and press Enter, we move to the next level."""
Notice that the new characters are displayed in the 'Teacher’s Line'.
Do you want to know the scores of our typing session?
Click Lecture Statistics. The Training statistics dialog box appears.
"""Let’s click on the """"tabs"""" and see what each of them indicate."""
Click on Current Training Session.
"""This displays the general statistics details, rate of typing, accuracy of typing and details of the characters that you need to concentrate on."""
The Current Level Statistics tab displays details similar to the one displayed in the Current Training Session tab.
The Monitor Progress tab displays a graphical representation of the progress of your typing.
Let us close this dialog box.
"""You can also create your own """"shortcut keys""""."""
What are shortcut keys?
"""Shortcut keys are combinations of two or more keys which can be pressed from the keyboard, instead of using the menu options."""
Let us configure a shortcut key to view Lecture Statistics.
"""From the main menu, click Settings > Configure Shortcuts."""
The Configure Shortcuts – KTouch dialog box appears.
In the Search box enter Lecture Statistics.
Click Lecture Statistics. Select Custom and click None. The icon changes to Input.
"""Now, from the keyboard, press the Shift and A keys together."""
"""Notice that the icon now displays the letters """"Shift+A"""". Click OK."""
"""Now, press the Shift and A keys together. The Training Statistics dialog box appears."""
Click Close to exit.
KTouch also allows you to configure toolbars.
Let us say we want to display the Quit Ktouch command as an icon.
"""From the main menu, click Settings and click Configure Toolbars."""
The Configure Toolbars – KTouch dialog box appears.
"""In the left panel, from the list of option, select the Quit icon. Double-click on it."""
The icon is moved to the right panel.   Click Apply and then click OK.
The Quit icon is now displayed on the KTouch window.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on KTouch.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on “Trace bitmap in Inkscape” using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial we will learn the Difference between raster and vector image, Various raster and vector formats, Convert raster image to vector"""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS , Inkscape version 0.91"""
"""The images used as examples in this tutorial, have been provided in the Code Files link."""
Pause the tutorial here and download the images on your machine.
Here are the 2 images on my desktop.
Linux.png is the raster image and Linux.pdf is the vector image.
Let me open them.
Both the images may look similar. We will know the difference only by zooming into the image. Let's do so.
"""Now, the first image looks pixelated because a raster image is made of up pixels."""
But the second image does not pixelate because a vector image is made up of paths.
"""Some of the raster image formats are JPEG, PNG,TIFF,GIF, BMP etc"""
"""Some of the vector image formats are SVG,AI, CGM etc"""
"""The formats that can be both vector and raster are PDF, EPS, SWF"""
Let us now learn how to convert this raster image to vector.
"""Open Inkscape. Now, we will import the raster image."""
Go to File and click on Import.
"""Now, go to Path menu and click on Trace Bitmap."""
A dialog box opens up. Under the Mode tab we can see various options.
"""Make sure the image is selected.  By default, Brightness cutoff option is selected."""
"""Under Preview, check the Live Preview option to observe the changes."""
"""As you can see in the Preview window, Brightness cutoff finds the difference in brightness."""
"""Now click on the second option, that is Edge detection."""
"""As the name indicates, it finds only the edges."""
Color quantization traces along the boundaries of reduced colors.
Invert image will invert the colors of the bitmap if you think it looks better inverted.
I will uncheck the Invert image.
Multiple scans is good for multiple colors.
Brightness steps finds the difference in brightness.
Colors finds an amount of colors specified.
"""Grays is similar to Colors, but finds only grayscale colors. Uncheck the Smooth option, since it creates more smooth lines in the edges."""
Now we have seen all the tracing options. You can choose from any of these according to your requirement.
I will choose Colors options by clicking on it.
Now click on OK and close the dialog box.
The traced image in created on the top of the original image.
Click and move the image to one side in order to see both the images.
The image is now converted into vector. Zoom in to the images.
"""As mentioned earlier the first image gets pixelated, while the second one does not gets pixelated."""
And we can also see the paths very clearly.
"""Now, delete the original image."""
Select the image. Go to Path. Click on Break Apart.
Now double click on the image. Stack of images are created on the top of the other.
Click and drag them aside to make it visible.
Next let us learn how to edit the vector image. I will edit the black image.
So delete the other images.
Make sure the image is selected.
Go to Path. Click on Break Apart.
"""Under Fill and Stroke, reduce the opacity to 50. Now you can see the parts clearly."""
Let us change the colors of the image.
You can change the colors according to your imagination.
Now select all the parts and increase the opacity to 100.
Press Ctrl + G to group them all together.
"""Now let us add some hair-style. To do so, select the image and click on the Nodes tool."""
Add nodes to the head area. Now move the nodes a little up as demonstrated.
Save the image in both raster and vector formats.
"""First save it as raster, that is, in PNG format. Go to File and then click on Save As."""
Change the name as Image-raster. Click on Save.
"""Next let us save the image as vector, that is, in PDF format."""
"""Once again, go to File and click on Save As."""
Change the extension to PDF . Change the name as Image-vector. Click on Save.
Now let us go to the desktop and check both the images.
You can clearly identify the difference between the two images.
That's all for this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt the Difference between raster and vector image Various raster and vector formats, Convert raster image to vector"""
"""As an assignment, select the train image which is given in your code files link and convert it to a vector in Grays."""
Your completed assignment should like this.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on FrontAccounting installation on Windows OS.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to Install XAMPP"""
Do the database setup and Install FrontAccounting in Windows OS
"""To record this tutorial, I‘m using: Windows OS version 10"""
"""Apache, MySQL and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.5.19"""
FrontAccounting version 2.4.7
Firefox web browser and  A working Internet connection.
FrontAccounting is a server based Accounting System. So we will be using XAMPP to setup the web server on our machine.
"""Open a web browser. In the address bar, type this URL and press Enter."""
This will take us to the XAMPP download page.
Here XAMPP is available to download for all operating systems.
The latest version of XAMPP can be downloaded by clicking this green button.
"""However, depending upon your software requirement, you may need a different version of XAMPP."""
In my case I need XAMPP version 5.5.19.
Click on XAMPP Windows link.
The redirected page will display all the XAMPP versions till date.
"""For this installation, I will select the XAMPP version 5.5.19"""
Click on the link to download.
"""Now, click on Save file button. The exe file will get downloaded on our machine."""
Open the folder where you have downloaded the file.
Double-click on the file to start the installation.
A User Account Control dialog box opens up. Click on the Yes button.
"""If you have installed any antivirus software on your machine, you may get another popup window. Click on the Yes button."""
"""In the next window, click on the OK button to ignore the warning message."""
Click on the Next button whenever prompted and follow the installation steps as shown.
Uncheck the Learn more about Bitnami for XAMPP check box. Then continue by clicking on the Next button.
"""Once the installation is done, uncheck the Do you want to start the Control Panel now? checkbox."""
"""Lastly, click on Finish button."""
Now we should check whether XAMPP is successfully installed on our machine or not.
Click on the Windows search bar at the bottom left of the screen and type xampp.
We can see the XAMPP Control Panel in the search list.
Right-click on the XAMPP Control Panel and select Run as administrator.
"""In the XAMPP Control Panel, make sure that Apache and MySQL services are running."""
"""If not, then start these services by clicking on the START button of the respective services."""
You may get some error messages like: “Apache shutdown unexpectedly”
“Port 80 in use for Apache Server'”
This is because the default port allotted to Apache and MySQL are taken by another software.
Default port number for Apache is 80 and for MySQL is 3306.
"""To change these ports, refer to the Additional Reading Material of this tutorial."""
And allot the proper port numbers before proceeding further. For eg: 8080
"""Now, open Firefox web browser."""
"""In the address bar, type localhost and press Enter. We should be able to see the XAMPP screen."""
"""If prompted for language selection, select English. We are now in the XAMPP homepage."""
Let's start downloading FrontAccounting.

Right-click on the file and select Extract Here.
"""Once extracted, I will rename the extracted FrontAccounting folder as account."""
"""Renaming of the folder name is optional. However, it helps to identify multiple instances of FrontAccounting installed on a single machine."""
Now we have to move the folder account into the web server's root directory.
The path for the root directory is “c:\xampp\htdocs”
Right-click on the folder account and select Copy.
"""In the left pane, click on “This PC” which is also called as “My Computer”."""
Then double click on “Local Disk (C:)” that is C drive And go to xampp and htdocs.
"""Inside htdocs, right-click on an empty space and select Paste."""
We have successfully installed the XAMPP server.
Make sure that the FrontAccounting installer is in the web server’s root directory.
Next we need to create a database for FrontAccounting to proceed further.
"""We will do this in phpmyadmin, which is the graphical user interface for MySQL. It comes along with the XAMPP installation."""
Let us go back to the XAMPP Page in the web browser.
"""On the XAMPP page, in the menu at the left, click on phpMyadmin."""
Click on Users in the top menu and then click on Add User.
In the new window that opens enter a User name of your choice. I will type frontacc as my User name.
"""From the Host drop-down list, select Local."""
Enter a password of your choice in the Password text-box.
I will type admin123 as my password.
Type the same password in the Re-type textbox.
Do not click on Generate Password prompt for now.
"""Under Database for user account, we can see the option- Create database with the same name and grant all privileges."""
We will check that option and scroll down.

"""Spoken Tutorial Project is funded by NMEICT, MHRD, Government of India.  More information on this mission is available at the link shown."""
Hello and welcome to this spoken tutorial- More on single dimensional array in awk.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about- Using awk array with file,"""
"""scan the elements of an array,"""
"""Delete statement,"""
ARGV array and ENVIRON array.
We will do this through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 Operating System and  gedit text editor 3.20.1"""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have gone through previous awk tutorial on array in our website."""
You should have some basic knowledge of any programming language like C or C++.
"""If not, then please go through the corresponding tutorials on our website."""
The files used in this tutorial are available in the Code Files link on this tutorial page. Please download and extract them.
Previously we covered some aspects of awk arrays.
Now let us see how we can use awk array with a file.
We will use the same file awkdemo.txt that we have used earlier.
"""Here, the first field is roll number and sixth field is stipend of the student."""
Let us first calculate the HRA for all students.
"""Here, HRA is 30% of their stipend amount."""
I have already written the code and saved it as calculate_hra.awk. Let us look into that file now.
"""Inside the BEGIN section, the field separator is initialized with the Pipe symbol."""
"""Then, in the action section we are initializing the array elements."""
This section will get executed once for each line of an input file.
"""I have declared """"hra"""" as an array variable and dollar one as index."""
"""Here dollar 1 indicates the 1st field, that is roll number. And, the value is dollar 6 multiplied by zero point 3 wherein dollar six is the stipend value."""
"""So, array hra at index roll number will contain the corresponding HRA amount as a value."""
How can we scan all the elements of this array?
You should use this variation of for loop.
This loop executes statements once for each index in the array.
The variable var will be set to the index values one by one.
The code is written inside END section.
This section will be executed after awk has processed all the lines of the input file.
Variable i will be initialized to every index value or roll number one by one.
"""In each iteration of the for loop, the HRA for a particular roll number will be printed."""
"""Switch to the terminal and execute the file. Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys."""
Go to the folder in which you downloaded and extracted the Code Files using 'cd' command.
"""Now, type: awk space hyphen small f space calculate_hra.awk space awkdemo.txt . Press Enter."""
The output shows the roll number and HRA for all the students.
"""Now say, I want to delete the record for the student with roll S02."""
"""So, we have to delete the array element at index S02."""
Let me do this using the calculate_hra.awk code.
"""Before the for loop, press Enter and type the following code: delete space hra within square brackets within double quotes S02."""
Save the file and switch to the terminal.
Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command. Press Enter.
The record for the student with roll number S02 is not printed in the output.
"""So, any array element can be deleted using the delete command."""
You have to mention the array name with the index.
What if I want to delete an entire array? It can be done by specifying only the array name in the delete statement.
Let us switch to the code to try this.
Delete the index S02 along with the quotes and square brackets from the delete statement.
Clear the terminal. Press the up arrow key to get the previously executed command. Now press Enter.
"""See, we are not getting any output. The entire array has been deleted."""
"""Remember, in an earlier tutorial on awk built-in variables, we had said- ARGC implies the number of command line arguments."""
ARGV is an array that stores the command line arguments. How can we show their values? Let us see.
I have already written the code in argc_argv.awk. Let us check the contents.
The code is written within awk BEGIN section.
"""First we are printing the number of arguments, that is the value of ARGC."""
"""Next, using the for loop, we are looping for the value of i from 0 to ARGC-1."""
"""And, we are printing ARGV at index i. Switch to the terminal and execute the file."""
"""Now, type on the terminal- awk space hyphen small f space argc underscore argv dot awk space one space two space three."""
"""Here, one two three are the command line arguments. Press Enter to execute the command."""
We get the number of arguments as 4. But recall that we have supplied only 3 arguments.
"""Let us have a look at the individual arguments. First argument or argv at index 0 is actually awk, the command name."""
"""Next, we have three arguments that we supplied in the command line."""
That is why the value of ARGC is always the number of command line arguments supplied plus one.
Let us take one more example. Built-in variable ENVIRON is an associative array of environment variables.
The array element indices are the environment variable names. The array element values are the values of the particular environment variables.
Let us see how we can see the values of different environment variables.
"""First, let us print our username."""
We need to print the value of environment variable USER.
"""At the command prompt, type the following."""
The output will show the name of the user who logged in.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about- Using awk array with file,"""
"""Scan the elements of an array,"""
"""Delete statement, ARGV array and ENVIRON array."""
As an assignment- Calculate certain allowances for the students who have passed.
"""Paper presentation allowance which is 80% of the stipend,"""
Performance incentive which is 20% of the stipend.
Store the allowances in two different arrays.
Print the total amount required for each allowance and the average.
Print the value of environment variable PATH from awk program.

"""On the next page which loads,"""
click on the 'Download' link in the last column which includes the download of all the supported technologies that is required by the IDE including the Glassfish Server.
The installation of Netbeans also requires the installation of the Java Development Kit (JDK) which can be downloaded from java.sun.com.
Click on the Get Java link here and select the link to download both the Netbeans and 'JDK' Bundle.
"""In the next page which loads,"""
select the setup file which is compatible with your operating system.
"""On Ubuntu, the setup-file is downloaded as a  '.sh' (dot sh) file"""
i.e as a shell script file.
Run this file by going to the Terminal.
"""Navigate to the window or directory which contains the downloaded setup file and at the prompt,"""
"""type """"sh"""" followed by the name of the downloaded file and press Enter."""
This will start the installer which will take a few moments.
The installer appears on the screen.
You can follow the onscreen instructions to install the IDE on your system.
I will exit the installer now.
Let us now look at the Netbeans window.
To open or launch Netbeans on your Ubuntu Operating System-
Go to the menu item Applications >> Programming and click on the Netbeans IDE icon.
"""When you first launch the IDE, it opens the Netbeans start page."""
The IDE window contains
"""menus in the menu bar,"""
toolbars  and
"""workspaces like the file system window,"""
the run time window and the output window.
"""The  main menu provides most of the commands you need to use Netbeans with, including-"""
"""creating, editing, compiling, running and debugging your projects."""
The tool bar which is present below the menu bar  provides buttons for several frequently used commands on the menu bar.
Workspace is a collection of windows that are used for performing certain types of operations
"""such as editing in the workspace window , execution, output or debugging- which is present below the workspace."""
Let us next create a Sample Java Project.
"""To create a java project, go to the File menu, click on New Project."""
"""In the 'New project' Wizard box, under Categories ,"""
"""select Java. Under Projects, select Java Applications and click Next."""
"""In the Name and Location page  of the wizard,"""
"""give your Project Name as """"KeyboardReader""""."""
Set the Set as Main Project check-box selected and
click Finish.
The project is created and opened in the IDE.
"""Once the project is created, you should be able to  see the Projects window on the left  side of the IDE windows"""
"""which contains a tree view of the components of the project including the source files, Libraries that your code depends on."""
The Source Editor  is on the right with a file called  as  KeyboardReader.java  opened.
"""Now, in the main class, let us enter a sample java code."""
This code reads input from the keyboard and gives an output indicating if the input is a whole number or a floating point number.
I am now copying this code onto my clipboard and pasting it over the existing code in the IDE workspace.
The next step is to run our project.
"""To run any project on the Netbeans IDE, there are 3 methods."""
The first method is- you can click on the project node in the Projects window and choose Run from the contextual menu.
"""Or, you can go to the toolbar and click on the Run Project button."""
"""Or, you can also  press the F6 key on your keyboard to run the project."""
Let me right-click on the Project node and select the Run option.
"""When you run a Java application, the IDE builds and compiles the  application code and runs the program in the output window which appears below the Workspace."""
"""The IDE has now prompted me to """"Enter any Number""""."""
Let me enter a random number and press Enter.
It says if the input is a whole number or a floating point number.
"""Now, to the assignment-"""
"""As an extension to the """"KeyboardInputReader"""" project,"""
"""convert another project i.e. a temperatures converter application which takes an input temperature,"""
converts into Fahrenheit from Celsius and vice-versa.
"""And, displays the converted temperature in the output window."""
I have already constructed the assignment.
Let us run the assignment.
The program has prompted me to enter the input temperature in the output window.
"""Let me enter a sample temperature, -40, in Fahrenheit and it shows me the converted temperature in Celsius."""

Welcome to Meet The GIMP.
"""My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""I got an e-mail from Jeson in New York and he just stopped the show about Triptychs, to find a different way of doing it, before I started doing triptychs."""
And he found a different way with using layer mask.
And I think I should show you that in this tutorial.
"""I can't show you the image which Jeson used for doing Triptychs because he used images which are not freely available, so I can't use them."""
Using layer mask for doing Triptychs is very easy and I have modified his concept a bit about using a layer mask.
I wonder why I didn't have that idea.
And I want to do a triptych with these three shots here.
"""I want to have this image on the left side, this 2nd one in the middle and this one on the right side."""
I want to change these square frames to something which suits this image.
We will see how this works out.
Now I can start making the Triptychs with these images here and I press tab to bring my toolbox window into the foreground.
Click on File and select New to create a new image and we get the default value of width as 3400 and 1200 for height.
So I have three images of 1000 by 1000 and 100 pixels border between them.
Let's see how that works out.
"""For getting this image into the new image, I drag the 'Background' layer of this image from toolbox to my new image here and you get here 'Background copy'."""
"""This was my left most image, so I rename it as """"left"""" and I press return/Enter after typing."""
So this image should be on the left side.
"""And the next image should be on right side, so I pull the image in the same way and name it accordingly """"right""""."""
"""And this is the third image and this will become my central window, so I pull this image over to the new image and rename this layer as """"center""""."""
"""I make the """"right"""" and """"central"""" layers invisible and now I want to scale the """"left"""" layer a bit down and when I zoom down a bit to say 10%, you can see the borders of this layer and now the full frame"
And now I select the Move tool so that I can move this image and adjust a bit.
The image is not moving because I have selected the center layer.
"""So, I select the left layer and move it and position the bottle."""
"""I want to scale down this layer a bit, so I select the Scale tool from the toolbox and go to the tool info. and click on aspect ratio and in Preview I choose the Image option."""
"""And now, I click into the layer, and pull the info window aside and reduce it from the corner."""
I think more or bit less.
I can grab this image and I can position it where I want to and I think I should have put some guidelines on here.
"""So, I zoom into the image by 100% and go to the top left corner."""
Now I pull the rulers down here for guidelines.
I wondered why I couldn’t move a ruler and here is an option Move the active layer. By selecting it I can move the active layer.
It's a nice option to protect the layers and I select the size of the frame as 100 on the right side and I go down and I set it 1100 and on right side I set it as 1100.
This is the frame for my image.
Shift + Ctrl + E gives me the whole image and now I select the active layer option.
"""And in Zoom Ratio, I select 10%."""
"""I think, I should select 13% and that's enough."""
I click on Scale tool and keep the aspect ratio and pull this Scale window out of the frame.
Now I scale this image.
Now I have the frame to look where I want to place this image.
"""And I think I should make it a bit smaller because I want to have the shades of glass here, in the image."""
Now I click on Scale and I get my scaled image.
"""For getting the frame around the image, I just add a layer mask."""
And I make my layer mask Black i.e full transparency.
And just click on Add.
"""So, now I select a rectangle inside the borders here and fill the rectangle with white."""
"""I pull the white colour over here and you can see that the bottle becomes visible and for completing the frame here, I just zoom into it."""
And I will paint with white with irregular strokes on the layer mask.
"""To do that, I select the Brush tool, go to the dialog here and I select here a soft brush for painting."""
"""Before painting, I have to de-select my selection by pressing Shift + Ctrl + A and now I can start painting with white."""
White is selected.
"""Now I paint with white here around and you see while I am painting white on the layer mask, I am revealing the image below."""
And the painting is irregular but it's ok.
"""Now, I am selecting a different brush and I think this is better."""
I get a fuzzy corner.
I should zoom into the image 100% so that you can see it.
I get kind of fuzzy border here and I will make it a bit more fuzzy in a moment by painting twice above it.
And now you can see that the border is getting a little bit more irregular.
Perhaps this is not the right tool here but you can use different tools and now I want to sharpen  this image.
You can check out that I am still working in the layer mask.
You can check it here.
"""So, click on Filters, Blur, Gaussian Blur and I select high blur count here and I think that's ok."""
And now I have really fuzzy border here around.
So let's look at the  full image.  Shift + Ctrl + E.
I have the 1st part of my triptych and I do the others in the same way.
I have finished with the other images and you can see here I have over painted over the rulers and I can do that here too.
"""Now I want to remove the rulers and new way of doing that is to go to the Image, Image Guides and here I can remove all guides."""
And I found out that I can do a New Guide  here and select the position numerically.
Its wonderful to have this options.
The GIMP has so many options that you cant remember all of them.
Go to View and de-select Layer Boundary.
I want to have this bottle a bit more up into the corner.
I think there is bit more space here and little bit less here.
"""I think the """"right"""" and the """"center"""" image are here at the right corner."""
But I think this bottle should go up there.
"""So, I will go out of full screen mode,"""
"""I de-select the """"center"""" and the """"right"""" layer and concentrate on the """"left"""" layer."""
Now I need the rulers for guidance.
"""So click on Image, Guides, New Guide and type in Horizontal position 100."""
"""Again go to Image, Guides, New Guide and select vertical position as 100."""
"""And now I select my Move tool. Go to the options, select Move the active layer and I just move this up here."""
"""I think I have made a mistake, so I undo the step by pressing Ctrl + z and here you can see that the mask is selected."""
I want to move the layer.
"""So, now I select the image and I just pull it up and the mask moves with it."""
I found no way to lock the mask but I can correct that.
I select the layer mask and pull the layer mask back to my corner here.
I think this looks better now.
And now this image is finished with the help from Jeson in New York.
"""No, this image isn't finished."""
The thing I normally don't forget but I always forget when I am recording because I have to think about such lot of other things than just making my image.
I have again forgotten to save it.
"""Save it as jaegermeister.xcf, xcf contains all the layer information and i will cut out all the stuff about rescaling for the web."""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Using final keyword.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the final keyword and when to invoke it."""
"""We will also learn about -   final variables , final methods , final classes."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:   Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 , JDK 1.7 , Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have basic knowledge of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
You must have knowledge of Subclassing and Method overriding.
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit our website."""
"""First of all, we will learn what final keyword is."""
final is a keyword or reserved word in Java.
"""It can be applied to variables, methods or classes."""
"""Now, let us learn what final variable is."""
"""final variable is a variable whose value cannot be changed. That is, it will be a constant."""
I am switching to Eclipse IDE now. I had already created a project named MyProject in the previous tutorial.
"""So, we will directly go to the Employee class of the project."""
Come to the variable name.
Add final keyword before the variable name. We have made the variable name as final.
"""We will initialize the variable name with value """"sneha""""."""
We will Save and Run the program.
We get compilation error: The final field Employee.name cannot be assigned
This is because here the final variable 'name' is already declared and initialized.
We can initialize a final variable only once.
"""So, we will comment the method setName which modifies the variable name."""
Save  the class.
"""Now, come to TestEmployee class."""
"""Come to the main method and comment the line manager.setName(""""Nikkita Dinesh"""");"""
We commented this line as it was instance of method setName.
We have already commented setName method in Employee class.
Now let us Save the class and Run the program.
"""Great!!! We got the output,  Name: Sneha  ,Email: abc@gmail.com Manager of: Accounts ."""
We got this output as we already initialized variables with these values in  TestEmployee class and Employee class.
Now come to the final variable name in Employee class.
"""Remove the initialization of final variable name.  That is, remove “sneha”."""
Uncomment the method setName.
Save and Run the program.
We get the error: The final field Employee.name cannot be assigned
"""This is because, if the final variable is not initialized, then only constructor can initialize it."""
"""That is, it cannot be modified anywhere else in the program."""
"""For that, let’s create a constructor in the Employee class.  We have already learnt what a constructor is earlier."""
We know that constructor has the same name as class name.
"""So, we will type:  Employee, parentheses, open and close curly brackets and inside the curly brackets, let's initialize the variable name with value sneha semicolon."""
Comment the method setName.
Save and Run the program.
We got the desired output.
final variable is successfully initialized in a constructor.
Now we will learn about final static variables.
Come to the final variable in Employee class.
Add static keyword before final keyword.  We have made the final variable as static.
Save and Run the program.
We get error: The final field Employee.name cannot be assigned
This is because static final variables cannot be initialized in the constructor.
They must be assigned a value with their declaration. Or they must be declared in a static block.
static variables are shared among all the objects of a class.
Creating a new object would change the static variable.  This is not allowed if the static variable is final.
Switch back to Eclipse IDE.
"""So, now we will create a static block."""
"""For that, in the Employee class, come to the constructor we created."""
"""Here, instead of Employee parenthesis , we will type static.  We have created a static block."""
Now we will Save and Run the program.
We got the desired output. We have successfully initialized static final variable.
Now let’s use final variable as a parameter to the method.
Come to the method setEmail in Employee class.
Add final keyword before String newEmail. We have made the parameter as final.
Save and Run the program.
We got the desired output.
"""Now, come to the method setEmail.  Inside the method, we will type: newEmail is equal to abc@gmail.com semicolon"""
We have modified the final variable newEmail.
Once again we will Save & Run the program.
We get error: The final local variable newEmail cannot be assigned.
This is because final variable as parameter to a method cannot be modified by that method.
"""So, let's remove the variable modification."""
Now we will learn about final method.  Come to the method getDetails in employee class.
Add final keyword before method getDetails. We have made the method as final.
Save and Run the program.
We get error: class Manager overrides final method getDetails().
Come to the method getDetails() in Manager class.
"""This is because if you make any method as final, you cannot override it."""
Manager class method getDetails overrides getDetails method in Employee class.
What if final method is private?
private methods are not inherited by the child class.
"""So, we can add a method getDetails() in the child class. You can try this as an assignment."""
Switch back to Eclipse IDE.
"""In Employee class, remove final keyword before method getDetails."""
Remove static keyword before final variable name.
"""Now, we will learn whether constructor can be declared as final or not."""
"""For that, we will again create a constructor. So, instead of static we will type: Employee parentheses."""
Add final keyword before the constructor.
Save and run the program.
We get error: Illegal modifier for the constructor in type Employee.
"""This is because, constructor cannot be final since constructors cannot  be inherited."""
We will remove the final keyword before the constructor.
"""Now, we will learn about final class."""
Add final keyword before the class Employee to make it final.
We get  error: The method setEmail is undefined for the type Manager.
"""To know the actual error, let's come to TestEmployee class and comment the lines"""
"""manager.setEmail(""""abc@gmail.com""""); manager.setDepartment(""""Accounts"""");"""
Save the class and run the program.
The actual error is The type manager cannot subclass the final class Employee.
"""Here, Manager class extends Employee class."""
"""So, let's come back to Employee class and remove the final keyword. Save the class."""
"""Come to the TestEmployee class. Uncomment the lines manager.setEmail(""""abc@gmail.com""""); manager.setDepartment(""""Accounts"""");"""
Save the class and run the program.
We got the desired output.
"""Now let's summarize. In this tutorial, we learnt:  When to invoke final keyword , What are final variables, final methods and final classes."""
"""As an assignment, Repeat the steps of Using final keyword tutorial for the Bike and Vehicle class which we used in the previous tutorial."""
Write down the classes in Java that are final classes.
Watch the video available at the following link.  It summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Relational Operators in C and C++.
"""Relational operators like,"""
Less than: e.g.  a < b
Greater than: e.g. a > b
Less than or equal to: e.g.  a <= b
Greater than or equal to: e.g. a >= b
Equal to: e.g. a == b
Not equal to: e.g. a != b
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 11.10 as the operating system, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 in Ubuntu."
Let us begin with an introduction.
Relational operators are used to compare integer and floating point numbers.
Expressions using relational operators return 0 for false and 1 for true.
Now I will demonstrate the relational operators with the help of a C program.
I have already made the program.
"""So, I'll open the editor and explain the code."""
"""First, we declare two variables a and b."""
This printf statement prompts the user to enter the values of a and b.
This scanf statement takes input for the variables a and b.
Now we have the greater than (>) operator.
This operator compares the two operands on either side of the operator.
It returns True if a is greater than b.
This printf statement is executed if the above condition is true.
If the above condition is false then it is skipped.
The control then jumps to the next statement.
We now have the less than (<) operator.
This too compares the operands.
It returns true when a is less than b.
This printf statement is executed if the above condition is true.
It is skipped otherwise.
Let's execute the code till here.
First comment out the following.
Type /* (slash asterisk) */  (asterisk slash).
I have saved my file as relational.c.
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""To compile, type the following on the terminal gcc space  relational dot c space -o space rel."""
"""To execute,  type ./rel (dot slash rel). Press Enter."""
I enter a as 8 and b as 3.
The output is displayed: 8 is greater than 3.
You can try executing this code with different values of a and b.
Coming back to  the code.
Delete the comment from here and  put it here.
Now we have the less than or equal to (<=) operator.
This operator compares the two operands on either side of the operator.
It returns true if a is less than or equal to b.
This printf statement is executed if the above condition is true.
If the above condition is false then it is skipped.
The control then jumps to the next statement.
Next comes the greater than or equal to (>=) operator.
It compares a and b and  returns  true if a is greater than or equal to b.
If the condition is true then this printf statement will be executed.
Now let's execute the code till here.
Switch back to the terminal.
Compile and execute as before.
I enter a as 8 and b as 3.
The output is displayed: 8 is greater than or equal to 3
Now  Coming back to rest of the code.
Delete the multiline comments from here and here.
We now have the equal to operator.
It is denoted by double equal signs (==).
This operator returns true when both operands are equal to one another.
This printf statement executes when a is equal to b.
"""If not, the control then jumps on to the next statement."""
"""Similarly, we have the not equal to operator."""
This operator returns true when the operands are not equal to one another.
This printf statement will execute when a is not equal to b.
Coming to the end of the program. return 0;
Compile and execute as before.
Enter a as 8 and b as 3.
The output is displayed on the screen:
8 is not equal to 3
"""So, we see how the relational operators work."""
Try executing this code with different set of inputs.
"""Now, writing a similar program in C++ is quite easy."""
There are a few differences in the syntax.
I have already made the code in C++.
Here  is the code for relational operators in C++.
Notice that the header is different.
Also we have the using statement here.
The output statement in C++ is cout.
And the input statement in C++ is cin.
"""So, apart from these differences, the two codes are very similar."""
Please make sure the file is saved with the extension .cpp.
I have saved my file as relational.cpp.
Let's compile the code.
Open the terminal and type g++ relational.cpp space minus o space rel1
"""To  execute, type  ./rel1 (dot slash rel1), press Enter."""
I enter a as 8 and b as 3.
The output is displayed:
We see that the output is same as  the one in  C program.
Now let us see an error which we can come across.
Come back to the program.
Suppose here we replace the 'double equal to' sign with the 'single equal to'.
Come back to the terminal.
Compile and execute as before.
Here we see it is showing 3 is equal to 3.
Come back to our program.
This is because here we have an assignment operator.
So value of b is assigned to a.
"""Now, let us fix this error."""
Type an equal to sign.
Switch back to  the terminal.
Compile and execute as before.
The output is now correct.
Let's summarize the tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt"""
relational operators like:
Less than:  e.g. a <  b
Greater than: e.g. a>b
Less than or equal to:  e.g. a<=b
Greater than or equal to: e.g. a>=b
Equal to: e.g. a==b
Not equal to: e.g. a!=b
As an assignment: Write a program that takes the marks of three students as input. Compare the marks to see which student has scored the highest. Check also if two or more students have scored equal marks.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of Meet The GIMP.
"""My Name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""In the beginning, I will do something that I always forget to mention."""
I always forget to save the image before doing anything to it.
"""So I go to File, Save as and save this as"""
"""""""comic.xcf""""."""
‘xcf’ is the Gimp native file format and it keeps all the layers information in the file.
"""Never save anything in Gimp as JPEG or 'tif' or so, if you want to work further with it."""
"""You can export from there to every format you want to but for anything you want to do further work with, use 'XCF'."""
"""So, what to do? 1st thing I have to clear up this image a bit."""
"""There are two problems here. First, the guy behind me"""
"""and second is this clutter, below here."""
"""This statue here is very well placed and I think, it is one of the corner points of this image."""
"""So, let me first take away this stuff here."""
So I zoom into the image and select the Pen Tool.
This is best done by Cloning Tool and I don’t have to work very precise here because all this little stuff will vanish in the final image.
So I select the Clone tool and change the size of the Brush.
"""Now, I press Ctrl and click to get a starting point and now I simply start to paint."""
"""But, before starting that I change the Overlay mode to Normal mode, Opacity to 100 and now let’s start painting."""
"""Image gets a little bit cloudy, so I select another brush to paint."""
And now I go here to the border and paint.
"""So, the guy is gone."""
That leaves the clutter here.
I want to keep the flower pot here but this stuff here has to go.
I will take care of this border of the flower pot in a moment.
"""If I would keep this image in this way, you would see the traces of cloning but they will vanish when I switch on the comic mode."""
"""So, now let's do a bit about the flower pot here."""
"""I think, I should clone from this point."""
It doesn't look very convincing in this zoom step but I think it will work.
The comic image basically consists of three parts.
"""First, there are the black patches or dark patches with no colours which give structure to the image."""
Then there are the lines which define forms and items in the image.
And then there is colour and we will start as in the tutorial with the patches.
"""And for that,"""
I double this layer and call it ink.
I select the Threshold tool and click into the image and pull the info. window into the image.
"""You see here, the image is black and white."""
This tool divides the image into black and white.
"""If the pixel is lighter than, at the moment, 82 then the combination of average value of red, green and blue is white."""
And if the level is below 82 it becomes black.
Now we face the first problem here.
"""When I draw this slider around, the effect is very dark."""
"""This value here, 129, would be nice for the left part of my face, the shoulder and for the statue."""
This would be nice for the eyes here
and this for other eye.
Now I have to use different ink layer for this image.
"""So, let's start from the lighter side, like this one here and go back into the image to 100%."""
I double this here and select the Threshold tool and pull this slider down.
But before that I have to make the top layer invisible.
I think this value is good for this part of the face.
I make a copy of this layer and make it visible and now I am working on this layer.
I have to look for the middle terms here.
"""This part of the face, I think this works quite good; so I look around in the image."""
The statue is fine too.
This image has a good definition here and near my hand the line is invisible and that is called optical illusion.
I think this is fine and it should be in the image.
"""Now, I select the Threshold tool, make the line here visible and look at the bright parts to get little bit of definition. So I slide this up."""
This looks better.
Now I have 3 copies of my ink layer.
First is ink light .
Top layer is ink dark.
And let's name the middle layer simply ink.
Now let's look at the 3 layers and decide which one is to use mostly.
I think ink layer is a good base because this is too light and this is too dark.
"""So, I put this layer in the bottom and I add a layer mask to the dark layer and the light layer."""
I add a layer mask in black which is fully transparent.
"""So, everything here gets invisible."""
"""When I draw white on this layer mask of the light layer, the image will be revealed in it."""
"""So, I select the Brush tool here with Normal mode and Opacity 100%."""
"""I think, I shall use a hard brush and the Pressure sensitivity should be the Size. So, when I press the brush on the surface, the dot will be  larger."""
My foreground colour is white.
So let's start.
I think the left part of the face should be brightened.
I press 1 to zoom into the image.
"""I think this brush is too small,  so I scale this a bit up."""
That looks better.
But perhaps it is too bright.
This has to be either black or white.
"""So, I switch the colours with ‘X’ key and paint this over again, here."""
"""But I think, I can leave this out here and put the next layer above that."""
"""Now, we are more concerned about the areas and about the structure. So, I should forget about the lines and just look at the structure here."""
Simply leave it as it is.
I can add another layer easily and now I paint for the dark parts with the white colour.
Let's see if I can reveal here a little bit.
I think this is too much.
I want to make the face a bit darker.
And here also.
I think that is too dark.
"""Here, there is some work still to be done but I will leave it to this here and look at it after I am done with the next step with the lines and then I can adjust here."""
This has to be brightened up.
"""So, we will look at the edit there."""
"""In this step, I have to add some lines and this can be done by doubling the Background layer and putting it on top and naming it lines."""
The lines are the edges between different colours.
"""So, I go to Filters, then we have Edge-detect and here I have Difference of Gaussian Edge Detect."""
"""The relevant slider is the Radius and if you decrease the number, the lines get finer."""
"""If you increase the number, the lines get wider and you get more of the details in the image."""
I would prefer something around 10 but I can go to 30 and then decide where exactly I should stop.
"""When I go to 30, I don't get the edges but areas and 12 would give this here."""
And I think I will settle at 10.
I set the Layer mode of this layer to Multiply and for the colour rising I will later need to reduce the white in the image.
Now let's checkout if we have got this right up to now.
"""So, I will switch the lines layer on and off and you see here there is some definition when the lines layer is on."""
And now I de-select the dark ink layer and keep the light ink layer.
The structure that I wanted to have in with my dark ink layer is visible in the lines layer.
"""So, I will leave the dark ink layer switched off."""
I don't think there is a need to combine these layers here.
I will leave it as it is so that I can change something and it will be in the final image.
"""Next step, as I said, I have to reduce the White channel here and it can be done with the Levels tool and I reduce the level up to 240."""
"""When I switch off this layer, you can see that I have a gray background and little bit of colour information in here."""
"""For getting the colour in the image, I copy the Background layer and name it colour and put it on the top and set the layer mode to Colour."""
"""But it doesn't look good, so I should change the mode."""
The image has got little bit of colour in here.
"""But I want more saturation, so again I make the copy of Background layer and name it saturation."""
I set the layer mode to Saturation.
I think this Saturation mode already works and the effects are very good.
There should have been more flatness in the colour and the hand is not looking comic.
I will look where this comes from.
"""So, I can now start to play with these sliders."""
"""Going down with Saturation gets little bit flatter and looks more like water colours. So, this is a strange effect."""
Now I can start to play with the layers here.
"""So, I switch off the lines layer and you see here that this is not the effect from the lines but from colour and saturation."""
Now I can make some adjustments because I still have the layers here.
"""I want to lighten the face, so I select my ink light layer, select a brush with white foreground colour."""
I zoom into the image.
"""Reduce the size of the brush and scale it a bit and now I start to paint the eye, here."""
That's too much.
Now I paint in this part.
This is too much.
"""You can imagine, there can be lot of modifications in here you can make in the image by changing these areas here."""
This is OK.
You can do a lot of changes here and I don't know if I am on the right track.
But I like it up to now.
Let’s see what else we can do.
"""First thing is, we can use a different layer than the lines."""
"""So, I switch off the lines and I get very strange colours because now I have again a white background."""
So add another layer here and set it to white and use Multiply mode and fill it with 240 grey.
Now I have got nearly the same image as with my lines here.
Let me switch them on.
I have the lines information coming out but this comic effect is still there and I can look what’s better.
Let's try some different tricks.
I double the colour and the saturation layers and do something with them.
"""Here, I just try to get the details out of the image."""
"""So, go to Filters >> Blur and Gaussian Blur."""
"""And here, I choose a value which gives me a nice effect."""
You see that the colours have got little bit smoother.
"""So, let's do this on the saturation copy also."""
"""Go to Filters >> Repeat """"Guassian Blur"""" ."""
And now I have really flat image with flat colours.
"""So, I switch on the original colour and I get a strange effect here."""
Let's rename these layers as saturation blurred and the colour blurred.
"""If I combine the blurred saturation with the unblurred colour, I get some colours here which look quite a bit strange."""
"""I would like it if it was not especially on the nose, here."""
"""So, switching this back on and I have this effect here."""
"""You can imagine if you reduce the blurring, you get sharp details."""
This is a real play ground.
"""You have a lot of possibilities here like how to do this, what to do, what to tinker with."""
It's really fun to do this.
The author of the original tutorial has done a tremendous job.
I am not so happy with both versions of this image.
"""I like the structure here and the flower, the statue and the pot here."""
"""I don’t like all the details near the hand and in the face, this could be little bit more flat."""
"""In the blurred on, I like the details in the face and near the hand but I don’t like the flower which is completely blurred away."""
"""So, now I can combine the two images and I will start with colour blurred because I like the over all appearance of this more than of the saturation blurred."""
"""But I switch on all the layers and add layer mask to saturation blurred and colour blurred and I add a Black layer mask, fully transparent."""
"""And now I'll start working on saturation layer mask. So, I select white as my foreground colour and select the Paintbrush here."""
Now I start painting.
I just paint over the parts where I want to have little bit more flatness in the image.
This will look a bit strange because now I have the colour layer switched on.
"""So now, I select everything by pressing Shift+ctrl+A and copy it by Ctrl + C, go into the image and press Ctrl + V and click on insert this Floating Selection and with Ctrl + H or with the anchor layer I hav"
"""So, you can copy these layer masks too and I think I will leave this image here."""
I think it’s so quite nice example and in the end I play a bit with these sliders.
Lets recap this.
You first copy the image layer and make  an inked  image with threshold tool.
Look for areas which you want to have black or very dark.
Then you copy the base image again and make a line layer with the edge detect filter and then you set the layer mode to Multiply.
"""In this layer, you reduce the white to a gray about 240 with the Levels tool."""
Then you copy again the base image and make a colour layer.
Set the colour mode to Colour.
And finally you copy the base layer last time and make a saturation layer and here you set the layer mode to Saturation and now you play with the opacity of the different layers or at some layers.
Just play around. The results are well mixed but some are stunning.

"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Hi everybody.Welcome to the  tutorial on introduction to Developing Web Applications on the Netbeans IDE.
We assume that you have the basic working knowledge of Netbeans.
"""If not, please visit the Spoken Tutorial website for relevant tutorials on Netbeans."""
"""Having viewed the first tutorial, you would already be familiar"""
with the installation and interface of Netbeans.
The previous tutorial also teaches you how to create a new project.
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System Ubuntu version 11.04 and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1."""
This tutorial will take you through the basics of using Netbeans  to develop web applications.
We will see - Setting up a web-application project
Creating and editing web-applications source files
Creating a java package and a java source file
Generating the Getter and Setter methods
Editing the default Java Server Pages file
Creating a JavaServer pages file and
finally running our web-application project.
"""To follow this tutorial, you will need: * the Netbeans IDE"""
The Java Development Kit (JDK) version 6
The GlassFish Server Open Source Edition.
All the above can be downloaded in a single bundle from the link shown on the screen.
"""This tutorial demonstrates how to create a simple web application,"""
"""deploy it to a server,"""
and view its presentation in a browser.
"""The application employs (JSP)  Java Server Pages, to ask you, to input your name."""
It then uses JavaBeans component to persist the name during the HTTP session
and then retrieves the  output on a second JSP page.
Let us now move to Netbeans and create our web-application project.
"""From the File menu, choose New Project."""
"""Under Categories, select Java Web."""
"""Under Projects, select Web Application and click Next."""
"""Give your project a name. I will name my project as """"HelloWeb""""."""
Specify the Project Location to any directory on your computer.
Click Next.
The Server and Settings panel opens.
Select the version of Java you want to use with your application.
"""And, select the server, you want to deploy your application to."""
"""In the Frameworks panel,"""
click Finish to create the project.
The IDE creates the HelloWeb project folder.
This folder contains all of your sources and project metadata.
"""The welcome page- index.jsp, opens in the Source Editor in the main window."""
"""You can view the project's file structure in the Files window on the left, here,"""
and it's logical structure in the Projects window.
Creating and editing source files is the most important function that the IDE serves.
"""Now in the Projects window, expand the Source Packages node."""
"""Note that the Source Packages node contains only  an empty """"default package"""" node."""
Right-click on the Source Packages  and choose New > Java Class.
"""Give your class a name. I will name the class as """"NameHandler"""""""
"""and in the Package combo-box, let me type: """"org.mypackage.hello"""""""
and click Finish.
The NameHandler.java file opens in the Source editor.
"""Now, let's declare a String variable directly below the class declaration."""
I will declare a string variable 'String name' and
I will also add a constructor public NameHandler() to the class.
"""Now, let me also  add name = null; within the constructor."""
Let us next generate the Getter and Setter Methods.
"""Right-click the name field in the Source Editor, choose Refactor  and  Encapsulate Fields  from the contextual menu."""
"""Refactoring is a disciplined technique for improving the structure of the existing code, without changing the observable behavior."""
"""In short, you can change the structure of the code without changing the behavior."""
"""With Refactoring, you can easily move fields, methods or classes around, without breaking things."""
Let's move back to the IDE.
"""The Encapsulate Fields dialog-box opens, listing the name field."""
"""Notice that the Fields Visibility is  set to """"private"""""""
"""and the Accessors Visibility is set to """"public"""", by default,"""
indicating that the access modifier for the class variables will be specified as private
whereas the getter and setter methods will be generated with 'public' modifiers respectively.
Click on Refactor.
The Getter and Setter methods are generated for the name field.
"""The modifier for the class variable is set to """"private"""" whereas the  getter and setter methods are generated with """"public"""" modifier."""
Your java class should finally look like this.
Let us next edit the Default JavaServer Pages File.
"""Let us refocus the 'index.jsp' file by clicking its tab, displayed at the top of the Source editor."""
"""Now, let us open the Palette manager by going to the Tools menu > Palette and click on HTML/JSP code clips."""
The Palette manager opens.
"""In the palette manager, expand the HTML Forms option."""
Select the Form item.
"""Drag it and drop it to a point after the h1 tags, in your Source Editor."""
The Insert Form dialog-box opens.
Let us specify the values as being shown on the screen:
"""the Action as  """"response.jsp"""","""
"""the Method as """"GET""""."""
"""And, let's  give our form a name as """"Name Input Form""""."""
Click OK.
An HTML form is added to the 'index.jsp' file.
"""Now, from the Palette manager, select a Text Input item, drag it and drop it to a point just before the closing form tags."""
"""In the Insert Text Input dialog-box, specify the Name as """"name""""."""
Leave the Type at text
and click on OK.
A HTML input tag is now added between the form tags.
Let us delete the empty 'value' attribute from the input tag.
"""Now, from the palette, select the Button item."""
"""Drag it and drop it to the point, before the closing form tag."""
"""Specify the Label as """"OK"""","""
"""the Type as """"submit"""""""
and click on OK again.
An HTML button is now added to a  form tags.
"""Infront of the first input tag, let us enter the text """"Enter your name""""."""
"""And, let us  change the default text between the h1  tags."""
"""We will change the text to """"Entry form""""."""
"""Now, right-click. Let me close the palette manager, for now."""
Right-click within your Source Editor.
Select the Format option to tidy the format of your code.
Your 'index.jsp' file should now look like this.
Let us next create a JavaServer Pages file.
"""In the Projects window, right-click on the HelloWeb project node, choose New > JSP."""
The New JSP file wizard opens.
"""Name the file as """"response"""" and click on Finish."""
"""Notice that a 'response.jsp' file node displays in the Projects window, beneath the index.jsp file"""
and the new file opens in the Source Editor.
Open the Palette manager again.
"""Now, expand the JSP option."""
"""Select a Use Bean item, drag it and drop it to a point just below the body tag."""
The Insert Use Bean dialog opens.
Specify the values as-
"""the ID as mybean,"""
"""the Class as """"org.mypackage.hello.NameHandler""""."""
Set the Scope as session
and click on OK.
Notice that a jsp:useBean tag is added beneath the body tag.
JavaBeans are reusable software components for Java.
They are used to encapsulate many objects into a single object
so that they can be passed around as a single bean object instead of multiple individual objects.
"""Now, from the Palette manager, select a Set Bean property item, drag it and drop it  to a point just before the h1 tags"""
"""Here, in the jsp:setProperty tag that appears, delete the empty """"value"""" attribute"""
"""and set the name attribute to """"mybean"""" and the Property to """"name""""."""
"""Now, in between the h1 tags, let us change the text to Hello comma space and an exclamation mark."""
"""Now, from the Palette manager, select a Get Bean property  item. Drag it and drop it after the """"Hello"""" text  in between the h1 tags."""
"""In the Get Bean Property item,"""
"""set the Bean Name to """"mybean"""""""
"""and the Property Name to """"name""""."""
Click on OK.
Notice that jsp:getProperty tag is now added between the h1 tags.
"""Right-click within the Source Editor again. Click on  Format to tidy the format of your code, if required."""
The next step is to run our Web Application Project.
Let me close the Palette manager.
"""In the Projects window, right-click the """"HelloWeb"""" project node and choose the Run option."""
You can also click the Run option from the toolbar or press F6 key on your keyboard to run your Project.
I will select the button on the toolbar to run my Project.
"""When you run a Web application, the IDE builds and compiles the application code,"""
launches the server and deploys the application to the server
and finally displays the application in a browser window.
"""To view these processes, you can open the output window from the Window menu and select the Output option."""
You can see that your application has been  built successfully.
The 'index.jsp' page opens in your default browser.
Let me run the project again.
Here it is! It opens in your default browser.
Note that the browser window may sometimes open before the IDE displays the server output.
"""Now, let us enter the name in the text-box, in the browser."""
For e.g. Ubuntu and click on OK.
"""The 'response.jsp' page displays, providing you with a simple greeting."""
"""Now, to the assignment part-"""
"""As an extension to the web-application project, insert two more text fields, that is, totally three input text fields in your application."""
Use the JavaBeans component to set the bean property and
view its presentation in the browser.
"""And finally, retrieve the output on the second JSP page."""
I have already constructed my assignment.
Let me open my assignment and run it in the  IDE.
I am presented with 3 input text fields.
Let me enter the details and click on OK.
I should be presented with an output like this.
"""If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch the videos."""

"""In this tutorial, we will learn to-  add and delete atoms,"""
"""add and delete bonds,"""
"""rotate bonds,"""
"""change length of the bond,"""
"""change hydrogen to methyl group,"""
"""copy, paste and join structures."""
"""Here I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS version. 14.04, Avogadro version 1.1.1."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with:  Avogadro  interface."""
Here I will show how to open Avogadro  using the Terminal.
"""To open the terminal, press CTRL, ALT and T keys simultaneously."""
Type avogadro at the prompt and press Enter.
Avogadro application window opens.
"""For demonstration, I will display a molecule of n-butane from the Fragment library."""
Click on Build menu. Navigate to Insert->Fragment
Insert fragment dialog box appears.
"""From the list of fragments, double click on alkanes folder to open."""
Select butane.cml from the drop down that appears.
Click on Insert button. Click on X to close Insert Fragment dialog box.
"""Butane molecule, highlighted in blue color, appears on the Panel."""
"""To remove the highlighting, Press Ctrl, Shift and A keys simultaneously."""
Rotate the structure using Navigation tool to get proper alignment.
We will now learn how to add atoms to the molecule.
Click on Draw tool icon on the tool bar.
Click on end Carbon atom and drag on the Panel.
A carbon atom with required hydrogens get added.
We now have a molecule of pentane on Panel.
"""Similarly, you can add atoms using Draw tool to make a series of alkanes."""
Open a new window. Draw propane using Draw tool.
Let us delete the end Carbon atom with hydrogens to get a molecule of Ethane.
"""To delete atoms, click on the Selection tool icon on the tool bar."""
Click and drag over the end Carbon atom to make the selection.
Selected atoms appear blue in color.
"""Press Backspace to delete. Alternatively, you can use clear option in Edit menu."""
"""To redo, press Ctrl and Z keys simultaneously."""
We will demonstrate on how to add and delete bonds in a molecule.
"""To add bonds, select the Draw tool icon on the tool bar."""
Draw Settings menu opens on the left.
"""By default, Carbon is selected in the Element drop down list."""
"""To introduce a double bond, select Double from Bond Order drop down."""
Click on the bond between C-1 and C-2 to convert it to a double bond.
"""To convert double bond into a triple bond, select Triple from Bond Order. Click on the bond."""
"""To delete bonds, hold the right mouse button and click on the bonds."""
This results in two different molecules.
Let's rejoin the molecules.
"""Click on Carbon of one molecule, drag and click on carbon of other molecule."""
We can rotate bonds and change bond lengths using Bond Centric Manipulation tool.
Click on Bond Centric Manipulation tool on the tool bar.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on How to close a Budget.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn the steps involved in closing a Budget."""
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04 and Koha version 16.05."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of Library Science."""
"""To practice this tutorial, you should have Koha installed on your system."""
"""And, you should have Admin access in Koha."""
Please refer to the Koha Spoken Tutorial series on this website for more details.
Let’s learn how to close a Budget.
"""Before we start, please note: closing of a Budget is done to move the un-received orders and"""
the required unspent funds
from an old Budget to a new Budget.
From the previous Budget i.e. Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I
to a new Budget i.e. Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018 Phase II
"""Please note- Before closing a Budget, it is advisable to duplicate the immediate previous year's Budget."""
"""To do so, the same fund structures of the previous Budget must exist in the new Budget."""
"""For closing a Budget, do the following: Login with the Superlibrarian username and password."""
"""On the Koha Home page, click on Acquisitions."""
"""From the options on the left side, click on Budgets."""
"""On Budgets administration page, under the tab Active Budgets, locate the respective Budget."""
"""In my case, Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I."""
"""Click on the tab Actions and from the drop-down, select the option 'Close'."""
"""When 'Close' is selected, a new page opens up."""
It says - The unreceived orders from the following funds will be moved.
"""On the same page, we have Select a Budget."""
"""From the drop-down, select the Budget wherein you want to move your unreceived orders."""
I will select Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018 Phase II. The same Fund details need to be created in the Duplicate Budget.
This will enable us to move the unspent Budget there.
Next is 'Move remaining unspent funds'.
Clicking on this will move the unspent amounts to the new Budget.
Do so if you wish to add the unspent amount of the immediate previous year to the new Budget. I will leave this box blank.
"""After all details are filled, click on Move unreceived orders button at the bottom of the page."""
A dialog-box appears with the following message:
"""You have chosen to move all unreceived orders from 'Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I' to 'Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018, Phase II'."""
This action cannot be reversed. Do you wish to continue?.
"""It is important to remember that once completed, you cannot undo this process."""
Click on OK under the dialog-box.
A new page opens. Report after moving unreceived orders from Budget Spoken Tutorial Library 2016-2017 Phase I (01/04/2016 - 31/03/2017) to Spoken Tutorial Library 2017-2018 Phase II (01/04/2017 - 31/03/2018).
This page will display the Order numbers with details having Moved.
"""With this, we have closed the financial year's Budget."""
"""And, we can now move on to create the next year's Budget."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on do-while Loop in java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn about: do-while loop and how to use it"""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10 JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have knowledge of while loop in java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website as shown."""
Here is the structure for  do-while loop.
Notice that it is similar to a while loop.
It has two parts.
First is the loop running condition. And the second is the loop variable.
The only difference is that the condition is written after the do block.
"""And so, the condition is checked after the execution of the statements inside the do block."""
"""Now, let us see an example."""
Switch to eclipse.
Here we have Eclipse IDE and the skeleton required for the rest of the code.
We have created a class DoWhileDemo and added the main method to it.
We are going to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a do-while loop.
Type:
int n equal to 1;.
'n' is going to be the loop variable.
Then type: do
open   and close  braces
Inside the braces System.out.println(n);
We shall print the value of 'n' and then increment it. n equal to  n plus 1;
And we do this as long as
n is less than or equal to 10.
"""So, outside the braces, type: while in parentheses n less than or equal to 10."""
and close the do-while using a semicolon.
Let us see the code in action.
Save and Run.
We see that the numbers from 1 to 10 are printed.
"""Now, let us understand how the code is executed."""
"""First, the value 1 is printed and then 'n' becomes 2."""
"""And then, the condition is checked."""
"""since it is true, again 2 is printed and 'n' becomes 3."""
And so on till all the 10 numbers are printed and the value of 'n' becomes 11.
"""When n = 11, the condition fails and the loop stops."""
"""Now, let us print numbers from 50 to 40 in decreasing order."""
"""So, we start with 50."""
"""So, change n = 1 to n = 50."""
"""Since we are looping from a bigger number to a smaller number, we decrement the loop variable."""
"""So, change n = n + 1 to n = n - 1."""
We loop as long as 'n' is greater than or equal to 40.
"""So, change the condition to n >= 40."""
Let us look at the output.
Save and Run.
"""As we can see, the numbers from 50 to 40 are printed."""
Now let us try a different logic using the do-while loop.
"""Given a number, we shall find out if it is a perfect square or not."""
First clear the main method.
"""Then, type int n = 25;"""
We shall see if the value in 'n' is a perfect square or not.
Then type int x = 0;
We shall use 'x' to store the square root of the number if it is a perfect square.
Then type do
Open and close braces.
"""Inside the braces, x equal to x  plus  1;"""
and outside the braces
while in parentheses x into x is less than n
And close the do-while using a semi-colon.
"""As long as x into x is less than n, we keep incrementing the value of 'x'."""
"""So, when the loop stops the reverse of this condition will be true."""
"""Which means, either 'x into x' must be equal to 'n'"""
or it  must be greater than 'n'.
"""If x into x is equal to n, the number is a perfect square."""
"""If it is not equal to 'n', the number is not a perfect square."""
"""So finally, we print the condition."""
System.out.println (x * x == n);
Let us see the code in action.
"""Save and Run.  As we can see, the output is true."""
Let us try with another perfect square.
Change n = 25 to n = 49.
We see that we get a true again .
Let us try with a number which is not a perfect square.
Change 49 to 23. Save and Run and
we get a false as expected.
"""Now, let us see what happens when the value of 'n' is 0."""
"""Change n = 23 to n = 0. Since 0 is not a natural number, we must get a false."""
Let us run the code.
We see that we get false as expected.
This happens because even before the condition
"""x into x is less than n  is checked, the value of 'x' is incremented and it becomes 1."""
The loop condition fails and the loop does not run.
"""This way, by using a do-while loop, we make sure that 0 is not considered as a perfect square."""
"""This way, a do-while loop is used for solving a range of problems."""
"""Specially, when the loop must run at least once."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about"""
the do-while loop and how to use it.
"""As an assignment for this tutorial, solve the following problem."""
"""Given a binary number, find out its decimal equivalent. Example: 11010 => 26"""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Setting Pop-up and Image options in Mozilla Firefox.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn: * How to set Pop-up and image preferences."""
Customize Toolbar.
Pop-up windows or pop-ups are windows that appear automatically without your permission.
They vary in size but usually don't cover the whole screen.
Some pop-ups open on top of the current Firefox window while others appear underneath Firefox (pop-unders).
Pop-ups can be quite irritating and that’s why we want to disable them.
"""In this tutorial, we are using Firefox version 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04."""
Let us open a Firefox browser.
"""In the URL bar, let us type ‘w w w dot pop up test dot com’."""
Press the Enter key.
This site shows you what a pop-up is.
Click on the link that says ‘Multi-PopUp Test’.
You will see 6 pop-ups.
Click on Back.
2 more pop-ups appear. See how irritating they are?
Firefox allows you to control both pop-ups and pop-unders.  This is done by clicking on Edit and then Preferences.
"""Windows users, please click on Tools and then on Options."""
"""In the Preferences window, click on the Content tab."""
"""The Block pop-up windows option is already turned on, by default."""
"""If not, then you need to check it."""
"""So, you don't have to worry about enabling it to prevent pop-ups from appearing in Firefox."""
Now you can close the Firefox Preference window by clicking on the Close button.
You can also choose exceptions.
Exceptions are sites whose pop-ups are acceptable to you.
Click on Edit and then Preferences.
"""Windows users, please click on Tools and then on Options."""
"""In order to add exceptions, click on the Exceptions button next to the field Block pop-up windows."""
This opens up a dialog box.
"""In the Address of website field, type: ‘w w w dot google dot com’."""
Click on the Allow button.
Click Close to close the dialog box.
Click Close to close the Preferences dialog box.
Now pop-ups will be disallowed from all sites except from 'google.com'.
"""Now in the URL bar, type: ‘w w w dot pop up test dot com’ and press Enter."""
Click on the link 'Multi-PopUp Test'.
Not a single pop-up has appeared.
Your pop-up blocker is effective!
Images take time and bandwidth to download.
Mozilla Firefox has an option to selectively stop the downloading of images.
Click on Edit and then Preferences.
"""In the Preferences dialog box, choose the Content tab."""
Disable the check-box for Load images automatically.
Click on Close to close the dialog box.
"""Now, in the Search bar, let us type """"Flowers"""" and press the Enter key."""
"""From the 'google' home page, click on Images."""
click on the first image link that appears.
You see that the image does not load.
Mozilla Firefox offers a number of options to customize the toolbars.
"""Let’s say we want to hide any toolbar. For example, the Menu bar."""
Right-click on an empty section of the Menu bar.
And uncheck it. That's it!
To view the the Menu bar again right-click on an empty section of the toolbar again.
Now check the Menu bar option.
Firefox offers advanced options to customize the toolbars. Let's look at some.
Let us add an icon to the Toolbar which will allow us to print a web-page with a single click.
Right-click on an empty section of the Toolbar.
Click on Customize.
The Customize Toolbar dialog box appears.
"""Within the dialog box, you can see the Print icon."""
Drag the icon onto the Toolbar.
Close the dialog box by clicking on Done.
Click on the Print icon in the Toolbar.
This brings up the Print dialog box.
We will not be printing now.
"""So, click on Cancel to close the dialog box."""
You can also add or remove toolbars.
"""To do so, right-click on the Toolbar and select Customize."""
Click on Add New Toolbar button.
Enter a name for the new toolbar. Let’s name it Sample Toolbar.
Click on OK button.
"""Now drag and drop an icon, say Downloads, onto the Sample Toolbar."""
Notice the new Toolbar in the browser.
"""To remove a toolbar, click on Restore Default Set button."""
"""In order to maximize the contents area, we can reduce the size of the icons."""
"""Check on the check-box titled """"Use Small icons""""."""
Click Done to close the dialog box.
We see that the size of the icons has become smaller.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt how to: Set Pop-up and Image preferences."""
Customize Toolbar.
Here is an assignment for you.
Open a new Mozilla Firefox window. Block all the pop-ups except those from 'www.yahoo.com'. Insert a bookmarks toolbar.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Users in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn how to: add a user, edit a user’s profile, upload users in bulk."""
"""This tutorial is recorded using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04, Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30 Moodle 3.3  and  Firefox web browser.  You can use any web browser of your choice."""
"""Learners of this tutorial should have some courses created on their Moodle website. If not, please refer to the previous Moodle tutorials on this website."""
"""Switch to the browser and login to your Moodle website, using your admin username and password."""
"""Now, we will learn how to create a new user in Moodle."""
"""In the Navigation block, click on Site Administration and then on the Users tab."""
Click on Add a new user option.
I will enter the username as adminuser2.
Scroll down to the New Password field. Click on the link Click to enter text.
Please note- the password must follow the rules as shown here.
I will enter Spokentutorial1@ as my password.
Click on the checkbox Force password change.
This forces the new user to change his/her password when he/she logs in for the first time.
Enter rest of the details as per your preference as shown here.
"""In the Email display, note that I have selected Allow everyone to see my email address. This is because I am going to make this user as an admin user later."""
But this is best avoided for other users like teachers and students.
We will leave the City/Town field as blank for now.  We will update this later when we edit this user.
Then select country and timezone as shown here.
Let all the remaining fields be set to default.
Then scroll down and click on Create user button.
We now have 2 users. Click on the System Admin2 user which we created just now.
We can edit this user’s profile by clicking on the Edit Profile link on the right. Let us enter Mumbai in the City/Town text-box.
"""Then scroll down and click Update profile button. Likewise, we can edit any detail for any user."""
Look at the 3 icons to the right of this new user. Hover over them to see what each of them does.
"""The delete icon will delete the user. Please note: Deleting a user will delete all the user data, including his/ her course registrations, grades etc.  So, this option should be used with extreme caution."""
The eye icon will suspend the user. Suspending a user would mean deactivating his/her account.
"""So, the user will no longer be able to login, but his/ her registrations, grades, etc. are all kept intact."""
This is a better thing to do rather than deleting the user.
It saves the records for future purposes and you can activate the user back whenever you want to.
Next is the gear icon. This will take us to the Edit profile page.
Note that delete and suspend icons are not shown next to the Admin User.
This is because the main system administrator can never be deleted or deactivated.
"""Now, let us learn to add users in bulk, that is, in one go."""
"""For this, we have to upload a file with certain data in a particular format. The accepted file type is CSV."""
I’ll open the user-details-upoad.csv file which I have already created for demonstration.
I’m using LibreOffice Calc which is the spreadsheet component of LibreOffice Suite.
"""This file has the following columns: username, password, firstname, lastname, email. These 5 fields are mandatory fields."""
"""There are some more fields here which are optional: institution, department, phone1, address, course1, role1."""
Note that the field titles have to be exactly as written in this spreadsheet i.e. in lowercase. Otherwise the upload will throw an error.
"""If we have only one course in which to enroll the user, we will suffix 1 in the fields title."""
"""If there are more courses you want to enroll the users to, add more columns with course2, role2, etc."""
Please note: you should input Course short name in the course1 field and Role short name in the role1 field.
The Role short name for a student is student and for a teacher is editingteacher.
"""We will have 3 users in this CSV file: System Admin2 user which has already been created manually, one user with only 5 mandatory fields to show that other fields are optional and  one user with all details."
This CSV file is available in the Code files section of this tutorial.  You can download and use it.
The Additional Reading Material of this tutorial has more information about the CSV file creation.
Now let’s go back to the browser window.
Click on Site Administration in the Navigation block.
"""Then click on the Users tab. In the Accounts section, click on Upload Users."""
Click on Choose a file button. A new pop-up window opens with the title File picker.
"""Click on Upload a file link in the left menu, if the pop-up window is not on that link already."""
Click on Browse / Choose a file button whichever appears on your interface. Browse to the saved folder and select the CSV file.
We will let all the other fields remain as default.
"""At the bottom of the page, click on Upload this file button."""
The same screen refreshes with the filename now written in the text area.
The button at the bottom has now changed to Upload users. Click on this Upload users button.
The next page shows a preview of the users that we are uploading.  Verify that the values are correct. Check the Settings section now.
The Upload type drop-down has 4 options.
"""These 3 options can be used to update the records of existing users. We will select Add new only, skip existing users."""
"""This means that if a username is already existing, it will not be added."""
"""In the New user password drop-down, select Field required in file."""
"""Under Force password change, select All. This will prompt all users to change their passwords when they login for the first time."""
We will let the other fields in this section remain default.
Let us look at the Default values section now.
"""Under Email display, select Allow only other course members to see my email address."""
"""You can input the default fields, if they are same for all users. These fields will be used for all uploaded users."""
I will type Mumbai in City/Town.
"""Next, click on Show more… There are more fields that we can enter data into."""
"""But notice that none of them are mandatory. So, I will let these remain blank for now."""
"""At the bottom of the page, click on Upload users button."""
Look at the status column of the Upload users results table displayed here.
"""For the 1st user, the status message is: User not added - already registered."""
"""This user already exists in the system, so it was skipped."""
Rest of the users have been added as New users.
Look at the status displayed here.
Weak passwords are the ones that do not follow password rules.
"""Though these will be uploaded in the system, it is always preferable to have strong passwords."""
Click on Continue button. Let us view all the users that we created.
"""Click on Site Administration. Then click on the Users tab. Under the Accounts section, click on Browse list of users."""
We now have 4 users.
"""With this, we come to the end of the tutorial. Let us summarize."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to: add a user, edit a user’s profile, upload users in bulk."""
"""The Spoken Tutorial team conducts workshops and gives certificates. For more details, please write to us."""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on First C++ program.
"""In this tutorial I am going to explain,"""
How to write a C++ program
"""How to compile it, How to execute it"""
We will also explain some common errors and their solution.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10 and"""
G++ Compiler version 4.5.2 on Ubuntu.
You should be familiar with Ubuntu Operating System and an Editor
Some editors are 'vim' and 'gedit'.
I am using 'gedit' in this tutorial.
For relevant tutorial please visit our website which is as shown.
Let me tell you how to write a C++ program through an example.
"""Open the  terminal Window using Ctrl,  Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
"""To open the text editor, type on the terminal."""
“gedit” space “talk” dot “.cpp” space ampersand “&” sign.
We use the “&” to free up the prompt.
Please note that all the C++ files will have the extension “.cpp”.
"""Now   Press Enter,"""
Let us start to write a program.
Type double slash “//” space “My first C++ program”.
"""Here, double slash is used to comment the line."""
Comments are used to understand the flow of program.
It is useful for documentation.
It gives us information about the program.
The double slash is called as single line comment. Now press Enter.
"""Type (hash) “#include”, space, opening angle bracket, closing angle bracket ."""
"""It is  a good practice to complete the brackets first, and then start writing inside it."""
"""Now Inside the bracket, type “iostream” ."""
Here iostream is a header file.
This file includes the declaration of  standard input output functions  in C++. Now press Enter.
Type “using” space “namespace” space “std” and a semicolon “;” .
The using statement informs the compiler that you want to use the std namespace.
The purpose of namespace is to avoid name collisions.
It is done by localizing the names of identifiers.
It creates a declarative region and defines a scope.
Anything defined within a namespace is in the SCOPE of that namespace.
Here std is the namespace in which entire standard C++ library is declared. Now press Enter.
"""Type “int” space “main” opening bracket, closing bracket ."""
main is a special function.
It denotes that the execution of the program begins from this line.
The opening and the closing bracket is called as Parenthesis.
Parenthesis followed by main  tells the user that main is a function.
"""Here, the int main()  function takes no arguments and returns a value of type integer."""
We will learn about data types in another tutorial.
Now  let us switch to the slides to know more about  main function.
Every program should have  one main function.
There should NOT be more than one “main” function.
Otherwise the compiler cannot locate the beginning of the program.
The empty pair of parentheses indicates that main has no arguments.
The concept of arguments will be discussed in  the upcoming tutorials.
Now come back to our program. Press Enter.
Type opening curly bracket “{”.
The opening  curly  bracket marks the beginning of the function main().
Then Type closing curly bracket “}”.
The closing bracket indicates the end of the function main().
"""Now, inside the bracket press enter twice."""
Move the cursor one line up.
Indentation makes the code easier to read.
It also helps to locate errors faster.
So let us  give a  space here.
And type “cout” space two opening angle bracket '.
Here cout is a standard C++ function to print the output on the terminal.
"""Now  after the brackets, type within  double quotes."""
"""Anything within the double quotes, in the cout  functions, will be printed."""
Now inside a quote type“Talk to a teacher backslash n” ().
Here  signifies newline.
"""As a result, after execution of the cout function, the cursor moves to the new line."""
Every C++ statement must end with a semicolon.
Hence type it at the end of this line.
Semicolon acts as a statement terminator. Now press Enter.
Give a space here and  Type “return” space “0” and a semicolon “;”.
This statement returns the integer zero.
An integer has to be returned for this function because the function type is int.
The return statement marks the end of executable statements.
We will learn more about the returned values in another tutorial.
Now click on “Save” button to save the file.
It is a good habit to save files frequently.
This will protect you from sudden power failures.
It will also be useful in case the applications were to crash.
Let us now compile the program.
Come back to our  terminal.
Type “g++” space “talk.cpp” space hyphen “-o” space “output”.
Here g++ is the compiler used to compile C++ programs.
talk.cpp is our filename.
"""hyphen -o output says that the executable should go to the file """"output""""."""
We see that the program is compiled.
"""By typing ls space hyphen lrt, we can see that output is the last file to be created."""
"""Let us  execute a  program,  type  “./output” (dot slash output)."""
And  Press Enter.
Here the output is displayed as “Talk to a teacher”.
Now let us see the common errors which we can come across.
Switch  back to  our text editor.
Suppose here we miss the }(closing curly bracket)
now save the file.
Let us execute. Come back to our  terminal.
Now compile and run the program using the command we used before. We see an error.
"""We see that there is an error at line no.7 in our talk.cpp file  that """"expected curly bracket at the end of input""""."""
Now  Come back to our  text editor .
"""As I said before, the closing curly bracket marks the end of the function main"""
Hence re-insert the bracket here. Now Save the file.
Let us execute it again.
You can recall the previously entered commands by using up arrow key.
That is what I did now.
"""Yes, it is working."""
I will show you another common error.
Let us switch back to our text editor.
"""Now, suppose here we missed std."""
Let us save the file.
Come back to our  terminal .
Let us compile .
We see that there is an  error at line no.3 and  line no.6 in our talk.cpp file.
"""That """"expected identifier before 'semicolon' """" and """" 'cout' was not declared in this scope""""."""
As cout is the standard C++ library function.
and the entire C++ library function is defined under std namespace .
Hence it is giving an error.
Let us now  fix the error.Come back to our Text editor.  Type std here.
Let us save it.
Let us compile it again.
"""Yes, it is working.As an assignment,"""
write a program to print your name and city.
We used single line comment in this tutorial.
Now just try to give a multiline comment.
"""For more details, please  write to  contact @spoken-tutorial.org"""
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Loops in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial we will learn,"""
"""for loop,while loop and"""
do…while loop.  We will do this with the help of some examples.
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.
"""Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
Let us start with the introduction to loops.
Loops are used to execute a group of instructions repeatedly.
Depending on the purpose they are divided into three types:
while loop  do…..while loop and
for loop Let us start with the while loop first.
A while loop tests the condition in the beginning.
The structure is: while ( condition )
within the bracket statement block.
Now move on to  do….while loop .
A do..while loop is executed at least once before the condition could be validated.
The structure is:
"""do (within the brackets) statement block,"""
after the bracket the while ( condition ).
You can see that the condition is checked at the end.
"""Now,let us see an example on while loop and do...while loop ."""
I have already typed the code on the editor.
Let me open it.
Note that our file name is while.c..
Today we are going to learn addition of first 10 numbers using while loop.
Let me explain the code now.
Inside the main() function we have declared two integer variables x and y and initialized to 0.
This is our while loop.
The condition of the while loop is x is less than or equal to 10.
Here the value of x is added to the value of y.
The value obtained after the addition is stored in y.
Then we print the value of y.
Here  x is incremented.
That means the variable x is increased by one.
"""Now,let us execute the program."""
"""Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard."""
Type gcc space while dot c space hyphen o space while
Type   ./while  (dot slash while). Press Enter.
The output is displayed.
Now lets us see the working of  while loop.
Let me resize the window.
"""Here, first the  value of  x  and  y  is 0."""
This is our  while  condition.
Here we check whether x is less than or equal to 10 which means the values of x will be from 0 to 10.
"""Then we add y plus x (i.e) 0 plus 0, we get 0."""
"""We print the value of y, here we get 0."""
Then x is incremented which means now the value of x will be 1.
"""Then we  will check the condition again, 1 is less than or equal to 10. If the condition is  true  then we will add the values,"""
y (i.e ) 0 plus x that is 1. 0 plus 1 is 1.
We print the value as 1.
Again x is incremented.
Now the value of x is 2.
We check the condition again.
"""2 is less than or equal to 10, if the condition is  true  then we will add the values, (i.e ) 1 plus 2 which will give 3."""
We print the value as 3.
"""Like this, it will go on up to x is less than or equal to 10 (x<=10)."""
"""Now, we will see the same program using  do….while loop  ."""
Here is our program.
Note that our file name is  do hyphen while dot c .
This part is already explained in the previous program.
"""So, let us move on to a  do...while loop ."""
"""Here, first the body of the loop will be executed  and then the condition is checked."""
The value of x is added to the value of y and the value obtained after the addition is stored in y.
The logic is same as in  while  program.
Type  gcc space do hyphen while dot c space hyphen o space do . Press  Enter .
Type  dot slash do (./do). Press Enter .
We can see that the output is similar  to our  while  program.
"""Now, let us see the working of  do...while loop ."""
Let me resize the window.
Here the value x and y is 0.
We add those values. Then we will get 0.
Now the value of y is 0.
We print the value as 0.
"""Then x is incremented by 1 which means now the value of x is 1, then the condition will be checked."""
You can see that the body of loop is executed first.
"""Anyhow, if the condition is  false  then also we will get a value that is 0."""
"""Now, here we will check whether 1 is less than or equal to 10."""
The condition is true. Again we will add the values.
Now 0 plus 1.
Then we will print the value of y as 1.
Again x will be incremented.
Now the value of x is 2.
Then we check 2 is  less than or equal to 10.
We will go back here.
Then we will add the values. 1 plus 2 is 3.
We print the value of y as 3.
"""Like this, the conditions will be checked till the value of x will be less than or equal to 10."""
Note that here the while condition ends with the semicolon.
In while loop the condition does not end with the semicolon.
Now let us see how to execute these programs in C++.
This is our while program in C++.
The logic and implementation are same as in our C program.
There are a few changes like the header file as iostream in place of stdio.h.
We have included the 'using' statement here using namespace std and here we have used the cout function in place of  printf  function.
The structure of  while loop is same as in our C program.
Lets us execute the program.
Come back to a terminal.
"""To execute, type   g++ space while dot cpp space hyphen o space while1 . Press Enter ."""
Type  dot slash while1 (./while1). Press  Enter .
You can see that the output is similar to our while program in C.
Now let us see the  do... while  program in C++.
Come back to the text editor.
"""Here also there are similar changes like the  header file , the  using statement  and the  cout  function."""
Rest of the things are similar.
Type  g++ space do hyphen while dot cpp space hyphen o space do1 . Press  Enter .
Type  dot slash do1 (./do1). Press  Enter .
We can see that the output is similar to our  do...while program in C.
Now we will see some common errors and their solutions.
Come back to our text editor.
"""Suppose, here I will not increment the value of x."""
Click on Save Let us see what happens.
Come back to the terminal Let me clear the prompt.
Press the up-arrow key twice.
Again press the up-arrow key.
The output is displayed.
"""We can see number of zeros, this is because the loop does not have the terminating condition ."""
It is known as  infinite loop.
Infinite loop  can cause the system to become unresponsive.
It causes the program to consume all the  processors  time  but it can be terminated.
"""Come back to our program, let us fix the error."""
Type  x++  and a semicolon.
Click on Save. Let us execute again.
Come back to terminal.
Press the up-arrow key.
"""Yes, it is working."""
We will move back to our slides.
"""In this tutorial we learned,"""
while loop   example. while(x is less than or equal to 10)

The syntax of the  for loop  is
for (variable initialization; variable condition; and variable increment or decrement)
and here will be the body of the loop.
Hello everybody.
Welcome to this tutorial on Control Execution in KTurtle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
'while' loop  and
'for' loop.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux OS Version 12.04 KTurtle version 0.8.1 beta."""
We assume that you have basic working knowledge of Kturtle.
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website: http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Let's open a new KTurtle Application.
Click on Dash  home.
"""In the Search bar, type: """"kturtle""""."""
Click on the option. KTurtle Application opens.
Let me first explain about what is control execution.
Control execution is controlling the flow of a program.
Different conditions are used to control program execution.
"""Loop is a block of code,  executed repeatedly till a certain condition is satisfied."""
e.g. “while” loop and  “for” loop.
Let's begin the tutorial with “while” loop.
"""In  the “while” loop, the code inside the loop repeats till Boolean evaluates to """"false""""."""
Let me explain the structure of “while” loop: while 'loop condition' {  do something with loop increment variable }
I already have the code in a text-editor.
Let me copy the program from text editor and paste it into KTurtle editor.
Please pause the tutorial here and type the program into your KTurtle editor.
Resume the tutorial after typing the program.
"""Let me zoom into the program text, it may possibly be a little blurred."""
Let me explain the code.
'#' hyash sign comments a line written after it.
"""It means, this line will not be executed while running the program."""
reset command sets “Turtle” to its default position.
$x=0 initializes the value of variable 'x' to zero.
"""Message in a program is given within double quotes after the keyword  """"message"""". “message” command takes string as input."""
It shows a pop-up dialog-box containing text from the string.
"""while $x<30 checks the “while” condition,"""
$x=$x+3 increments the value of  variable $x by 3.
fontsize 15  sets the font-size used by print command.
"""fontsize takes number as input, set in pixels."""
forward 20 commands Turtle to move 20 steps forward on the canvas.
print $x displays the value of variable 'x' on the canvas.
Let me click on the Run button to run the program.
A message dialog-box pops up. Let me click OK.
"""Multiples of 3, from 3 to 30, are displayed on the canvas."""
Turtle moves 20 steps forward on the canvas.
Let's next work with “for” loop.
“for” loop is a counting loop.
"""Every time  the code inside for loop is executed,"""
variable value is incremented till it reaches the end value.
Let me explain the structure of “for” loop.
for variable = start number to end number { Statement}
Let me clear the current program.
"""Let me type """"clear"""" command and run to clean the canvas."""
Let me copy the program from text-editor and paste it into KTurtle editor.
Please pause the tutorial here and type the program into your KTurtle editor.
Resume the tutorial after typing the program.
"""Let me zoom into the program text, it may possibly be a little blurred."""
Let me explain the program.
reset command sets Turtle to its default position.
$r=0 initializes the value of variable 'r' to zero.
for $x= 1 to 15 checks “for” condition  from 1 to 15.
$r=$x*($x+1)/2 calculates the value of variable 'r'.
fontsize 18 sets the font-size used by print command.
print $r displays the value of  variable 'r'  on the canvas.
forward 15 commands Turtle to moves 15 steps forward on the canvas.
"""go 10,250 commands Turtle to go 10 pixels from left of canvas and 250 pixels from top of canvas."""
“Turtle” displays all print commands without any time gap.
"""“Wait 2” command makes Turtle to wait for 2 seconds, before executing next command."""
“print” command displays the string within double quotes and also displays variable '$r'.
Let me click on the  Run button to run the program.
"""A series of sum of first 15 natural numbers and  """"Sum of first 15 natural numbers"""" are displayed on the canvas."""
Turtle moves 15 steps forward on the canvas.
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial."""
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learned to use"""
“while” loop and “for”  loop.
"""As an assignment, I would like you to write programs to evaluate-"""
Multiples of 2 using “while” loop.

Welcome to this Spoken tutorial of Mozilla Firefox.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Tabbed Browsing, Storing content offline, Blocking Pop-ups."""
"""In this tutorial, we will use Firefox version 7.0 on Ubuntu 10.04."""
Mozilla Firefox allows you to load multiple web pages into separate tabs within the same browser window.
The biggest advantage of tabbed browsing is that it eliminates the need to display multiple browser windows.
And hence it helps to keep your desktop clutter-free.
Each tab occupies the browser's entire viewing area when displayed.
It eliminates the need to frequently resize and reposition the opened browser windows.
Tabbed browsing also consumes less memory and operating system resources than tiled-window browsing
provided the user does not open too many tabs at once.
"""Let's say, you are on a particular webpage."""
Here is a link - “Firefox for Desktop”.
You can open this link in a new tab.
"""To do so, right-click on the link."""
"""In the context menu, click on Open link in new tab."""
"""You notice that a new tab opens to the right of the existing tab, in the same browser window."""
"""So, without closing or moving out of your window, you can open another webpage in the same window."""
You can also open a new tab by clicking on File and New Tab.
The shortcut keys for this are Ctrl+T.
"""Notice that when you open a new tab, the new tab immediately becomes active."""
Now go to the URL bar and type: ‘www.google.com’.
"""You will now have 3 tabs, each with a different web page!"""
You can also open a new tab by clicking the ‘+’  button to the right of the rightmost tab.
We can also arrange  the tabs as per our requirements.
"""Just click on a tab and without releasing the mouse button, move it to the required location."""
Now release the 'mouse button'.
The tab is now in the desired location.
Let us look at some basic operations which Mozilla Firefox allows us to perform.
Let us change the search engine to “google”.
In the Search bar type: ‘email wikipedia’ and click on the magnifying glass to the right of the 'Search bar'.
The relevant Wikipedia page is the first search result.
Let's open this page by clicking on the link.
"""Now, click on File and then on “Save Page As”."""
Let's save the file on the Desktop with the name ‘Search.html’.
"""Now, let us open a new tab in the browser window by clicking on File and New Tab."""
"""Now, let's open our saved page in this new Tab window."""
Click on File and Open File .
Browse and open the saved file.
"""In the URL bar, you see that the address is not an internet address but a local location on your computer."""
"""Now you can read this page, even when you are offline."""
Pop-ups are windows that appear automatically without your permission.
Firefox allows us to control both pop-ups and pop-unders through the Content tab within Preferences window.
"""On 'Windows', this would be within the Options window."""
"""Pop-up blocking is turned on, by default."""
Click on Edit and Preferences.
Windows users please click on Tools and Options.
"""In the Content tab, the first option Block pop-up windows is checked, by default."""
"""If not, then please check this option."""
The various options of this dialog box will be discussed in another tutorial.
Click on the Close button.
Here is a quick summary of what we learnt:
"""Tabbed Browsing, Storing content offline, Blocking Pop ups."""
Try this comprehension test assignment.
Open a new tab.Change the search engine to ‘google’.
Search for 'The history of email'.
Save the first result and open it in a new tab to view as an offline document.
Change the search engine to ‘bing’.
"""Again, search for 'The history of email'."""
Save the link ‘History of Email & Ray Tomlinson’ and open it in a new tab to view as an offline document.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Creating classes.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
A class in real world
A class in Java
Structure of a Java class
Syntax for a Java class
And a simple example of Java class.
"""Here we are using: Ubuntu version 11.10, JDK 1.6 and Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know how to write, compile and run a simple Java program in Eclipse."""
"""If not, please see the spoken-tutorial on these topics, available at spoken-tutorial.org."""
Now let us see what is a class in real world.
Whatever we can see in this world are all objects.
And all the objects can be categorized into special groups.
Each group is termed as a class.
"""For example, human being is a class."""
We are all different objects of this class.
"""We all have different properties like eyes, legs, hands etc."""
which are common to the 'human being' class.
"""Seeing, eating, walking etc are behaviors that are common to the human being class."""
Now let us see what is the class in Java?
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.
Structure of a Java Class; A class defines:
A set of properties called variables .
And a set of behaviors called methods.
"""Now, let us see the syntax for declaring classes."""
"""modifier – class -classname within  curly brackets variable, constructor and method declarations."""
"""We will learn about these in detail, in the coming tutorials."""
"""Now, let us create a simple class  using Eclipse."""
I have already opened Eclipse.
Now let us create a Project.
"""So click on File, go to New  and click on Java Project."""
"""In the New Project Wizard, enter the Project name  as ClassDemo with C and D in capital."""
Then click on Finish.
We see that the Project ClassDemo is created.
We will now create a Java class named Student.
"""So, right click on ClassDemo, go to New and click on Class."""
"""In the New Java Class wizard, type the Name as Student."""
We can see that the modifier here is public.
This shows that the class is visible to all the classes everywhere.
"""If a class has no modifier which is the default, it is visible only within its own package."""
We will learn about packages in the later tutorials.
Here I have selected public.
"""In the 'method stubs', select public static void main."""
Then click on Finish.
We can see that the class named Student is created.
"""Now, let me remove the comments."""
"""A Student class can contain properties like Name, Roll Number, Marks etc."""
"""So, inside this class Student, let me declare two variables roll_Number and name."""
"""So, I will type int roll underscore number semicolon."""
String name semicolon.
"""So, I have declared two variables."""
"""Now, a class also contains methods."""
"""So, let me create a method named StudentDetail."""
This method will give the details of each student.
"""So let me type, void studentDetail then opening and closing brackets, curly brackets open."""
"""Now, this method will give the roll_number and name of the Student."""
"""So, type System dot out dot  println within brackets and double quotes The roll number  is  we can type it as number is, close the double quotes plus roll_number semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: System dot  out dot println within brackets and double quotes The name is plus  name and semicolon."""
"""Now, inside the main method, we will type: System dot out dot  println within brackets and double quotes We have created a class with 2 variables and 1 method."""
"""Thus, We have created  the class student."""
"""Now, let me save the file by pressing Control and S keys simultaneously."""
Let me Run the program by pressing Control and F11 keys simultaneously.
"""We get the output as :We have created a class with 2 variables and 1 method,"""
just as we had typed in the main method.
Thus we have successfully created a class.
"""So, in this tutorial, we learnt about the class in java and how to create a class in java."""
"""For self assessment, create a class named Employee with variables emp underscore number and emp underscore name ."""
And method printEmployee which displays the employee information.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on If else constructs in java.
About conditional statements
Types of conditional statements and
How to use conditional statements in Java programs.
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu v 11.10 JDK 1.6  and  Eclipse 3.7.0."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of using:"""
"""Arithmetic, Relational and Logical operators in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown."""
Conditional statements- You may have to perform different actions for different decisions in your code.
In such cases you can use conditional statements.
A conditional statement helps to control the flow of execution of a program.
"""In Java, we have the following conditional statements:"""
If statement If...Else statement
If...Else if statement
Nested If statement Switch statement
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about If, If...Else and If...Else If statements in detail."""
if statement: if statement is used to execute a block of statements based on a condition.
It is called a single conditional statement.
Syntax for If statement ;
"""In the if statement, if the condition is true, the block is executed."""
"""If the condition is false, the block is skipped and it is  not executed."""
"""Now,  let us look at an example to understand how the if statement can be used."""
"""So, let us switch to eclipse."""
We will write a program to identify whether a person is Minor.
I have already created a class Person.
"""Now, inside the main method, let us declare a variable ‘age’ of type int."""
"""So, type inside the main method: int space age  equal to 20 semicolon."""
"""Now, we will write an If statement as follows:"""
"""Next line, if  within  brackets age < 21  open curly brackets. Press Enter."""
"""Here, we are checking if age is less than 21."""
Whatever is inside the brackets belongs to the if block.
"""So, inside the brackets type:"""
System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The person is Minor  semicolon.
"""Here, if age is less than 21, then “The person is minor” will be displayed."""
So save and run the file.
"""We get the output as follows: """"The person is minor""""."""
"""In this case, the person's age is 20 which is less than 21."""
"""So, we got the output as “The person is minor”."""
"""Now, we will learn about if...else statement."""
If...Else statement is used to execute alternative statements.
These are based on a single condition.
Let us look at the syntax for writing If…Else statement.
"""If the condition is true,   the statement or block of code is executed."""
"""Else, it executes another statement or  block of code."""
We will now see how the If…else statement can be used in a program.
"""So, let us switch to the eclipse."""
We will now  write a program to identify whether the person is minor or major.
"""So, inside the main method, type: int age  equal to 25"""
"""then, if within brackets age greater than 21"""
"""within curly brackets, type: System dot out dot  println within brackets The person is Major."""
"""Then type, next line,"""
else  within curly brackets  type:
System dot out dot println within brackets in double quotes  The person is Minor semicolon.
"""Here, if  age is less than 21,   “The person is Minor” will be displayed."""
"""Else, the “The person is Major” will be displayed."""
"""So, now let us save and  run the program."""
"""We get the output as: """"The person is Major""""."""
"""Here, the person's  age is 25, which is greater than 21."""
"""Therefore, the program  displayed  the output as “The person is Major”."""
If…Else If statement: If…Else If statement is used to execute various set of statements.
These are based on the two given conditions.
You can also add more conditions based on your requirement.
It is also called as   branching  or decision making statement.
"""Now, Let us look at the syntax for writing  the If…Else If statement."""
If statement initially checks for condition 1.
"""If condition 1 is true, it executes the statement-or-block 1 code."""
"""Else, it again checks for condition 2."""
"""If condition 2 is true, it executes statement-or-block 2."""
"""Else, it executes statement 3 or block code 3."""
"""In this way, we can extend the code by If…Else blocks."""
These blocks can have multiple conditions.
"""The corresponding code will get executed, until it finds the true condition."""
"""If all the conditions are false, it will execute the final Else section."""
We will see how the If…Else If statement can be used in a program.
"""So, switch to Eclipse."""
I have already created a class named Student.
Let us write a program to identify grade of a student.
This is done based on the score percentage.
"""So, inside the main method, type: int space testScore equal to 70 semicolon."""
The input variable named testScore is used to get the score percentage.
"""Next line, type: if within brackets testScore less than 35 then within curly brackets type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes C grade semicolon."""
"""If the 'testScore' is less than 35, then the program displays """"C Grade""""."""
"""Next line, type else."""
"""Next line, if within brackets testScore greater than or equal to 35 AND (&&) testScore  less than or equal to  60. Put this whole condition within brackets open curly brackets, press Enter."""
Type: System dot out dot println within brackets B grade semicolon
"""Here, the program will check for the second condition in the Else If section."""
"""If the 'testScore' is between 35 and 60 then the program displays """"B Grade""""."""
"""Next line, type: else within brackets type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes A grade semicolon."""
"""So Finally, if both the conditions are false, the program displays “A Grade""""."""
"""Now, let us save and run this code."""
We get the output as A Grade.
"""In this program, the student’s 'testScore' is 70."""
So the output will be displayed as “A Grade”.
Now  Let us change the testScore to  55.
"""Now, save and run this program."""
"""In this case, the output will be displayed as “B Grade”."""
We can also increase the number of conditions.
Let us add one more condition after the “B grade” output section.
"""So type here, else, next line, if within brackets testScore greater than or equal to 60 AND (&&) testScore less than or equal to 70."""
Open curly brackets press Enter System  dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes O grade semicolon.
"""Here, if the 'testScore' is between 60 and 70 the program will display """"O Grade""""."""
"""Now, change the testScore of the student to 70."""
"""Now, save and run the file."""
The program will display the output as “O grade”.
It is not “A grade” as it displayed before.
The program will display “A grade” for the testScore greater than 70.
While coding conditional structures:
Always remember to add a semicolon while terminating a statement.
But don’t add semicolons after the condition.
Add the block of code within curly brackets.
Curly braces are optional if the block contains a single statement.
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial,"""
We have  Explained: * conditional statements

Welcome to this tutorial on how to write letters using latex.
You can see three windows.
These correspond to the three distinct phases in typesetting through latex:
"""creation of source file, compilation to produce the pdf file and viewing it through a pdf reader."""
I am using the free pdf reader “Skim” in Mac OSX because it automatically loads the latest pdf file after every compilation.
There are pdf browsers in Linux and also in Windows that have this capability.
Let us go through the source file and see what each command does.
The first line says that this belongs to 'letter document' class.
12 point is the text size.
The first component of the letter is the ‘from address’. It appears between the braces here.
The result of this is seen in the top right hand corner of the output file.
Two consecutive slashes start a new line.
If I remove the double slashes from here –
"""save, compile using pdflatex –"""
you can see that these two lines get merged in one line.
Previously with a double slash we asked latex to split the line.
"""Now these reverse slashes are no longer there, so latex does not know that it has to break the line there."""
Let me put the slashes back.
"""Save, Compile."""
It is to be understood that after every change we need to save before compilation.
Let us see what happens when we give an empty address.
"""Let me just come here,"""
"""mark it,"""
"""go to the end of the line, delete it, save it, compile it."""
You can see that the from address has disappeared from here.
"""Note that today’s date appears automatically in American style: month, date and then year."""
This is obtained through the command slash date slash today.
"""We can prevent the automatic appearance of the date with an empty list, as we do now."""
Save.
"""Compile,The date has gone."""
"""Suppose that we want to put our own date, let us enter it with date first as follows."""
"""9th July 2007, Save, Compile."""
Got the date.
This is the date on which this tutorial was created the first time.
"""On compiling it, we see this Indian format appearing in the output file."""
Let us put the address back.
And the document is back to the previous state by recompiling.
The signature command's argument appears at the bottom of the letter.
We begin the document and then the letter.
The ‘to address’ comes first. It appears in the top left hand corner of the output.
I have addressed this to Mr. N. K. Sinha.
The command ‘slash opening’ is used to address the recipient.
You may have already noticed that all latex commands begin with a reverse slash.
The text of the letter comes next.
One starts a new paragraph in latex through a blank line as we show now.
Let me come here. Right now this sentence starting at ‘we are’ is here.
Let’s open. Let's take this to the next line.
I have left a blank line. Let me save this.
Compile this.
You can see that this has gone to a new paragraph.
"""With a new paragraph, the letter has gone to two pages."""
"""Let us see if the font size is reduced to 10, we can bring the letter back to one page."""
Let me do that now.
Save.
"""Compile,You can see that the whole letter has come into one page."""
Let me put this back to 12 pt.
And let me also remove this paragraph bit.
And let me compile this.
Okay.
I now want to explain the itemize environment which is created with a pair of 'begin' and 'end itemize' commands.
Every piece of text that starts with a ‘slash item’ appears in a bulleted form.
Can I get numbers in the place of bullets here?
"""You just have to change the """"itemize"""" into """"enumerate"""" as I do now."""
"""Let me just change this to """"enumerate""""."""
Of course! It is always a good idea to save as often as possible.
Let me compile this again.
You can see that the bullets have become numbers now.
"""In closing, I have included, ‘Yours sincerely’ which comes here."""
We have already talked about the signature.
"""Finally, the command 'cc' helps mark this letter to other recipients."""
I end the letter with ‘end letter’ command and then the document is completed with the ‘end document’ command.
Feel free to modify the content and try them out.
"""Until you become confident, change only one thing at a time and make sure by immediate compilation that whatever you have done is correct."""
"""Although I talked about the letter writing process in a Mac, the same source file will work in all Latex systems including those in Linux and Windows operating systems."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Installation of MarcEditor on Windows.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to install  MarcEditor  on a 64-bit Windows machine."""
"""To record this tutorial, I’m using: Windows 10 Pro Operating System and  Firefox web browser."""
This tutorial is most suitable for library staff.
"""Before moving ahead, please ensure that you have the following on your machine- Windows 10, 8 or 7,"""
"""any web browser. For eg: Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome."""
"""In your existing library, you may have the library records in an Excel spreadsheet."""
"""And, your library is now being migrated to Koha Library Management System."""
"""So, all the records will need to be converted from Excel into MARC format."""
It is important to know that: the records in Excel spreadsheet will first have to be converted into MARC format and then imported into Koha.
This is because Koha does not have the provision to directly import data which is in Excel format.
Let us begin.
"""To convert Excel data into MARC file i.e. (dot) mrc format, we will be using MarcEdit software."""
"""To install this software, go to the browser and type this URL."""
A new page with the heading Downloads opens.
"""Under Current Development, go to MarcEdit 7.0.x/MacOS 3.0.x  Locate Windows 64-bit download."""
"""However, if you have a 32-bit machine, then you should click on the link Windows 32-bit download."""
"""To check whether your machine is 32-bit or 64-bit, go to the bottom left corner of the machine."""
Click on the Start icon.
Scroll up and click on Settings.
"""From these icons, click on System- Display, notifications, apps, power."""
This opens another window with few options on the left side.
Locate the tab About and click on it.
"""On the same page, towards the right side, under the section PC, locate System type."""
The details of your machine’s operating system will be displayed.
"""For my machine, it says 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor."""
"""After reading the details, close the window."""
"""To do so, go to the top right corner and click on the cross mark."""
"""We will again come back to the same page, Downloads."""
"""As my machine is 64-bit, I will click on 64-bit download."""
Another new window with the heading 64-bit download opens with two sections- Non-Administrator and Administrator.
"""Next, I will click on Download MarcEdit 7 link at the bottom of the Administrator section."""
This is because I am the designated Koha administrator of my library.
A dialog-box MarcEdit_Setup64Admin.msi appears.
We can see 2 options here- Save File and   Cancel.
Click on the Save File button at the bottom.
"""After doing so, go to the Downloads folder of your machine."""
"""Here, you can see that the file MarcEdit_Setup64Admin.msi has been saved."""
"""Now, right-click on the saved file and from the options that appear, click on Install."""
"""In the User Account Control dialog box, click on Yes."""
Another window with the name Welcome to the MarcEdit 7 Setup Wizard appears.
Click on the Next button at the bottom of the page.
Another new window with the title License Agreement opens.
Read the License Agreement carefully.
"""And from the 2 options, I do not agree and I agree, click on the I Agree radio button."""
"""Then, click on the Next button at the bottom of the window."""
A new window named Select Installation Folder opens.
It shows the path of the folder where the installed software will be saved.
"""Alternately, you may install this software in a different folder of your choice. Do so by typing the required path in the field Folder."""
You can also click on the tab Browse and select the desired path.
"""However, I will keep the folder path as it is, in the field Folder."""
Now click on the Next button at the bottom of the window.
Another new window   Confirm Installation opens.
Now click on the Next button at the bottom of the same window.
Installing MarcEdit 7 window opens.
"""After this, we see a success message window. It says-  Installation Complete. MarcEdit 7 has been successfully installed."""
Click on the Close button to exit this window.
A window with the title MarcEdit 7.0.250 By Terry Reese opens.
Now minimize all the windows that are open.
You will see that a shortcut is created on the Desktop.
"""With this, we have successfully installed MarcEditor on the Desktop of a 64-bit Windows machine."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial of Meet the GIMP.
In the previous tutorial I left you with this image.
I want to make the ship a bit darker in this image.
And the best way to do this is to work with Layers.
"""So, first I zoom into the image where the ship is."""
And I click on the option of adding a New Layer and simply add a new layer.
I name this layer as 'ship' and I choose the Layer Fill Type as Transparency.
Now the next step is to reduce the luminosity of all the three colour channels and to do that I have to use the Multiply mode & this time
I use gray colour to be multiplied with the other colours here because it helps in getting the ship darker in the image.
"""So, go to the option of colour selection mode and reduce the value of gray colour by pulling the slider down until I get a nice gray colour shade."""
"""And now, just pull the gray colour into the image and you get a darker image with a dark ship."""
"""Coming back to the Layers dialog, I can control the intensity of gray colour with the help of opacity slider and by turning the gray layer on and off."""
But the effect of the layer is applied to the whole image and I want the effect to be restricted to the area of the ship.
"""For doing that, I use a layer mask."""
A layer mask defines where the layer should be visible and where it should be invisible.
I go to the layer named ship and I right click on that layer. And then select the option Add Layer Mask and I select Black in Initialize Layer Mask because black helps in hiding all the layers & white helps t
And these other options I will explain in future tutorials. Click on Add.
You can see the layer has no effect.
"""I can switch the layer on & off, but no effect after adding layer mask."""
But I can paint into the layer mask or use some other edit tools.
"""And when I paint or use the tools , the effect will be revealed into the image."""
"""To paint into the layer, I use white foreground colour & black background colour."""
"""I click on the Brush tool, go to the option dialog, and select a  brush which is 19 pixels in Circle."""
And I again go to the Layers dialog to check if the layer mask is selected because I have to paint the layer mask and not the layer.
Let me show you the effect.
I change the layer mode to Normal layer mode & as you see the fore layer in the image is invisible.
I select a brush here and start painting on the portion of the ship and you can see a gray layer is revealed.
"""Now when I select the layer itself & paint, you can see the layer is now painted in white colour and not gray."""
I select the layer mask again and press the ‘x’ key to change the foreground colour to black and background colour to white.
And start painting with white colour into my layer mask.
And because of  black colour the image is hidden.
I can undo the unwanted effects simply by pressing ctrl + z and here we are back to paint the layer mask of the ship.
Now I change the background colour to black and foreground colour to white and start filling the form of the ship.
I think it’s much easier to paint in Normal mode.
"""As we get a gray ship after painting in Normal mode, it is easier to differentiate from  background than in Multiply layer mode."""
"""To paint into the fine edges of the ship, I reduce the brush size."""
You can select a small brush in 3 different methods.
"""First is by using the scale to reduce the size of the brush,"""
2nd way is to click the small blue triangle here and select the brush of any size or else you can do that by typing the square brackets.
'Open square bracket' reduces the brush size and 'close square bracket' increases the size of the brush.
"""I want to use the small brush for the details, so I press 'open square bracket'."""
But you can imagine what I have to do here and you don’t have to look over my shoulder for painting the whole ship.
Now I have finished painting the whole ship with a gray layer.
And I will have to check for the areas where I have overpainted the edge.
"""So, I switch the layer mode to Multiply mode and reduce the opacity slider a bit."""
Adjust the opacity slider in such a way that you get a dark ship in the image.
And I have done a fairly good job.
But I am not so happy with the surface of the river in front of the ship.
And I have to make it a bit brighter.
"""So, I change the foreground colour to black by pressing the x key and start painting into the surface of the river in front of the ship with black colour to make it less darker than the ship."""
I have to check out this effect once I finish working on the image and do the changes accordingly.
Now let’s check out the work I have done.
I zoom into the image using the  zoom mode and I can make the ship a bit darker and brighter just by sliding the opacity slider.
I think this looks good and I have done a good job by masking the layer.
"""But I think the colour of the ship is a bit dull and this is possible because the 'ship' layer is above the 'colour correction layer' and they are working before the ship layer; so I just drop the 'ship' lay"
"""And you can see the change, the colour of the ship gets neutral now."""
Now I look at the whole image and the shortcut key is Shift+ Ctrl +E.
"""And I think it is a fairly good balance between the background colour, the birds and the ship. Perhaps I should slide down a bit with the intensity of the ship."""
And now it looks better.
I think this is best.
"""When I compare the image without darkening and  the ship layer, the birds and the ship are fairly dark in the ship layer and I think I got a good result by using layer mask for this image."""
I can change the effects with the help of all the layer tools at anytime.
"""I nearly forgot a thing that I painted the layer mask with very sharp edge & when I zoom into the image, you can see there is a hard border here and I want a little bit smoother."""
"""Because this may look a bit artificial, specially in a foggy seen."""
"""For that, I select the layer mask to edit it a bit and choose Filter from the tool bar and select Blur."""
In Blur I choose Gaussian Blur and go into the part of the ship and I drop down the value of Horizontal Radius to 4 and click on OK and blur the layer mask and you can see the effect that the hard edge of the
Now I m ready to do some corrective work with the image.
"""When you look at the image, you can see here a bit of wood in the water and on the left side is half a bird which is cut off at the edge and I want to clone them out."""
"""So, again I choose the Zoom tool, and zoom in where the part of wood is and now choose the Healing tool."""
Healing tool is bit like the Clone tool but it works better in this case here.
"""When I select the healing tool, I get a circle with the mouse point but I can’t click into the image & there is a forbidden sign in the mouse point."""
The forbidden sign is because I haven’t selected the heal source and I can do it with the control (Ctrl) and click.
I have to select a good heal source and then I have to press Ctrl and click and I think this is a good place as heal source and now click on the wood part.
There is a problem here.
And the problem here is that I am working on the wrong layer.
I have to work on the background layer and I was trying to do the edit on the layer mask.
"""Of course, I have to choose a background layer and make a copy of that layer because I don’t want to alter the original background layer."""
Now let's try Healing tool again.
And now I have made another mistake.
My source was this gray layer above.
"""And of course, I undo this and select a new source here. Alright, take that here and just click here and it is gone."""
"""For this part, I select this part as the source and click and you can see it’s gone."""
Let’s look at the image in 100% mode.
"""It looks quite good, perhaps I should have done it with a little bit greater brush because these dots are still together."""
So again I select the Healing tool and select the source and clicked on the dots.
I think that worked.
Now I have to disappear this half cut bird on the left side.
"""For this, I zoom again into the image here and  I select the Clone tool."""
Cloning tool is not so complex like healing tools and I really don’t have a big experience in using this tool as it is new in the GIMP.
"""So, I have to follow same procedure like Healing tool. I just click here as a source, click on the bird here and I think this works."""
"""Back to 100%. Perfect, this bird is gone."""
I think this image is ready now.
First I wanted to make this image a bit brighter but I think I do it as finishing steps and I think it works the way it is now.
And I want to give this image to print to get a poster from it.
"""And the printer uses an aspect ratio of 3:2 and this image has the aspect ratio 2:1. So now, I have to change that."""
I can do this with the help of canvas size which is there in Image in the tool bar.
I select Canvas Size and see that the image is 1868 pixels wide and the height is 945 and for calculating the ratio I use my calculator.
"""So, I divide 1868 by 3 and then multiply with 2 which gives me 1245."""
"""I have to unchain this here, otherwise the width will change too and type into the Height 1245."""
Now the image is OK.
"""It will fit on top and leave a white strip on the bottom and I don’t resize the layers, just click on OK and now I have an image with little bit of nothing on the bottom."""
"""I have to fill the bottom part and for that, I choose a New Layer with Layer Fill Type White and use this layer as the bottom most layer."""
This white area in the bottom will be cut off later.
But I can use it as the clue for the printer.
The printer is simply a computer with a print engine behind it and test to get some clues how to handle.
"""This image is quite unusual here, it is nearly black and white and it has not much contrast in it."""
"""I select a rectangle here just over the whole image, select the Blend tool, the gradient filled with, set the Gradient to 'black to white'."""
And now I fill this here up with the gradient.
Just click and draw a line and now I have the full colour range from black and white in the rectangle.
I have an area here from black to full white.
I repeat this one more time.
Choosing the Blend tool here and this time I use a special gradient called Full saturation; it has all the colour range in it.
"""And again fill this  gradient, now I have hints for the printer how to preserve the image and if the colours are off I can always say here, this was suppose to be red and this was suppose to be green."""
I think this was it for today.
"""For more information, go to info@ meet the gimp.org or leave a comment on the blog meet the gimp.org or come to the forum of """"tips from the top floor""""."""
"""Tell me what you liked, what I could have made better, what you want to see in the future."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Increment and Decrement Operators in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:"""
Increment and decrement operators.
'++' eg. a++ which is postfix increment operator.
++a which is prefix increment operator.
'--' eg. a--  is  a postfix decrement operator.
--a  is a  prefix decrement operator.
We will also learn about Typecasting.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 11.10 as the operating system,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 in Ubuntu.
The ++ operator increases the existing value of the operand by one.
a++ and ++a are equivalent to a = a + 1.
The -- operator decreases the existing value of the operand by one.
a-- and --a are equivalent to a = a - 1.
I will now demonstrate the use of increment and decrement operators with the help of a C program.
"""I have already made the program, so I'll explain the code."""
"""Here, we have the code for increment and decrement operators in C."""
"""Here, I have taken an integer variable a that holds the value 1."""
This way we will be able to observe the changes in the value of a.
It will thus give us a better idea about the working of the operators.
Let's see how the postfix increment operator works.
The output of this printf statement is 1.
The value won't change.
This is because the postfix operation occurs after the operand is evaluated.
"""If an operation is performed on a++, it is performed on the current value of a."""
After that the value of a is incremented.
"""Now if we see the value of a here, it has been incremented by 1."""
We again initialize 'a' to 1 so as to reflect on the changes.
We now come to the prefix increment operators.
This printf statement prints 2 on the screen.
This is because a prefix operation occurs before the operand is evaluated.
So the value of 'a' is first incremented by 1 and then it is printed.
We again print a's value to see that there are no further changes.
Now let's check by executing this code.
"""I will comment out the following lines. Type /*, */"""
I have saved my file as incrdecr.c.
"""Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously."""
"""To compile, type the following on the terminal;  gcc space incrdecr dot c space minus o space incr. Press Enter."""
"""To execute the code, type ./incr (dot slash incr). Press enter."""
The output is displayed on the screen.
This is the output when you print a++.
This is the output when you print ++a.
We  can see that the result is as discussed before.
Now Coming back to the rest of the program.
I will now explain the postfix and prefix  decrement operators.
Remove the multi-line comments from here and here .
We now again assign the value of 1 to a.
This printf statement outputs the value of 1 as explained previously.
a's value will be decremented after a-- is evaluated as it is a postfix expression.
The next statement prints a's value as o.
a's  value has now being decremented by 1.
We now have the prefix decrement operator.
Output of this printf statement would be 0.
As it is a prefix operation.
The prefix operation occurs before the operand is evaluated.
This printf statements output is 0.
No further changes have been made to a's value.
Type return 0;  and close the ending curly bracket.
"""To compile, type the following on the terminal; gcc space incrdecr dot c space minus o space incr. Press Enter."""
"""To execute, type ./incr. Press Enter."""
This is the output when you print a--.
This is the output when you print --a.
"""So, now we see how the increment and  decrement operator work."""
"""If we want to write the same program in C++,"""
I can make a few changes to the above C code.
Let me go back to the editor.
Here is the C++ file with the necessary code.
Notice that the header is different from the C file header.
We have the using namespace statement also.
Also note that the output statement in C++ is cout.
"""So, apart from these differences, the two codes are very similar."""
Save the file. The file is saved with an extension .cpp.
Let's compile the code.
Open the terminal and type  g++ space incrdecr dot cpp space minus o space incr. Press Enter.
"""To execute, type  ./ incr (dot slash incr). Press Enter."""
The output is displayed on the screen.
"""So, we see the output is identical to the C program."""
We now have the concept of typecasting.
It is implemented the same way in both C and C++.
"""Typecasting is used to make a variable of one type, act like another type."""
"""Typecasting is done by enclosing the data type, you want, within parentheses."""
This cast is put in front of the variable you want to cast.
This typecast is valid for one single operation only.
"""Now a' will behave as a float variable, for a single operation."""
Here is an example that I have already created.
I shall now explain the code.
We first declare variables a and b as integers and c as float.
a is assigned the value of  5. b is assigned the value of 2.
We will perform operations on a and b.
We divide a by b. The result of division is stored in c.
We have used %.2f to denote a precision of 2 decimal places.
The result displayed will be 2.00 against the expected result of 2.50.
The fractional part has been truncated as both the operands a and b are integers.
"""To perform real division, one of the operands will have to be typecast to float."""
Here we are typecasting a to float. c now holds the value of real division.
Now the result of real division is displayed. The answer is 2.50 as expected.
Type return 0;  and close the  ending curly bracket.
Click on Save. Save the file with .c (dot c) extension.
I have saved my file as typecast.c.
Open the terminal.
"""To compile, type gcc space typecast dot c space minus o space type. Press Enter."""
"""To execute, type ./type. Press Enter."""
The output is displayed on the screen.
Looking at the two values we see the effects of typecasting.
We will summarize the tutorial now.
In this tutorial we learnt-
"""how  to  use the increment and decrement operators,"""
"""we learnt about the forms, Postfix  and Prefix,"""
also we  learnt about typecasting and how it is used.
As an assignment:
"""Write a program to solve the following expression, a divided by b plus c divided by d."""
"""The values of a, b, c and d are taken as input from the user."""
Use typecasting to perform real division.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Items and Inventory in FrontAccounting.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to add the following in FrontAccounting: Units of Measure"""
Items
Item Category and Sales Pricing
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS version 16.04"""
To practise this tutorial you must have knowledge of Higher secondary commerce and accounting and Principles of Bookkeeping
And you should have already set up an Organisation/Company in FrontAccounting.
"""If not, for relevant FrontAccounting tutorials please visit this website."""
Start the XAMPP services before you begin working on FrontAccounting interface.
"""Before we start, let us understand what are Items in FrontAccounting."""
Items are the things which we can buy or sell in the business.
We have to keep a record that lists key information about an inventory item.
"""Inventory is a complete listing of Stock in hand,"""
"""Work in progress, Raw materials and  Finished goods in hand."""
Let us open the Frontaccounting interface.
Type the username as admin and the password. Click on Login button.
The Frontaccounting interface opens.
Click on the Items and Inventory tab.
Maintenance panel is used to set up Items and Inventory details.
"""To do the setup, we have to make use of the following options: Units of Measure"""
Items and  Item Categories
Let us see how to set Units of Measure.
Units of Measure option has to be specified for each Item.
"""In the Maintenance panel, click on Units of Measure link."""
By default you will see each and hour as units of measure.
Let us see how to add a new Units of Measure for kilograms.
Type the details for the unit kilograms as shown here.
"""In the Decimal places drop-down box, select zero."""
Click on the Add new button at the bottom of the window to add this unit.
The pop-up message shows that we have successfully added a new unit.
We can also see the table with the updated entry.
Likewise you have to add the required Units of measure for your company’s items.
Click on Back link at the bottom of the window to go back to the FrontAccounting interface.
Now let us set the Item Categories to which the item belongs.
Item Categories helps us to group the items we buy and sell.
Click on Item Categories link.
"""We can see some default Item categories here - Charges, Components, Services and Systems."""
"""We need to create our own Item category, which defines. Item tax type,"""
Item Type and Units of Measure
"""Say for example, our company deals with finished goods i.e Laptops."""
So we will add a new Item category named Finished Goods.
Fill the details as shown here. Category Name – Finished Goods
Item Tax Type - Regular Item Type - Purchased
Units of Measure - Each
Keep all the remaining fields with default values.
Click on the Add New button at the bottom of the window to save the entry.
We can see that the newly added details are updated in the above table.
Click on Back link at the bottom of the window to go back to the FrontAccounting interface.
Next let us create a new Item for this Item category.
"""In Maintenance panel, click on the Items link."""
"""Here, we are prompted to fill in all the necessary information for the item. Fill the details as shown here."""
Make sure that you give a unique code for each item you fill. This is mandatory.
Category is the Item category to which the item belongs. We have selected Finished Goods.
Item type is to know whether the item is used for: manufacturing purpose
purchased from a supplier or for a service
Scroll down. And then click on the Insert New Item button at the bottom of the window.
The pop-up message shows that we have successfully added a new item.
Click on the drop-down box at the top of the window.
We can see that the new item has been added.

"""After completing the assignment, click on the drop-down box at the top of the window."""
Now you should see 2 items under Components and 3 items under Finished goods.
Click on Back link at the bottom of the window to go back to the Frontaccounting interface.
Pricing and Costs panel is used for selecting the pricing level of the items or inventory.
This option is used to assign sales prices to individual Sales item. Click on the Sales Pricing link.
Click on the Item drop-down box. Select the item Dell Laptop for which we want to assign the Sales Price.
"""Now, click on the Currency drop-down box."""
Select the currency as Indian Rupees.
Click on the Sales Type drop-down box.
There are two options:  Retail and  Wholesale
"""Here select the option, Retail."""
"""Next, click on the Price field. Type the Price against the Item as 53,000 per each."""
Then click on Add New button at the bottom of the window.
The pop-up message shows that we have successfully added a Sales price for the item Dell Laptop.
We can also see updated values in the table here.
Click on Back option at the bottom of the window to go back to the Frontaccounting interface.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Installing Eclipse on Linux.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to install Eclipse on Ubuntu and on Redhat operating systems."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using Ubuntu 11.10."""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must be"""
connected to the internet and must have knowledge of using terminal in Linux.
You must also have the root access or the sudo permission.
"""If you do not know what is a root or sudo, do not bother,"""
you can proceed through the tutorial.
"""If you are on a network that uses a proxy, then you must have access to the proxy."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials,  please visit our website as shown."""
We shall now install Eclipse on Ubuntu using the commands shown and
also learn about the minor changes required to do the same on Redhat.
Now let us open the terminal.
"""Press Control, Alt and t  ."""
This launches the terminal in Ubuntu.
"""If you are on a network that uses proxy, you will have to set it on the terminal."""
"""If you do not know what a proxy is, you may not be on a network that uses one."""
So you can skip this step.
"""For those who are using proxy,  will have to set it."""
There are two types of proxies.
One requires a username and password while the other doesn’t.
"""Find the type of proxy you are using, from the concerned person."""
"""On  the terminal, type: sudo SPACE HYPHEN s"""
"""When prompted, type the password."""
"""Note that as you type password, there is no feedback in the form of asterisk (*) or other symbols. Hit Enter."""
Notice that the prompt symbol has changed from 'DOLLAR' to 'HASH'.
Now type: export SPACE  http UNDERSCORE proxy  EQUAL TO http://tsuser:tspwd@10.24.0.2:8080
"""In this command, tsuser is the username for proxy authentication and tspwd is the password."""
Please change these values to suit your need.
10.24.0.2 is the host address of the proxy and 8080 is the port number.
Change these details also to suit your need. Press Enter.
In some cases the network does not require authentication.
In such cases the username and password can be left blank.
"""Since my proxy does not require authentication, I am going to remove those details."""
Press up arrow to get the previous command and remove the username and password and
Hit Enter. These commands  set the http proxy. We know how to set the https proxy.
Press up arrow to get the previous command and type 's' to change http to https and hit Enter.
We have now successfully set the proxy.
Press Ctrl + D to return to the normal prompt.
Type clear and hit Enter to clear the screen.
Now we shall install Eclipse.
Type: sudo SPACE apt HYPHEN get SPACE  update.
"""This command fetches a list of all the  available software, hit Enter."""
"""Depending on your internet speed, it takes a while to  fetch the list of software."""
The operation is complete when the terminal returns to  the 'DOLLAR' prompt($). Type clear and hit Enter to clear the screen.
Type: sudo space apt  hyphen get space install space eclipse and hit Enter.
This command fetches and installs the eclipse software on the system.
"""Notice the line that reads, Need to get 10.8 MB."""
Depending on your system this  number will be different and
"""depending on your internet speed, the time required to fetch the packages  will be different."""
At the prompt of 'Y' or 'N' type y and hit Enter.
All the required packages are  downloaded and unpack into the system.
The installation is complete when the terminal  returns to the Dollar prompt.
Now let us verify if eclipse is installed and is available on  the system.
"""Press  Alt+ F2, in the dialog box type  eclipse and hit Enter."""
"""This launches the eclipse application. If Eclipse has not been installed, it will not open the application."""
We get Workspace Launcher prompt. click OK to proceed.
And we get “Welcome to Eclipse” page.  This means  Eclipse has been successfully installed on the system .
"""The process for  installing Eclipse on Debian ,Kubuntu and Xubuntu is same as that on Ubuntu."""
The process of installing Eclipse on Redhat is similar to that on Ubuntu.
The only difference is the commands used for fetching and installing.
"""For fetching the list of  software, use sudo SPACE yum SPACE update."""
"""For installing eclipse, use sudo SPACE yum SPACE install SPACE eclipse."""
"""The process for installing Eclipse on Fedora, Centos and SUSE linux is the same as that on Redhat."""
This brings us to the end of the  tutorial .
We have seen how to install Eclipse on Ubuntu and similar Operating Systems and on  Redhat and similar Operating Systems.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on grep command.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn grep command."""
We will do this with the help of some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux OS and GNU BASH version 4.2.24"
"""Please note, GNU bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
"""As prerequisites, you should know basics of Linux terminal."""
"""For relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown."""
"""First, let us know about  regular expressions ."""
* Regular expressions are pattern matching techniques.
"""* when we have to find out whether a pattern exists in a line, paragraph or a file."""
For ex. If you want to search a phone number in the telephone directory
"""or  to find a keyword in a paragraph or a line, we use grep command. Let us move on to grep."""
"""grep searches for one or more patterns in one or more lines, paragraph or a file."""
"""If file-name is not mentioned, grep searches for the patterns in the standard input."""
"""If filename is missing, grep searches for the patterns in the standard input."""
I will demonstrate usage of grep using a demo file called grepdemo.txt.
Let us see the content of the file.
This is a file that has 13 entries.
"""Each entry has 6 fields- roll number, name, stream, marks and stipend amount."""
The fields are separated by a bar which is called a delimiter.
Let us see how grep works.
"""Say, we want to use 'grep' command to see who are the students in the computers stream."""
"""For this, we have to open the terminal."""
"""Now, type on the terminal:"""
grep space (within double quotes) computers after the double quotes space  grepdemo .txt
This would enlist those entries where stream is computers.
"""Now, compare the result with the original file."""
Come back to our text editor.
We see that the entry for  Zubin is not enlisted.
Why this is so?
This is because grep searched for the pattern “computers” with small c
"""while for Zubin, the stream is “Computers” with a capital C."""
The pattern matching is case sensitive.
"""To make it case insensitive, we need to use the minus i  option with grep."""
"""Come back to our terminal. Now, type: grep space minus i  space within double quotes computers after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt"""
Press  Enter.This will now enlist all the four entries.
"""So we saw, grep enlists only those lines of files that match a given pattern."""
We may do the reverse.
It is possible to make grep enlist only those lines that do not match the pattern.
"""For that, we have the minus v option."""
"""Say, we want to enlist those entries of students who have not passed."""
We can also store this result in another file.
"""For this, type: grep space minus iv space within double quotes pass after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt space greater than sign space notpass.txt"""
"""To see the content of the file, type: cat space notpass.txt ."""
Press Enter.The output is displayed.
"""Now, at the prompt, type:"""
grep space minus i space within double quotes fail after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt and press Enter.
This will include those students who are failed but their result is incomplete.
"""If we want to see the line number in the file at which the enlisted entries are, we have the minus n option."""
Let us clear the prompt.
"""Now, type: grep space -in space within double quote """"fail"""" after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt"""
The line number is displayed.
The patterns so far have been of single word.
We may have multi-word patterns as well.
But the entire pattern must be within quotes.
"""So, type: grep space minus i space within double quotes ankit space saraf after the double quotes space grepdemo.txt"""
We see that Ankit Saraf's record is displayed.
We can also find patterns in multiple files.
"""For this, type: grep space minus i space within double quotes fail after double quotes space grepdemo.txt space notpass.txt"""
Press Enter. The output is displayed.
"""With multiple files, grep will write the name of the file in which the entry was found. grepdemo.txt and notpass.txt."""
These are the records from notpass.txt file and these are the records from grepdemo.txt file.
"""Suppose, we may only want to know the number of matches or count ."""
"""For that, we have the minus c option."""
"""So, type: grep space minus c space within double quotes Fail  with a capital F after the quotes space grepdemo.txt"""
This will give us the count of number of lines matched.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt:"""
To see the content of a file e.g. cat filename
To list the entries of a particular stream e.g. grep “computers” grepdemo.txt
To ignore cases e.g. grep -i “computers” grepdemo.txt
Lines that do not match the pattern e.g. grep -iv “pass” grepdemo.txt
To list the line numbers with the entries e.g. grep -in “fail” grepdemo.txt
To store the result in another file e.g. grep -iv “pass” grepdemo.txt  notpass.txt and
To know the count e.g. grep -c “Fail” grepdemo.txt.

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Calling methods of the super class.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:   when to use the super keyword"""
How to call methods of the super class
How to invoke the constructor of the super class.
"""Here we are using: Ubuntu Version 12.04 ,JDK 1.7 ,Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have basic knowledge of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
You must also have knowledge of subclassing and method overriding in Java.
A subclass can use a superclass data or method using the super keyword.
"""The super keyword : refers to the instance variable of the parent class, is used to invoke parent class constructor, is used to invoke parent class method."""
"""Now, let us go to the IDE and to the project we created earlier."""
Let us go to the Manager class.
"""Now, come to the getDetails() method."""
"""In the return statement, let us remove Name and Email."""
"""Now, let us come to the Employee class."""
This is the parent class or super class.
We already have a getDetails() method here.
This method returns the name and email.
"""So, we can use this getDetails() method in the Manager class."""
"""We will call getDetails() method from the Employee class, inside the Manager class."""
"""So, come to the getDetails() method  in the manager class."""
"""Inside the return statement, type: super dot getDetails() plus slash n Manager of  getDepartment()."""
"""Now, let me run the program."""
We can see that we get the Manager details. Thus we can call the method of superclass inside the subclass.
Now let us come to the  Employee class.
Let us include a constructor here.
"""So, inside the Employee class, type:  public space Employee  within brackets String name, String email_address ."""
"""Within curly brackets, type: this dot name is equal to name semicolon , this dot email_address is equal to email_address"""
"""Now, let us comment the setter and getter methods."""
"""Inside the getDetails() method-  instead of getName, type name , instead of getEmail, type email_address."""
A subclass inherits all of the methods and variables from a parent class.
Note that it does not inherit constructors.
"""But, constructors can call the non-private constructors of its superclass."""
We do this using the keyword super from the child class constructor.
We will see that now.
"""For that, come to the Manager class. We will include a constructor here."""
"""So, type: public space Manager within brackets String space  name comma String space email underscore address comma String space dept ."""
"""Then, within curly brackets, type: super within brackets name, email underscore address semicolon."""
Then type: department is equal to dept semicolon.
Here we will comment the setter and getter methods.
"""Then, in the getDetails() method type: department instead of getDepartment."""
"""Now, come to the TestEmployee class."""
Comment the call to the setter methods.
"""Now, inside the call to the Manager constructor, type: within quotes Nikkita Dinesh,  abc@gmail.com, Accounts."""
"""Now, run the program."""
We get the output as shown. We get the Manager details.
"""In this way, we can call the constructor of the super class."""
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt: the super keyword  ,calling the method of the super class and  invoking constructor of super class."""
As an Assignment-Open the previous assignment. Call the Vehicle class run method in the Bike class.
The output should be: The Vehicle is running. The Bike is running safely.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Align and distribute objects using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to:"""
Align and distribute various objects
Arrange objects in rows and columns
Set spacing between objects and  Create a tile pattern.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS, Inkscape version 0.48.4"
Go to Dash home and type Inkscape.
Now click on the logo.
Let me open an already saved Inkscape document.
Here we can see 5 different shapes placed randomly on the canvas.
"""On your Inkscape canvas, please draw 5 shapes and place them as shown here."""
"""Now, let us start aligning the objects."""
Go to Object menu and click on Align and Distribute.
The Align and Distribute dialog box opens on the right side of the interface.
Two types of positioning are available here.
Align is where the centers or edges of objects are aligned to one another.
"""Distribute is where objects are distributed in horizontal or vertical direction, based on their centers or edges."""
We can align objects in various manners using these options and their sub-options.
Here is another important feature: Relative to.
"""Using this, we can align the objects with reference to something."""
Click on the drop-down list to see the options here.
"""So, we have Last selected, First selected, Biggest object, Smallest object, Page, Drawing and Selection."""
"""By default, the objects will be aligned relative to Page."""
"""This means that the selected objects will respond to the Align and Distribute operations, according to your Page dimensions."""
Press Ctrl + A to select all the objects on the canvas.
The first 5 icons will align objects in the vertical direction.
Let me click on the first icon.
"""As the tool tip says, right edges of the objects are aligned to the left edge of the anchor."""
"""Please recall, here the anchor point is page, as the Relative to option is Page."""
Notice that 2 objects are overlapped now.
Overlap may occur based on the closeness of the objects in the previous arrangement.
We can correct this by clicking the Remove overlaps option which is below the Distribute option.
"""Now, the overlap is removed."""
"""To adjust the gaps between the objects, both in horizontal and vertical directions, use the H and V options."""
"""Now, click on the options under Align and observe how the objects align themselves."""
Use the undo option CTRL + Z to understand the alignment better.
The tool tips are quite useful to help understand the alignment.
The last icon works only on texts. So we will learn about that in another tutorial.
"""Next, we will adjust the gaps among the objects using the Distribute option."""
"""Since the objects are in vertical direction, we have to use the last four icons under the Distribute option."""
Let me align them to the centre first.
"""Now, click on the options under Distribute and observe how the objects align themselves."""
"""Once again, use the undo option CTRL + Z, to understand the alignment better."""
Refer to the tool tips to help understand the alignment better.
"""Under Relative to, observe there is an option Treat selection as group."""
This  will align the objects as a whole group.
Click on the check-box.
"""Now,  click on the icons one by one  and observe the objects are aligned as a group, and not individually."""
Let us uncheck the box.
"""Now, the objects will be aligned individually."""
"""Next, let us align and distribute objects according to Last selected."""
Change the Relative to option as Last selected.
"""So, bring all the objects inside the canvas and place them randomly."""
Select the objects one by one. Select the circle last.
"""As before, click on the icons one by one."""
"""Since the last selected object is circle, observe the objects are aligned according to the circle."""
"""Likewise, you can try out all the options listed in Relative to and observe the alignment of the objects."""
"""We will learn about the advanced options in Align and Distribute dialog box, in later tutorials."""
"""So, let us close this dialog box now."""
"""Next, we will learn to arrange the objects in rows and columns."""
Go to Object menu. Click on Rows and Columns.
The Rows and Columns dialog box opens up.
"""Using this option, we can arrange objects in rows and columns giving necessary spaces."""
Arrange the objects randomly on the canvas.
"""Now, let us arrange these objects in 2 rows and 3 columns."""
"""So, change the Row parameter to 2."""
"""Observe- when the Row parameter is changed, the Column parameter changes automatically."""
Click on Arrange button at the bottom right.
"""The Align option helps to align the objects in the right, centre and left."""
Check it one by one and observe the changes.
"""We can set the space between the objects, for both rows and columns, using the Set spacing option."""
"""Now, change the space parameter as 5 for both row and column."""
Click on Arrange button.
Observe the space between the objects.
"""Now, I will show how to create a pattern using Align and Distribute"""
I have a new Inkscape file with 4 squares of different sizes and colors.
Select all and rotate the squares so that they look like diamond shapes.
Open Align and Distribute dialog box.
Click on Centre on vertical axis.
Click on Centre on horizontal axis.
A tile pattern is now formed on the canvas.
"""Using these options creatively, we can form many unique patterns."""
"""Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learned to:"""
Align and distribute various objects
Arrange objects in rows and columns
Set spacing between objects and  Create a tile pattern.
Here are 2 assignments for you-
Create 5 circles having the following dimensions.
Arrange them randomly on the canvas and select all.
"""Using Align and Distribute, change Relative to option to Biggest object."""
Click on Align left edges.
Click on Centre on horizontal axis.
Create 6 squares of blue color and size of 100 * 100 pixels.
Select all squares and open Rows and columns.
Arrange them in 2 rows and 3 columns.
Set both vertical and horizontal space parameter to 20.
Your completed assignment should look like this.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on more on grep.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn"""
some more on grep commands
through some examples.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using:"""
Linux Operating System and
GNU BASH version 4.2.24
"""Please note, GNU bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial."""
As prerequisites-
you should know basics of Linux terminal.
You should be aware of grep.
"""For relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown: http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
We can match more than one patterns as well.
Then we have to use the hyphen e option.
I will use the same file grepdemo.txt.
"""Say, we want to find information for those who are either in civil or electronics."""
We need to type on the terminal:
grep space hyphen e space within double quotes electronics after the quotes space hyphen e space within double quotes civil after the quotes space grepdemo.txt
"""Say, you need to look into people whose title is choudhury."""
"""The problem is, different people spell their titles in different way."""
"""So, what is the solution?"""
"""In such cases, we can use hyphen e option with hyphen i."""
Type:  grep space hyphen ie space within double quotes chaudhury ('c'  'h'  'a'  'u'  'd'  'h' 'u'  'r'  'y') after the quotes space hyphen ie space within double quotes chowdhari ('c' 'h' 'o' 'w' 'd' 'h' 'a'
The output is displayed.
"""But, there can be many other ways in which we can write the names."""
How many hyphen e options can we give?
"""Obviously, there needs to be a better way and that way is through Regular expressions."""
A 'regular expression' provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text
"""such as particular characters, words or patterns of characters."""
There are a number of regular expression characters.
Let us see them one by one.
The character class-
It allows us to specify a group of characters within a pair of square brackets.
Only one out of this group of characters is matched.
Eg. [abc] would mean that this regular expression matches either a or b or c.
"""To match chaudhury, we may type at the prompt:"""
grep space hyphen i space within double quotes ch opening square-bracket ao closing square-bracket opening square-bracket uw closing square-bracket dh opening square-bracket ua closing square-bracket r openin
It still does not match choudhuree with double e.
If we want to specify a large range then we write:
First letter dash last letter of the range.
"""Suppose we like to match any digit, we simply write [0-9]."""
One out of this group of characters is matched.
The asterisk: The asterisk refers to 0 or more occurrences of the immediately preceding character.
"""For example, ab asterisk can match a,ab,abb,abbb etc."""
"""So, to match the students name whose name is Mira"""
We type at the prompt:
grep space hyphen i space within double quotes m opening square-bracket ei closing square bracket asterisk r a a asterisk after the quotes space grepdemo.txt
The dot regular-expression matches any one character.
"""Say, we want to search any words that are 4 letters long and starts with M."""
We would simply type:
grep space within double quotes M... space after the quotes space grepdemo.txt
"""Here, the space within the quotes is important as it would match 5 or more letter words."""
We may be specific about where in the line we want to search for our pattern.
It may be at the beginning of the line.
"""For that, we have the caret sign."""
"""Now, if we want to get those entries whose roll-numbers start with A."""
We know that roll is the first field in the file.
We type at the prompt: grep  space within double quotes caret-sign A after the quotes  grepdemo.txt
"""Similarly, to match a pattern at the end of the file, we have the dollar sign."""
"""To find stipends between 7000 to 8999, we have to write:"""
grep space within double quotes opening square bracket 78 closing square bracket ... dollar sign after the quotes space grepdemo.txt
Press Enter .
To match more than one pattern
To check a word that has different spelling
Character class The use of asterisk
To match any one character using dot
To match a pattern at the beginning of the file
To match a pattern at the end of the file.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Forums and Assignments in Moodle.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Different types of forums  How to add a forum for discussion and How to create Assignments"""
"""This tutorial is recorded using: Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04 Apache, MariaDB and PHP obtained through XAMPP 5.6.30 Moodle 3.3  and  Firefox web browser"""
"""You may use any web browser of your choice. However, Internet Explorer should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies."""
This tutorial assumes that Your site administrator has registered you as a teacher and  Assigned at least one course to you.
"""It also assumes that You have uploaded some course material for your course. If not, please refer to the relevant Moodle tutorials on this website."""
"""To practise this tutorial, you will need to add a student to your course."""
"""To know how to add a student, please refer to the tutorial Users in Moodle.I have already added a student, Priya Sinha, to my course."""
Switch to the browser and login to your Moodle site using the teacher login.
Click on the Calculus course in the left navigation menu.
Recall that we had added some course material and announcements earlier.
Let us understand what are Forums.
Forums can be used by teachers and students for discussions and to exchange ideas
Whereas Announcements are posted by teachers only
"""Teachers supervise these discussions, to ensure that guidelines are followed by all members"""
"""Now, we’ll learn how to add a forum. Switch to the Moodle page."""
Click on the gear icon at the top right and then click on Turn Editing On.
Click on Add an activity or resource link at the bottom right of the common section.
Scroll down and select Forum in the activity chooser.
Click on the Add button at the bottom of the activity chooser.
Forum name will display as a link to the forum on the course page.
I will type Interesting web resources on evolutes and involutes.
Description can be used to explain the purpose of the forum to the students. I will type the text as shown here.
Click on Display description on course page checkbox below this text area.
"""Next option is Forum type. By default, Standard forum for general use is selected."""
There are 5 forum types in Moodle. Click on the Help icon next to the drop-down to read about the types of Forums.
"""Depending on your requirement, you can choose the Forum type. I will select Standard forum displayed in a blog-like format."""
Scroll down and click on Save and display button at the bottom of the page.
"""We are brought to a new page. Here, click on Add a new topic button."""
I will type the Subject and Message as shown here. Rest of the options are similar to that of an announcement.
Scroll down and click on Post to forum button at the bottom of the page.
A success message is displayed.
"""Notice the message says that the author of the post can edit the post within 30 mins. This however, holds true only for non-teacher profiles."""
"""The teacher who is the moderator and creator of the course, can edit and delete any post at any time."""
I will now login as student Priya Sinha. We can then see how a student views this forum.
Click on the forum name in the list of resources to see the discussions.
"""As a student, I can either Add a new topic or Discuss this topic. Let me click on Discuss this topic link at the bottom right."""
"""Then click on the Reply link. I will add a comment, as shown."""
Scroll down and click on Post to forum button at the bottom of the page. You can see the comment has been added to the end of this thread.
"""Let me login as teacher Rebecca again, to see the comment posted by the student."""
"""Click on the name of the forum. Notice here, we can see 1 reply so far for this discussion topic."""
"""The actual message can be seen after clicking on Discuss this topic link, at the bottom right."""
"""There is another option here named as Split. If the teacher feels the reply deserves a separate discussion, she can split the discussion."""
"""Splitting a discussion creates a new discussion. The new discussion and later posts in that thread, will be moved to a new discussion thread. I will let it remain as it is."""
Let us go back to the Calculus course.
Next we will learn how to create an assignment.
"""Assignment in Moodle: can be submitted online, which saves paper  enables students to include media files like audio, video, powerpoint presentations, etc. And helps teachers to be unbiased by choosing to gr"
Let’s go back to the browser.
Turn editing on to add more resources
Click on Add an activity or resource link at the bottom right of the Basic Calculus section.
Double-click on Assignment from the list to add a new assignment.
"""Let me provide a name for the assignment, as shown here."""
"""Next, describe the assignment in detail and mention what the students are expected to submit."""
"""This is a simple formatted text editor, you can include tables, images, etc."""
You can copy the text I have typed here from the AssignmentResource.odt file.
It is available in the Code files link of this tutorial.
Scroll down to see the Availability section.
"""Next, we will specify the date and time from which submissions can be made. Ensure Enable boxes  checked."""
You can also use the calendar icon to select the date. I will set this as 25 Nov 2018.
Then I will set Due date as 15 Dec 2018.
Click on the Help icon to find out the meaning of Cut-off date and Remind me to grade by date.
Set them if required or disable if not required. I will disable them.
"""Uncheck Always show description checkbox.If this field is enabled,Then students can see the description of the assignment even before the Allow submissions from date."""
Next is the Submission types section. Decide if you want to allow students to submit online text or want them to only upload files.
"""I will check both Online text and File submissions. Depending on your requirement, you can choose either one or both the options."""
I will enable the Word limit and enter 1000 here.
"""You can specify the number of files each student can upload, as well. Additionally, we can specify the maximum file size and the types of files we will accept."""
"""Please note: This will override the maximum file size set by the admin, which is 128 MB, in our case."""
Click on the Help icon next to Accepted file types. Here we can read about the file types this field accepts.
"""I will type .pdf,.docx,.doc here."""
Review the fields under Feedback types and Submission settings.  You can enable or disable them based on your requirements.
I have chosen the settings as shown.
"""Now, scroll down and click on the Grade section to expand it."""
The maximum grade by default is 100. We will let this remain as it is.
Then I will enter the Grade to pass as 40. And set Blind marking to Yes.
"""This will hide the identity of the student from the evaluators. So now, as a teacher, I won’t know which student has submitted which assignment."""
"""Which invariably, helps me to be unbiased while grading."""
Please note that Blind marking setting cannot be changed for this assignment  after any submission is made.
There are various other settings for the assignment which you can explore on your own.
"""Now, scroll down and click on Save and display button."""
You can see some statistics about the assignment here. And a link to View all submissions and Grade.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt about: Different types of forums  How to add a forum and How to create Assignments"""
Here is a small assignment for you. Add a reply to the forum discussion created earlier. Split the discussion from this reply onwards.
Create an assignment that accepts only online text submissions. Refer to the Assignment link of this tutorial for details.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial of GIMP.
"""Before I start editing this image, I want to tell you in brief about using RAW for your real photography."""
"""If I had shot this image in JPEG, I would have had 256 steps of brightness for encoding it."""
"""You can see it’s nearly black and white, a bit bluish greenish tint and basically it’s only gray."""
"""And with JPEG, you have 256 different values of gray -"""
zero for black and 255 for white.
And in this image there is no white and only a bit black.
So only a small space of this room is used.
I’ll show you how much later.
I had shot this image in RAW and my camera stores RAW images in 12 bit data format.
This is the image I have got out of the RAW converter after spreading the values and here I have 256 different values of gray and now I can start to edit the image.
"""In this image, there are more details saved as compared to the first one."""
This is the first image I remember and this one I have got after conversion.
The second image is a good base for doing post processing which results in a picture which has the mood of the 1st image but looks better.
Now I have opened the two images in the GIMP. So let’s  have a look at the histogram of the 2 images.
The histogram is hidden in the image dialog.
"""But we have 3 different ways of reaching the image dialog, first way is on the tool bar."""
Second way is to click on Access  the image menu here and  click on dialogs.
"""And the third way is simply right click into the image, then Dialog and Histogram."""
Here’s the histogram of the first image.
Make it a bit bigger and here you see the distribution of different pixels of the different colors in the image.
Digital image is similar to painting by numbers.
"""When you zoom into the image, you see a lot of little tiles and each of these tiles has a different color which is called as a 'pixel'."""
And each color is defined by a value and I can show you these values here with the help of Color Picker.
"""When I use colour picker, I get the values for red, green & blue."""
"""In this image, the value of red is a bit less than green and blue."""
Green and blue have nearly and exactly the same value.
Painting by numbers is digital photography.
"""In this image here, I have numbers from 0 to 255 and we have a really dark part here but I don’t think it will make into the final image."""
"""I think, the real part of the image starts here  around 80 and the brightest part of the image is here at around 200."""
"""So, we have room from 0 to 256, but we only use 120  which is less than half of data which we could use."""
"""And because of that, a lot of information of the image is lost here."""
Let’s have a look at the histogram of the second image.
"""As we can see here, there is more data in this histogram as compared to first one but the form of the curve is identical."""
You compare these two histograms.
Details in the 2nd image is spread out. So the problem I have to solve here is to make the 2nd image compressed like the 1st one.
But it should have a bit more of  details and it should have a bit more of contrast like this one in the first image.
"""Before I start working with this image, I want to show you a thing that I found out about the GIMP user interface while recording the last tutorial."""
"""When you press tab into the image window, the tool-box here vanishes and helps me in getting the image as big as possible and I can switch the tool-box 'On' and 'Off' as per my requirement."""
So I can see it better what I am doing here and you can also see it better.
"""Before I start editing the image, I have to change some settings."""
"""So, I go to File, Preference and here I go to Window Management and choose the option here,"""
Keep above for the toolbox and Keep above for the docks and leave the rest of options as it is.
"""After I press OK, the GIMP works as advertised."""
I can select the tools from the tool box and get all options of the tool I have  selected.
I can click back into the image and use tab to switch the tool box on and off.
The first thing to do is to check if the image is leveled.
"""In this image, there are no reliable man made structures here. So I can’t use the grid method to check if the image is straight ."""
The surface of the water is a very good clue.
But we don’t see the horizon here and the streaks on the water are also a bit misleading.
"""This, here, is not the horizon but just a curve in the river."""
"""So, I don’t have a real clue where to set a ruler and check the horizon."""
I just have to rely on my eye which I don’t think is the worst way to do something in photography.
"""Now, I select the Rotate tool and I choose Normal Forward instead of Corrective Backward and I set in Preview as Image and not the Grid."""
"""Ok, click into the image."""
"""Here, in the center, there is a point called """"center of rotation"""" and around that point the image will be rotated."""
And here is the dialog where we can set the Angle about which we want to rotate the image.
Here I have a slider which can help me in rotating the image but you can see it is difficult to handle and I don’t think I have to tilt the image this much.
So let’s go back to zero here and now I just use the style here to rotate the image.
"""I think the image is bit tilted towards the right. So I have to rotate the image to the left i.e. counter-clockwise, so I have to get here negative values."""
"""So, I keep on changing the Angle till I get the correct and straight image."""
"""So, I set the angle for """"-0.25°""""."""
Pull this window in and click on rotate and wait for the result of this operation.
"""Next step: """"cropping""""."""
"""In the image, I want to have the ship, the water and these birds here."""
"""And I don’t want to have in the image is this grass here, this part here and I m really not sure if I want to have this bank of the river in my image."""
And I think I will crop this part of image because later I want to have the darkest part of the image.
"""i.e the birds here, the ship and then the trees, the bank behind the ship, and lastly the water and sky."""
And this part of the image is too dark.
I want to zoom into this part of the image as I want to include as much as possible the part of the river but nothing of the bank.
"""So, I zoom into the part of the image here by pressing the hot key Z."""
Here’s another bird flying.
"""So, I go to the left side and I pull over the ruler close to the bank and leave it here."""
And press Shift + ctrl + E which brings me back to the image.
Now I have to select the Crop tool and set some options in it.
I want the Fixed aspect ratio 2:1.
"""And in Preview, I set Rule of thirds for little bit of help which will provide me some helpful lines."""
"""Let me see, what all is included here."""
"""Here, it is a group of birds and single bird appears here."""
Now you can click the rulers away.
"""On the lower part of image, there is water but I think it’s not enough water in it and too much sky is included."""
I can lose this single bird up here because I want this group of birds to stay in the image.
Now I simply pull this down and I think this looks quite nice.
"""To check my work, I select Rule of thirds."""
"""My eye isn’t so bad because I divided the image into 3 different parts i.e the water, the trees and the sky."""
The ship is one of the point of interest.
This group of birds is second point of interest and this one is nice 1/9th of the image.
I think this will work; so I click into the image to crop.
Press tab and shift + ctrl +E to enlarge the image.
"""I think we have started very well with the cropping of the image and what else to do with this image, I will show you in the next tutorial."""
"""Before I say good bye, I should save the image which I should have done much earlier."""
I save the image as Fog.xcf and ‘xcf’ is the extension of GIMP’s own file format and it contains lot of helpful information of layers and undo information and much more from the GIMP.
I would like to hear from you.
"""Tell me what you liked, what I could have made better by mailing me on to info@meetthegimp.org."""
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project ."""
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on methods in  java.
To create a method.
And to call a method.
"""Here we are using,Ubuntu version 11.10"""
Java Development kit 1.6 and
Eclipse 3.7.0
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know how to write, compile and run a simple java program in eclipse."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org"""
A java method is a collection of statements that performs a specified operation.
Let us now write a method.
"""So, in the eclipse, I have already created a project Methods."""
"""In the project, I have created a java class named MethodDemo."""
"""In the class, outside the main method, we will write a method."""
"""So, type: void name of the method"""
Let us name it as displayMessage parentheses Enter.
And curly brackets.
A method can  return a value.
But if you don’t want the method to return a value then the keyword void is used.
"""Alright, now inside the curly brackets, let us print a message."""
"""So, type: System dot out dot println Hello Method."""
"""So, we have written a method."""
"""Now,  we will call this method."""
"""So, inside the  main method,  we will  create an object of the class MethodDemo."""
"""So, MethodDemo object name."""
Let's name it as md =new  MethodDemo parentheses semicolon.
"""So, we have created an object md of the class MethodDemo using the new operator."""
"""Now, let us call the method displayMessage."""
"""So, type: md dot displayMessage();."""
The 'dot' operator is used to call the method.
"""Now,  let us Run this application by clicking on Run icon."""
We see the output Hello Method on the console.
"""Now, let us return an integer  instead of void."""
"""So, type: int."""
"""Also, make the method public, that is accessible everywhere."""
"""By default, it is private, that is accessible only within the class where it is written."""
"""Now, inside the method, type return seven semicolon."""
Remember that we write  the return  statement  at the end of all statements in the method.
This is because after return statement no other statements are executed.
"""Now, inside the main method, at the end, type the 'print' statement."""
"""So, type: System dot out dot println();"""
"""Within parentheses, we will call the method."""
"""So, put md dot method inside the parentheses, remove the semicolon."""
This will print the return value of the method.
Run the application.
"""We see in the output, the value 7 is printed."""
Now we will write another method and call this method in displayMessage.
"""So, type: public void  method name  square  within  parentheses  int a."""
"""Here, we are giving int a as a parameter to our method."""
"""Now, within curly brackets type: System dot out dot println within parentheses a into a."""
"""So, we have written a square method"""
that will display a square of an integer which is  given as a parameter.
Let us call this method in the displayMessage method.
"""So, type: square within parentheses an integer 5 semicolon."""
Run this application.
We see that the output displays the square of 5 that is 25.
"""Now, let us understand the flow of the application."""
The starting point is the main method.
"""In the Main method, we have first called the displayMessage."""
"""So, the control goes to the displayMessage"""
and all the statements in the displayMessage are executed.
The first one is the print statement.
Then it comes across the square method.
So the control jumps to the square method.
The square method takes an integer 5 and returns the square of the integer i.e. 25.
Then the control goes back to the displayMessage.
And it returns the value 7.
Then the control jumps back to the main  function.
"""Since there are no statements left to execute, in the main method, the application terminates."""
Alright! Now let us  make displayMessage as static.
"""So, after public type static."""
We see that we cannot call a 'non static' method inside the static  method.
"""So, we will comment this call."""
"""Since main is a static method, we can call the static  displayMessage inside this."""
"""Now, for static method, we do not need to create  an  object."""
"""So, we will comment this object creation."""
Also  we will delete md.
Run the application.
We see the output Hello Method and 7.
We do not see  25 because we have commented the call to square method.
We can also call method from other class.
"""For that, I have created a class Demo."""
"""Inside the class, create a method."""
"""So, type: public void show parentheses Enter."""
"""Inside curly brackets, System dot out dot println"""
I am from other class.
Save the file.
Go back to MethodDemo class.
"""Now we will call this show method, inside the method MethodDemo class."""
For that we need to create the object of the class Demo.
This is because the  show  method belongs to the class Demo.
"""So, type: Demo d=new Demo parentheses semicolon."""
Then call the method show.
Lets Run this application.
We see on the console: I am from other class.
This is how methods are used in java.
The method name and the parameters form the signature of the method
while  the curly brackets and the statements form the body of the method.
"""So, in this tutorial, we have learnt:"""
To create a method
To call a method
And different signatures of methods.
"""For self assessment, create a method which prints the cube of an integer."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Introduction to Arrays.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how  to create arrays and  access elements in arrays."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10 JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of data types and for loop in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown."""
Arrays are a collection of data.
"""For example, a list of marks, a list of names, a list of temperatures, a list of rainfall."""
"""Each item has an index, based on its position."""
The index of the first element is 0.
The index of the  second element is  1 and so on.
Let us now see how to store this data.
So switch to Eclipse.
A class named ArraysDemo has already been created.
"""Within the main method, let us add the rainfall data."""
"""So, inside main function, type:"""
"""int rainfall open  and 	close square  brackets equal to within curly brackets type 25, 31, 29, 13, 27, 35, 12 and finally the semicolon."""
Note that the square braces after the variable name rainfall.
This declares rainfall as an array of integers.
The braces are used to specify the elements of the array.
Let us now access data.
"""So on the next line, type:"""
System  dot out  dot  println rainfall in square brackets type 2.
We are printing the element with the index number 2.
"""In other words, the third element in the array i.e. 29."""
Let us save and run the program.
"""As  we can see, the output is the third element, i.e 29."""
"""Now, let us type 0 in place of 2."""
Save and run the program.
"""As we can see, the output is the first value i.e 25."""
"""Now, let us modify the value of the first item."""
"""So, type: rainfall[0] = 11;"""
"""Now, let us see its value. So save and run the program."""
"""As we can see, the value has been changed to 11."""
"""Now, what if we  know only the size of the array and do not know the values."""
Let us see how to create such array.
Remove everything in main function and type:
int squares[] = new int[10];
This statement creates an array of integers having 10 elements. The name of the array is squares.
"""Now, let us add some values to it."""
"""So, type:"""
squares[0] = 1;
"""Next line, squares[1] = 4;"""
"""Next line, squares[2] = 9;"""
squares[3] = 16;
"""So, we have entered the squares of first four numbers."""
Now what about the other elements of the array. Let us see what they contain.
"""So, we shall print the sixth value in the array."""
Type: System S capital .out.println(squares[5]);
Save and run the program. We see that the value is zero.
"""This is because when we create an array of integers, all the values are initialized to 0."""
"""Similarly, an array of floats will have all its values initialized to 0.0."""
"""It would be a long process if we have to type each value into the array. Instead, let us use a for loop."""
"""So, type: int n, x ; for(x = 4; x  < 10; x = x + 1){ n = x + 1; squares[x] = n * n; }"""
"""So, we iterate over numbers from 4 to 9 and set the corresponding element in the array."""
"""Now, let us see the output."""
"""As we can see, we are printing the  value of sixth element in  array. So, Save and run."""
We see the sixth element is now square of 6 which is 36.
"""In fact, now we can set all the values inside the for loop."""
Remove the lines that set the values manually and change 4 to 0.
"""This way, all the elements from index 0 to 9 are set to the corresponding squares."""
We shall now see the value of the third element.
"""So, change 5 to 2."""
Save and run.
"""As we can see, the value of the third element has been set in the loop and it is 9."""
"""This way, arrays can be created and used."""
We have come to the end of this tutorial.
To declare and initialize an array.
And access an element in an array.
The assignment for this tutorial is:
"""Given an array of integers, find the sum of all the elements in the array."""

Choose the minute and second where you have the question. Explain your question briefly.
Someone from our team will answer them.
"""Welcome to Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
Today I have something new to show you.
There is a new video by Joseph and today he is going to show you how to make an image using the sketch effects.
Hi! My name is Joseph and today I am going to show you how to create a sketch effect using gimp 2.4.
"""To show you the sketch effect, I am going to work with the Layers."""
"""The next thing that I am going do is to rename these layers, So that I can get an idea about which layer I am working on."""
"""So, I select the top layer and then go to Filters >> Blur >> Gaussian Blur."""
I move around in the image with the help of the Preview to get a spot where we can see some lines.
And Blur Radius is very important here.
I have created 2 previews here to show you the differences you  get using 30 Blur Radius and 5 Blur Radius.
"""For this image, I will keep the Blur Radius as 15 and click on OK."""
Now we have got a nice blur on the top layer.
"""So, the next thing we need to do is to invert the colours."""
"""So, go to Colours >> Invert."""
"""Now we go back to our tool box, select the top layer and set its Opacity to 50%."""
And we get a nice gray image.
Now we will merge these two layers together by right clicking on the top layer and select Merge Visible Layers and click on Merge.
The next thing I want to do is to increase the contrast in the image and to do that I select the Levels Tool.
As you can see that most of the information in this image is in the middle.
And I have to slide the sliders to that value.
Now I slide the middle slider to the left so that I get the image a little whiter.
and click on OK.
And now you can see that the lines are started to come out but we still got some colours in the image.
"""So, I go to Colours >> Desaturate and select Luminosity option and now we have got a black and white image."""
"""Now, I select again the Levels Tool and adjust the slider to get more contrast in the image."""
Adjust the sliders in such a way that you get a good contrast in the image.
I think this is good.
"""So, now we have got an image with a good sketch effect."""
I think we should make a border to this image.
"""So, I create a new layer, name it as white and select Layer Fill Type as White and temporarily I decrease the value of opacity so that we can see through the image."""
Now I select Rectangle selection tools from the tool box and draw a rough selection into the image.
And adjust the rectangle.
"""Once we are finished with adjusting the rectangle, go down to the left corner and click on Toggle Quick Mask and we get a black and  white border which can be edited."""
"""We can use Filters to create some interesting effects. So, I go to Filters >> Distorts >> Waves."""
And in this box you can see that there are lots of options for creating some interesting borders.
I adjust the sliders so that I get a little wave.
That looks good.
Now I want to add some Blur.
"""So, go to Filters but I think I should use some different effect."""
"""So, I go to Noise and choose Spread and I set the Horizontal to 22."""
"""So, now go to the Toggle Quick Mask button and click on it."""
"""And you can see here, there are margins area which means that we got a selection."""
Now I am going to add a layer mask to that layer and fill it with white for full opacity and there is a selection in the image. We can drag black colour into that selection and make our area there completely
"""I go to Select >> None, go back to the layer that we had temporarily set transparent and we will increase the opacity to 100%."""
"""Later on if you want to change the colour of your border, all you have to do is to go to the Colour dialog, select a colour and drag in that layer and you get a different coloured layer."""
That was a nice sketch effect and thank you Joseph for this video.
Now let’s look what has happened there.
I have prepared here an image and I have here a gray gradient from black to white and a area filled with white and black.
And I have already doubled the layer which is the first step.
"""Now I want to invert this image. So, go to Colours >> Invert."""
You see that this image is now exactly the opposite and I reduce the Opacity to 50%.
"""And the whole image is gray that’s because, half of black plus half of white gives gray."""
"""And here, half of white plus half of black also gives gray."""
"""So, next step is to Blur this layer."""
"""So, go to Filters >> Blur >> Gaussian Blur."""
I have unblocked this chain here so that I can change only the Vertical blur and not Horizontal blur because the image will get very confusing.
"""So, this is my desired result and I click on OK."""
Now you see here dark gray and light gray lines.
These lines here are the result of blurring of the foreground.
"""When I zoom in here and enhance the Opacity you see here black, white and in between there is a gradient."""
On the other layer we have white and black and now it’s not the exactly opposite.
"""So, decrease the Opacity and now you can see that on one side it's dark gray and on the other side its medium gray."""
Here it's medium gray and here also.
But first let’s look at the trick of the eye.
"""Here it's definitely darker than this one here. So, I select the Colour Picker and we can see that here it is 128, 128, 128 for Red, Green and Blue and 50% gray and it's medium gray and here it's 127, 127, 1"
"""Here, there are little shades which is basically the same colour and we have 127 on this side and 128 on this side."""
If we divide 255 by 2 we get either 127 or 128 if you have no floating point.
"""Now, I have to merge these layers."""
"""So, go to Layer >> Merge down."""
"""So, here get the colour level that Joseph  had in his image and now I can just pull these sliders and make black darker and gray whiter."""
You can see a line of variable thickness and if I pull these sliders to left then line gets finer and finer.
"""So, let's look at the whole image, Shift + Ctrl + E and you see here I have lines instead of the gradient and colour fills I had before."""
I hope you  understand this and you can try doing it.
Some images look very good with this effect.
And Joseph’s image was so funny. I love it.
This week I start a new segment at Meet The GIMP.
If you go to the Home page and down there on the right side you find the way to 'Photo group at 23HQ.com'.
And there are lot of your images which I show and from week-week I will  take one of them and say something about it and today I will take this one here.
It is made by Mainzelmann at the fireworks and he asks for comment regarding the white balance and the colours in this image and I think its worth looking it.
I have commented but that was only in German.
Ok. Let’s have a look.
This is his image simply pulled off from the website and dropped here on the tool box and then GIMP opens the image from the web.
I think the sky has to get little darker.
"""The building here at the bottom is great, that has to stay in the image. But the sky here should be nearly black, not really black like this and perhaps some of this smoke clouds here can be saved."""
"""So, I select the Curves Tool and let’s see what we can do."""
"""You can see here that we have a lot of white colour in this image, here."""
"""The exposure in this image is very good and the values are very well distributed in the histogram and we have black here, you see that's not really black."""
We can make this a bit darker here.
"""So, I can pull this black point up to here."""
The black point is definition of black and I now can say this is black.
"""So you can see that it's the firework, a bit more prominent and I want to make this part of the histogram a bit darker."""
"""So, I place a point here and just pull the curve down."""
I have to leave a bit of room here for the building.
I think this is the important part of the building.
"""So, I pull the curve down here and I can see the building is still there."""
"""Now, this area here is dark and this white; perhaps this is now a bit too white. So I just pull this down."""
Let's try something strange.
"""No, that doesn't work."""
Just pull the points out.
I haven't tried this before so little bit of experimenting.
I think this works.
At first looking at the image to make it a bit warmer but now the colours come out very good.
I think this is it for this image.
"""For more information go to http://meetthegimp.org and if you want to send a comment, please write to info@meetthegimp.org. Good bye."""
"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Redirection Pipes.
I am using Linux Operating System.
We assume that you already have an idea about the Linux operating system and have some basic idea about commands.
"""If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial on the following website."""
Also note that Linux is case sensitive .
Most of the work that we do in Linux is through a terminal.
"""When we have to execute a command, we generally type through the keyboard."""
Say we have to find the date and time.
We simply type through the keyboard date and press Enter.
"""So, we normally give input through the keyboard."""
"""Similarly, we see that the output of our command is also displayed at the terminal window."""
"""Also, say some error occurs while we are executing some command."""
For example we type cat space aaa And press enter.
"""Now, no such file by the name 'aaa' exists."""
"""So, there is an error displayed saying so."""
Now this error also comes on the terminal window. Hence we see error reporting is also at the terminal.
"""Now inputting, outputting and error reporting are the three special actions related to commands."""
Before learning about redirection we should know about two important concepts. That of stream and file descriptor.
"""A Linux shell like Bash, receives input and sends output as sequences or streams of characters."""
Each character is independent of the one before it and the one after it.
Streams are accessed using file IO techniques.
"""It does not matter whether or not the actual stream of characters comes from or goes to a file, a keyboard, a window etc."""
"""In Linux, every open file of a process is associated with an integer number."""
These numeric values are known as file descriptors.
Linux shells use three standard I/O streams.
Each of them is associated with a well-known file-descriptor.
stdin is the standard input stream.
It provides input to commands.
It has file descriptor 0.
stdout is the standard output stream.
It displays output from commands. It has file descriptor 1.
stderr is the standard error stream. It displays error output from commands. It has file descriptor 2.
Input streams provide input to programs.
"""By default, it takes from terminal keystrokes."""
"""Output streams print text characters, by default to the terminal."""
The terminal was originally an ASCII typewriter or display terminal.
But is now more often a text window on a graphical desktop.
We have seen that the 3 streams are connected to some files by default.
"""But in linux, we can change this default behavior."""
We can connect these 3 streams to other files.
This process is called Redirection.
"""Now, let us see how redirection is done in the 3 streams."""
"""First, let us see how the standard input is redirected."""
"""We redirect standardin from a file, using the < (left angled bracket) operator. Let us see how."""
"""We know that the use of wc command is to find the number of lines, words and characters in a file."""
Type wc on the terminal window.
Now press Enter. What happens?? We have a blinking cursor. It means that we need to enter through the keyboard.
"""Enter some text say """"This tutorial is very important""""."""
Now press Enter.
Now press Ctrl and d keys together.
Now the command will work on the lines that we entered.
The command will give an output on the terminal.
Now here no file is given after wc command.
"""So, it takes input from standard input stream."""
"""Now, the standard input stream is by default connected to the keyboard. Hence wc will take input from the keyboard."""
"""Now, if we write wc space left-angled bracket space test1 dot txt."""
"""What happens is that wc will tell us the no. of lines, words and characters in the file test1 dot txt."""
Now type: wc space test1 dot txt.
We see the same result.
"""So, what is the difference?"""
"""When we write wc space test1 dot txt , the command opens the file test1 dot txt and reads from it."""
"""But when we write wc space left-angled bracket test1 dot txt, wc still does not get any file to open."""
"""Instead, it looks to pick up the input from standardin."""
Now we have directed  standardin to the file test1dot txt.
Hence the command reads from 'test1'.
"""But, actually it is unaware as to from where the data is coming to standardin."""
"""So, we have seen how to redirect standard input."""
"""Now, let us see how to redirect standard output and standard error."""
There are two ways to redirect output or error to a file:
"""Suppose, 'n' refers to the file descriptor, 'n' single right-angled bracket redirects output from file descriptor 'n' to a file."""
You must have write authority to the file.
"""If the file does not exist, it is created."""
"""If it does exist, the existing contents are usually lost without any warning."""
' 'n' double right-angled bracket' also redirects output from file descriptor 'n' to a file.
"""Again, you must have write authority to the file."""
"""If it does exist, the output is appended to the existing file."""
The 'n' in 'n single right angle bracket' or 'n double right angle bracket' refers to the file descriptor.
"""If it is omitted, then standard output i.e. file descriptor 1 is assumed."""
"""So, just a right angle bracket is same as 1 right angle-bracket."""
"""But, to redirect error stream, you have to use 2 right angle-bracket or 2 double right angle-bracket."""
Let us see this practically.
"""From the last example, we have seen that the result of the wc command on a file or standardin is displayed at the terminal window."""
What if we do not want to display this on the terminal?
"""We want to store it in a file , so that the information can be later used."""
"""By default, wc writes its output to the standardout"""
"""The standardout is, by default, connected to the terminal window."""
Hence we see the output in the terminal window.
But if we can redirect the standardout to a file then the output from the wc command will be written to that file.
"""Say, we write:  wc space test1 dot txt 'right-angled bracket' wc_results dot txt ."""
Press Enter.
"""Now, to see whether this is actually happened, we can display the contents of wc_results dot txt by the c-a-t command."""
"""Yes! it has.Suppose, we have another file test2 in the same directory."""
"""Now, we again execute the command with test2 file. We type: wc space test2 dot txt 'right-angled bracket' wc_results dot txt."""
"""So, the contents of the file wc_results would be overwritten."""
Let's see this.
"""Instead, if we write wc space test1 dot txt 'right-angled bracket' twice wc underscore results dot txt"""
"""the new contents will not overwrite the already present contents of the file wc underscore results dot txt, it will be appended."""
Let's see this too.
Redirecting the standard error is done similarly.
Only difference is that in this case we need to mention the file descriptor number of standard error before the right angle-bracket  or double right angle-bracket sign.
"""Like we know that their exists no file by the name 'aaa', write the following wc space aaa."""
"""The shell will give the error: """"No such file or directory""""."""
"""Now say, we don't want error messages on screen. They can be redirected to some other file ."""
"""For this, we may give the command  wc space aaa space 2 'right angled- bracket' errorlog dot txt."""
"""Now the error will not show on the terminal, rather it will be written in the file 'errorlog dot txt'."""
We can see this by the command cat space errorlog dot txt.
"""Now, suppose that I make some other error by running the command: cat space bbb space 2 'right angled- bracket' errorlog dot txt."""
The previous error would be overwritten and the new error will show.
See cat space errorlog dot txt.
"""But, what if we want to list all errors?? Simple! we would run the command: wc space aaa space 2 'right-angled bracket' twice errorlog dot txt."""
We check this using the cat command.
"""We have seen how the three streams standard out, standard in, standard error are redirected and manipulated separately. But the real power of this concept can be gauged when we can manipulate the streams tog"
This process is called pipelining.
Pipes are used to create chains of command.
A Pipe connects the output of one command to the input of the next command in the chain.
It looks like:  command1 vertical bar command2 hyphen option vertical bar command3 hyphen option1 hyphen option2 vertical bar command4
"""Say, we want to know the total number of files and directories present in the current directory."""
What we can do? We know ls space minus l will list all files and directories of the present directory.
We can redirect the output to a file.ls space minus l 'right-angled bracket' files dot txt.
Run cat space files dot txt.
"""Now, each line is a name of a file or directory ."""
"""So, if we measure the total lines in this file, we can use 'files dot txt' to serve our purpose."""
This we can do using the command: wc space minus  l files dot txt.
"""Though this serves our purpose, there are a few problems."""
"""First, we need an intermediate file, here files dot txt."""
"""If the first command produces a lot of data, it may unnecessarily eat away the disk memory."""
"""Also, if we want to chain several commands, this method is slow."""
We can do it much easily using pipes like this. We write: ls space minus l 'vertical bar' wc space minus l
and we can get the same result with much more ease.
The output from the ls command goes as input for the wc command.
We can add even longer chains of command using pipes.
One common use of pipes is for reading multi-page displays.
Type: cd space slash user slash bin.
"""So, we are now in bin directory."""
"""Now, run ls minus l."""
"""We cannot see the output properly. But if we use it joined with a pipe to more, we can."""
Press Enter to scroll through the list.
"""Press """"q"""" to come out of it."""
These were some of the commands that help us to work with files.
There are many more commands.
"""Moreover, each of the commands that we saw has many other options."""
I encourage you to see more about them using the man command.
The best way of learning commands is to use them again and again.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Nested if and Switch statements in C and C++.
"""In this tutorial we will learn,"""
how to use nested if statement and
switch statement.We will do this with the help of some examples.
"""Ubuntu operating system version 11.10,"""
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.
First we will learn how to write nested if and switch statements with an example.
I have already written the program.
Let’s have a look. In this program we will learn to check the range of integers.
Note that our file name is nested-if.c.
This is our Header file.
This is our  main() function.
Inside the main() function we have declared two integer variables 'x and y'.
Here we prompt the users to enter a number between the range of 0 to 39.
We take the value of y as input from the user.
This is our if condition.
"""Here, we will check whether y/10=0."""
"""If the condition is true, we print """"you have entered the number in the range of 0-9""""."""
This is our else-if condition.
Here we check that y/10 equals to 1.
"""If the condition is true,"""
"""we print  """"you have entered a number in the range of 10-19""""."""
In this else if condition we check whether the number is in the range of 20-29.
And here we will see that the number is in the range of 30 to 39.
This is our else condition.
"""If all of the above conditions are false,"""
"""we print """"number not in range""""."""
Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
"""To execute, type gcc space nested-if.c space hyphen o space nested. Press Enter."""
Type dot slash “nested” (./nested). Press Enter.
We see Enter a number between 0 to 39.
I will enter 12.
The output is displayed as:
you have entered the  number  in the range of 10-19.
Let us enter another number.
"""Let's execute again. Press the up arrow key, press Enter."""
I will give  5 this time.
We see the output as :
you have entered the number in the range of 0-9.
The conditional execution can also be done in another way.
By using switch statement.
Let’s see how it is done.
We will see  the same program using switch.
I have already opened the program.
Let's switch back to our text editor.
I have explained this in the previous program.
So I will move on to the switch statements.
"""Here, we divide the inputs i.e y  by 10 and the result  is  stored in  the variable x."""
That means the quotient will be stored in x.
With the help of the quotient we can identify the range of the number.
"""Here, we tell the switch command that the variable to be checked is x."""
This is case 0 . If case 0 is satisfied
then we print you have entered  the number in the range of 0-9.
We add break to come out of the loop if the case is satisfied.
We need to break the loop each time.
It is because only one condition can be true at a time.
This is “case 1”. “case 1” means “if the value of x is 1”.
We print you have entered a number in the range of 10-19.
This is   “case 2” .
Here  we print you have entered a number in the range of 20-29.
And this is case 3. Here we check whether the number is in the range of 30-39.
This is the default case. Default case specifies what needs to be done if none of the above cases are satisfied.
"""Here we print """"number not in range""""."""
And This is our return statement.
Let us execute the program.
Type gcc space switch.c space -o space switch. Press Enter.
Type ./switch(dot slash switch). Press Enter.
Enter a number between 0 to  39. I will enter 35.
The output is displayed as “you have entered the number in the range of 30 to 39”.
Now we will see how to execute the programs  in C++.
Switch back to the text editor.
Note that our file name is nested-if.cpp.
Here the logic and implementation are same.
There are a few changes like:
"""The header file as """"iostream"""" in place of """"stdio.h""""."""
Here we have included the using statement
Using namespace std.
And the  cout and cin function in place of printf and scanf.
You can see that the rest of the code is similar to our C program.
Let’s execute the code.
Type g++ space nested-if.cpp space -o space nested1. Press Enter.
Type ./nested1. Press Enter.
Enter a number between 0 to 39. I will enter 40.
The output is displayed as: “number not in range”
Now let’s see the switch program in C++.
Come back to our text editor.
Here also the logic and implementation are same.
You can see that the  header file is iostream.
Here is the using statement.
And we have changed the cout and cin function.
Rest of the code is similar to our switch.c program.
Let us execute.Come back to our terminal.
Type g++ space switch.cpp space -o space switch1. Press Enter.
Type ./switch1. Press Enter.
Enter a number between 0 to 39.
I will enter 25.
The output is displayed as:
“you have entered  the number in the range of 20-29”
Now let us switch back to our slides.
We will see the comparison between switch and nested-if statements.
Switch statement is evaluated according to the result of the expression.
Netsed-if statement is run only if the result of the expression is true.
"""In switch, we treat various values of the variable as cases."""
In nested-if we have to write the conditional statement for each value of the variable.
Switch statement can only check the integer values.
"""Nested if can check for both, integer and fractional values."""
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt * 'nested if' statement. e.g. else if( y/10 equals to 0)"""
switch statement. e.g. switch(x) and
Difference between nested-if and switch statements.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Java Interfaces.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Creating an interface"""
Creating  Implementation classes and  Usage of  Interface.
"""For this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 12.04 JDK 1.7 and Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
You should also have the knowledge of subclassing and Abstract classes in Java.
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
First let's understand what is an interface.
An Interface contains a set of abstract methods and static data members.
It defines the signatures of a set of methods without the body.
It is declared using the interface keyword.
Now we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called InterfaceDemo.
"""Here, we will create the necessary classes and interface to demonstrate the usage of interfaces."""
Right-click on src folder and click New > Interface.
Type the name as Animal and press Enter.
Note that the “interface” keyword is used for defining an interface.
Now type the code as displayed on the screen.
"""Here, the interface name is Animal."""
"""It contains three abstract methods talk(), see() and move()."""
All such methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract.
An interface can also contain constant variable declarations.
"""Here, the constant string value “Mammal” is assigned to the variable “type1”."""
And “Reptiles” is assigned to the variable “type2”.
"""All constant values defined in an interface are implicitly public, static and final."""
Next we will see implementation class for an interface with an example.
"""Here, Human is a class which implements the Animal interface."""
"""So, it must provide implementations for the methods talk(), see() and move()."""
A class can also implement multiple interfaces.
"""As shown in the example, the class Human implements two interfaces Animal and Action."""
Note that a comma operator used in the syntax is to identify the different  interfaces.
Now this class should provide implementations to all the abstract methods in both Animal and Action interfaces.
The figure here represents an implement relation.
The Animal class is an interface.
The Human and Snake classes are the two implementation classes.
"""The Human class provides its own different implementations for talk(), see() and move() methods."""
"""And, the Snake class provides its own different implementations for talk(), see() and move() methods."""
Let us understand the usage of interfaces with a sample program.
Right-click on the default package and create a class called Human.
"""Now, to make this an implementation class of Animal, type: implements Animal."""
"""Now, we can see an error comes up in the Eclipse IDE."""
This error indicates that we should provide an implementation to the Animal interface.
Let us see how to rectify this error.
"""Now let us define the methods talk(), see() and move()."""
"""So, type: public void talk( ) within curly brackets type System.out.println within quotes """"I am a human and I belong to""""."""
"""Now we can use the value of the static, final variable type1 declared in the Animal interface."""
"""So, type: + Animal.type1+ within quotes """"family"""" semicolon."""
Let us now implement the see() method.
"""So, type: public void see( ) within curly brackets type System.out.println within quotes """"I can see all colors"""" semicolon."""
We should also define the move() method.
"""So, type: public void move( ) within curly brackets type System.out.println within quotes """"I move by walking"""" semicolon."""
"""Note that the error disappears, once all the methods are implemented."""
Next we will see how to define the Snake class.
I have already created it in my project.
Please create the snake class in your project and type the following code as displayed on the screen.
Now let us go through the code.
"""We can see that all the methods of the Animal interface- talk(), see() and move() are implemented inside this class."""
"""Here, the talk() method prints “I am a snake and I belong to”."""
Then the value of Animal.type2 is to be printed and then “family”.
"""Here, the see() method prints “I can see only in black and white”."""
"""The move() method prints """"I move by crawling""""."""
"""Note that the Human class has its own implementations of talk(), see() and move() methods."""
"""And, the Snake class has its own implementations of talk(), see() and move() methods."""
"""Now, right-click on the default package, click new >  class and then type the name as Demo."""
"""Inside this class, we will have the main method."""
"""So, type main and then press ctrl+space to generate the main method."""
Type the following code as displayed on the screen.
"""In this line, we instantiate the  Human class using the Animal interface."""
This is represented as Animal h equals new Human();
Now we can invoke the different methods using this object as h.talk(); h.see();   h.move();
"""Next, we instantiate the Snake class using the Animal interface."""
Now we can invoke the different methods using this object as shown.
"""Now, let us run this Demo program."""
"""So, right-click on the class  Demo and then select Run as > Java Application."""
We can see the output.
"""These are printed by the talk(), see() and move() methods invoked using the human class object h."""
"""These are printed by the talk(), see() and move() methods invoked using  the Snake class object s."""
"""Now, let us explore the differences between an interface and an abstract class."""
All the methods in an interface should be abstract.
"""Within interface, there should not be any  constructors,"""
"""concrete methods,  static methods and main method."""
But an abstract class can have all these inside it.
The variables in an interface should be static and final.
There are no such restrictions for an abstract class.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about: * Creating an Interface"""
* Creating an implementation class and
* Usage of interfaces.
"""As an assignment, create an interface Vehicle which contains the methods brake() and run()."""
"""Create another interface Fuel which contains the following methods.   fill(String type,int quantity), pay(int quantity,int price)."""
Create a subclass Car which implements both interfaces Vehicle and Fuel.
"""Here, brake method should print """"Car Applies Power brake""""."""
"""And the run method must print """"Car is running on 4 wheels""""."""
Similarly fill() method can print the type and quantity of the fuel filled.
For example: 10 Litres of petrol.
pay() method can be used to print price to be paid. For example: Pay Rs. 640
Create another subclass Bike which again implements both the interfaces Vehicle and Fuel.
"""Here, brake method can print """"Bike Applies hand brake""""."""
And the run method can print “Bike is running on 2 wheels”.
"""Next, implement the fill() and pay() methods as explained earlier."""
Finally create a Demo class containing the main method to verify the results.
This video at the following link summarizes the Spoken Tutorial Project. Please download and watch it.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Special Effects on Text using Inkscape.
In this tutorial we will learn to create Reflected text Labeled text and Change the case of the text
"""To record this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS"""
"""All the previous tutorials in this series, were recorded in 0.48.4"""
"""From this tutorial, I will record in the version 0.91, which is the latest stable version."""
"""Let us open Inkscape.  First, we will learn to create a reflected text."""
Select the Text tool and type the word SPOKEN. Make the text bold.
"""Let me zoom in to the text, so that we can see the demo clearly."""
"""Now, go to Object menu and select Fill and Stroke option."""
"""Then, under the Fill tab, click on Linear gradient."""
Click on the gradient handles as shown now and change the gradient colors to red and blue.
"""Align the gradient vertically. So now, the gradient should be red at the top and blue at the bottom, as shown on the screen."""
Click on the Selector tool and press Ctrl + D to duplicate the text.
"""Now, press V on the keyboard, to flip the duplicated text."""
We can also use the option available on the Tool controls bar to flip.
"""Now, we will move the duplicated text below the original text such that it appears as a mirror image."""
"""Now, select the Gradient tool and click on the bottom gradient handle."""
"""Come back to the Fill and Stroke dialog box.  Here, we will change the Alpha value to 0."""
"""We will also move the bottom handle a bit, in the upward direction."""
"""Click on the Selector tool. Now, reduce the Opacity to 80 and press Enter."""
Our reflected text is complete now.  Zoom out a little to see it better.
"""Next, we will learn to create a labeled text."""
"""First of all, we will create a rectangle in green color. Since the Alpha value is zero, it is not visible now."""
Change it to 255 and press Enter.
"""Now, type the text “SPOKEN TUTORIAL” on the rectangle."""
Click on the Selector tool and change the size of the rectangle according to the text.
"""Next, select the text. Now, press Ctrl + D to duplicate the text."""
The duplicate text is exactly above the original text.
"""Change the color of the text to white, then go to Path menu and click on Object to path option."""
Now click on Object menu and then on Ungroup option.
Again go to Path menu and click on Union option.
"""On the Tool controls bar, click on Lower selection one step icon."""
"""Once again, go to Path menu and this time we will click on Linked offset option."""
Click on the handle that appears on the text and drag it to make the outline bigger.
Click on the Selector tool. Then click on the text and move it down.
"""Observe, there is another text created.  Select the text and delete it."""
"""Now, select the outline part and click on the Nodes tool."""
"""On the Tool controls bar, click on Convert selected object to path tool."""
"""Now you can see the nodes on the outline. Select the unwanted nodes in the middle and delete them, as demonstrated here."""
Click on the Selector tool again and move the text back to its original position.
Change the color of the text to green.
"""Select the outline part and press Ctrl + D to duplicate it. Once again, remember that the duplicate outline is exactly above the original."""
Change the color to black.
"""Then on the Tool controls bar, click on Lower selection one step icon three times."""
"""Lastly, in the Fill and stroke dialog box, decrease the opacity to 60 and increase the blur to 7."""
"""After doing this, we will make a hanger for the label."""
"""So, click on the Ellipse tool. Then press Ctrl key and draw a circle on the top left of the rectangle, so as to make a hole on the label."""
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the circle.And move the circle to the other end of the rectangle.
"""Next, click on the Bezier tool and draw a curvy line, as demonstrated."""
The line drawn should look like a hanger.
"""On the Fill and stroke dialog box, under Stroke style, change the width to 5."""
Now our labeled text is ready. Let us zoom out and have a better look at it.
"""Next, let us learn how to change the case of the text in Inkscape."""
Click on the Text tool and type alphabets on the canvas. Notice that the entire text is in lower-case.
"""Now, go to Extensions menu and click on the option named Text and then on Change Case. You will see some options."""
Let me click on the option UPPERCASE. Observe that the case of the text alphabets has changed to upper-case.
"""Again click on the text. Go to Extensions menu,  then on Text and lastly on Change Case."""
"""This time, select Random Case option.  Observe the change in the case of the text."""
You can try the other options on your own.

Welcome to this brief tutorial on creating references using LaTeX and BibTeX.
What you first need to do is to create a database of references as in this file 'ref.bib'.
Let’s go down this file and let's go back to the top.
"""Each of these references begins with a unique key word. For example, the key word for this reference is KMM07."""
"""In the LaTeX file, let me open the LaTeX file, at the place where you want to use a reference, give the command 'cite key word'."""
"""For example- cite key word, cite keyword, Look at this, cite KMM07, the first reference we saw in 'ref.bib'."""
The next thing you have to do is to include the name of the file that has the references in the source file.
"""Here, I have included it towards the end of this document – 'bibliography ref'. Recall that the references are in the file 'ref.bib'."""
"""Finally, you have to say what bibliography style is to be used."""
That is included at the top of this source file.
This command 'bibliography style plain'.
"""Suppose that we use plain style here, the following sequence of commands is to be executed to create the references in the plain style."""
"""First, compile the source file using 'pdf LaTeX references'."""
Execute the command BibTeX references.
"""Third one, compile the source file, twice more, using pdf LaTeX references."""
Once. Twice.
"""The references are now created, let’s go and see."""
"""The second page, here is the text, here is the list of references. Let’s just go down."""
The plain style lists the references in alphabetical order and with numbering.
These numbers are used in the main text as well.
The referencing style 'u-n-s-r-t' is identical to the plain style but for one difference.
Put 'u-n-s-r-t' here.
References are listed in the order they are invoked first.
"""Let us change the plain to 'u-n-s-r-t', like the way we have done and then repeat the procedure of LaTeXing and BibTeXing. Which is, first, LaTeX the source file using pdf LaTeX, then BibTeX the source file"
Note what has happened now.
"""You can see that this has generated the references in the order they are cited in the paper. For example, this first reference is cited first here."""
Reference two is cited ‘2’ because it has been cited here.
It has been listed as second in this list.
Let’s just go down this list.
Okay. Let's come back.
"""To produce the references in the way the computer scientists use, change the style to 'alpha'."""
Let’s change this to 'alpha'.
"""Save and then repeat the LaTeXing and BibTeXing procedure. Which is, pdf LaTeX source file, BibTeX references, pdf LaTeX references once, twice. Note that."""
"""Now, we obtain this style of referencing."""
Let’s just go down this and see.
Okay.
There are many other styles of referencing. I have now downloaded two files: 'Harvard.sty' and 'ifac.bst'.
"""Make the following two changes. First, include 'Harvard' in the use packages command"""
like I do now and then change the style to 'ifac'.
Save the file.
"""Now, let’s do the LaTeXing and BibTeXing procedure once again."""
"""Latex, BibTeX, LaTeX once, LaTeX twice."""
We get the reference list as this pdf file.
Let’s just go down once.
It is alphabetically arranged but there are no serial numbers compared to the plain style.
The referencing is by author name and year; author name... and year.
"""In this style, there is a special command called cite-as-noun. That helps, put the name of the person cited in running text and not within brackets."""
Note that here we have used only cite and we have got all the references within brackets only.
"""Suppose for example,"""
"""look at this second paragraph.. The textbook by 'cite KMM07'. The textbook by.. the whole thing comes within the brackets. Suppose, I change this to 'cite-as-noun'."""
Save it and compile it.
"""As a result, now, this Moudgalya has come outside the bracket in running text."""
"""If you need some other referencing style, search the web."""
There are good chances that someone has already written the required 'sty' and 'bst' files.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Google Drive options.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about the options available in Google Drive like:"""
"""Creating a document, a spreadsheet and a presentation"""
Uploading files & folders and
sharing options.
"""For this tutorial, you will need a working Internet connection and any web browser."""
I will be using Firefox web browser.
"""As a prerequisite, you should have basic knowledge of Gmail."""
"""If not, please refer to the relevant Gmail tutorials on our website."""
Let's begin.
Open the web browser and log-in to your gmail account.
I have already done so.
"""On the top right, we can see a grid icon next to our name."""
"""When we move the mouse over it, the help text says Apps.Click on this."""
This will show us a few google apps like: google plus Search YouTube Maps PlayStore News Mail Drive Calendar and More.
"""If we click on them, we will be redirected to the particular google app."""
We can also rearrange this list based on our preference by dragging the apps icon to any other position.
"""In this tutorial, we will specifically learn about Drive."""
"""So, let me click on  Drive."""
This will open the Google Drive page in a new tab.
"""At the top of the page, we can see a Search bar."""
"""On the left, there are some menus."""
"""And on the top right, there are some icons."""
"""In the center, we can see two files."""
The first one was shared with us during account creation by the Google team.
The second one is the file which we ourselves uploaded earlier.
"""Now, let us have a look at the left side menus."""
We have the following menus: New My Drive Shared with me Google Photos Recent Starred and Trash.
"""By default, “My Drive” menu will be selected and its contents will be displayed in the center."""
All the files and folders will be displayed in the center area.
"""So, we can see the PDF and the ZIP file that we had uploaded in the previous tutorial, here."""
"""The files which are created or uploaded by us, will also be stored under “My Drive”."""
The next menu is “Shared with me”. Let me click on this.
"""If any one shares a file or document with me, it will be displayed under this menu."""
"""As of now, no one has shared any file with me. So, this is empty."""
Recently google has created a shortcut link to access the Google Photos within the Drive.
We will skip this option for this tutorial.
The “Recent” menu will display the list of files or documents which were opened recently.
It will display both the “My Drive” and “Shared with me” contents.
"""So, here we can see the pdf and zip files because we had opened them earlier."""
"""Starred- If we have marked any file or document as Important, that file will be displayed under this menu."""
Let us go back to My Drive menu and right-click on our pdf file.
"""Now, choose Add Star option."""
"""Next, click on Starred menu. Here is our file."""
Let me make a copy of this file.
"""So, once again, right-click on the file and choose Make a copy option."""
Now we have two files.
Let us delete one of them. Select the file and press the  Delete key on the keyboard.
Deleted files or documents will be displayed under Trash menu.
"""The deletion is temporary, however."""
We can delete all the files permanently from the Trash menu by selecting “Empty Trash” option.
"""All the files in the “Trash” menu, will automatically be deleted permanently from the google server after 30 days."""
"""Now, let us learn how to create and upload files and folders."""
There are 4 ways to do this: The first way is to click on the red colored “New” button on the left.
The second way: Right-click on “My Drive” option.
"""Now, let us come back to My Drive. In the “My Drive” option, we can right-click in the center area."""
"""Lastly, click on the “My Drive” drop-down menu at the top."""
Let us explore with the “New” option. Click on New button.
"""It will display some options like: Folder File Upload Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and More."""
"""We will see each option, one by one."""
We can create a folder using the “Folder” option.
Click on it. Immediately it prompts us for a name.
Let us name the folder as “Spoken Tutorial” and click on Create button.
"""By default, this folder will appear under “My drive”."""
"""We can see it here, in the centre area."""
Folders help us to organize our files better.
"""So, we can create separate folders. For example- personal, work etc."""
"""To upload any file- first click on “New” button, then click on “File Upload”."""
This will open a file browser window.
Browse and select the file that you want to upload.
I'll select “xyz.odt” file from the Desktop and click on Open button.
"""At the bottom right, we can see the progress of the upload."""
This may take some time based on the size of the file and the internet speed.
"""Once completed, the uploaded file will be displayed in the center area."""
"""Now, close the progress window at the bottom."""
"""In the same way, we can upload a folder on the Drive using the Folder Upload option."""
This feature may be available in certain browsers only.  For e.g. Google Chrome.
How can we move our uploaded file into our Spoken Tutorial folder?
"""Simply drag and drop the file into the folder, like this."""
"""Now, on the left side, look at My Drive option closely."""
Notice a small triangle to the left of it.
Clicking on it will show the sub-folders under “My Drive”.
"""See, here is our folder “Spoken Tutorial” and here is the file     'xyz.odt' inside it."""
"""For our day-to-day work, we use documents, spreadsheets and presentations."""
Is it possible to create and manage them on Drive?
"""Yes, it is. In Google Drive, we can create- documents, spreadsheets and presentations just like in any Office Suite."""
"""So, we have  Google Docs for creating documents,"""
Google Sheets for creating spreadsheets
and Google Slides for creating presentations.
"""For demonstration purpose, I will only show how to create a document using Google Docs."""
"""To create a new document, click on New button and select Google Docs option."""
This will open an empty document in a new tab.
We can see that the menus and text formatting options are the same as in any other  Office Suite.
"""At the top, notice that the document is titled as “Untitled document”."""
"""This is an editable title. To rename the title, click on the text."""
“Rename document” window opens.
"""Here, we can type a suitable title for our document."""
I will type “My first google doc” and click on OK.
Notice the change in the title.
"""Next, let me type some contents here, say- “Welcome to Google Docs”."""
"""Any addition, modification or deletion made to this document will be auto-saved."""
"""Look for the message “All changes saved in Drive”, next to the 'Help' menu at the top."""
"""If we click on that, we can see the “Revision History” on the right."""
It has the last modified date & time and also shows who made the modification.
"""As of now, this document is not shared with anyone."""
"""So, we can see only one user “Rebecca Raymond” with the date as Today and the time."""
"""If this google doc is shared with multiple people,  the revision history will list all the changes made by each user, with a unique color for each user."""
We will see this feature a little later in this tutorial.
Close the “Revision History”.
Let me close this tab. The google doc will be automatically saved.
"""Once again, we are in My Drive and we can see our file here."""
Double-click on it to open it again.
"""Now, we will copy-paste the line “Welcome to Google Docs” twice and then close the tab."""
Double-click on the file once again to open it.
"""Again, copy-paste the line “Welcome to Google Docs” once."""
"""Now, click on “Revision History”. We can see all the revisions of the file along with the date-time stamp and the user information."""
If multiple revisions are not seen then click on “Show  detailed revisions” button at the bottom.
The revisions are arranged in chronological order with the latest revision at the top.
Click on each revision and understand how this feature works.
Let me now share this document with two other users.
"""For this, click on Share button at the top right."""
Share with others dialog-box appears.
"""In the People text-box, we have to give the email-ids of people with whom we want to share this document."""
"""So, I will type: 0808iambecky@gmail.com."""
Note that the auto-fill feature is available here for email-ids to whom we had sent the emails earlier.
There are three modes in which we can share the document with other users.
Click on the button here to see these three modes: Can edit Can comment Can view.
"""Can edit option gives the other users, permission to make changes in the document itself."""
"""Can comment option gives the other users, permission to suggest changes."""
"""Can view option gives the other users, viewing permission only."""
They cannot make or suggest any changes.
Let us give Can edit option to 0808iambecky.
I will also add: stlibreoffice@gmail.com.
Remember to use a comma separator between two email-ids.
"""As soon as we enter the email-ids, there is a change in this window."""
We get “Add a note” text area.
If we want to send some information about this document to other users then we can type it here.
"""I'll type  “Please find attached a document for testing purpose. Kindly modify or suggest as per the permission given to you. Thanks """"Ray.Becky”"""
"""Lastly, click on Send button to complete the sharing process."""
"""This will send an email notification with our message and a link to the shared document, to other users."""
"""Once again, click on the Share button."""
Then click on Advanced.
"""Now, for the user 'stlibreoffice', we will change the sharing mode to Can comment."""
"""Lastly, click on Save changes button and then on Done"""
and close this document.
"""Now, assume that both the users made some modifications in the shared document."""
"""When we open the document again, after some time, we can find the edits made by the other shared users."""
"""Since stlibreoffice@gmail.com had only suggest permission, we can see the suggestions given by that user."""
"""Move your mouse to the suggestion box, over the check and cross marks."""
The check mark says Accept suggestion and the cross mark says Reject suggestion.
Let me accept one suggestion and reject the other.
We can see a comment here from 0808iambecky.
"""And here, we can see a Resolve button."""
"""The users with Can edit option, can reply to that comment by clicking on the comment text."""
"""To remove the comment thread, click on Resolve button."""
We cannot see any of the modifications made to the document by 0808iambecky.
"""Recall, this user had edit permission in the document."""
"""So, how can we find out what changes were made by that user?"""
"""For that, we can check our Revision History."""
"""To open it, we will click on File and then on See revision history."""
We can see that 0808iambecky made some changes and this is seen in a different color.
We can also see the suggestions given by stlibreoffice@gmail.com in a different color.
"""And of course, being the owner, we will see our own work in a different color."""
Let us close the Revision History window now.
There is another way to share a document. Click on Share button.
"""In the Share with others window, at the top right corner, we can see the text Get shareable link. Click on it."""
It says “Anyone with the link can view”.
This will create a link to this document.
"""Now, we can send this link to any email-id which means that anyone who has this link can view the document."""
"""With this, we come to the end of this tutorial."""
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to: access “Google Drive” Create and Upload files Create Google Docs and Use the sharing options."""
The video at the given link summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project. Please download and watch it.
"""We conduct workshops and give certificates for those who pass our online tests. For more details, please write to us."""
"""Spoken Tutorial project is funded by NMEICT, MHRD, Government of India. More information on this mission is available at this link."""
"""Dear friends, welcome to a spoken tutorial on the Linux Operating System."""
"""In this tutorial, we will study some basic commands."""
I am using Linux Operating System.
We assume that you know how to get started with the Linux operating system.
"""If you are interested, it is available through another spoken tutorial, on the website [1]."""
"""In this tutorial, we will see what are commands and what is a command interpreter."""
Then we will learn about how to find help in Linux using the man command.
"""Now the first question is, """"what are commands?""""."""
In simplest terms we can say that Linux commands are words that when keyed in cause some actions to take place.
"""Linux commands are seldom more than four character in length, like  ls, who, ps etc."""
The commands are in lower case and they are case sensitive. Let us see an example .
Go to the Applications menu.
Select Accessories and then click on Terminal from the available options.
Now we can see a prompt ($) and a cursor blinking next to it. This is where we need to type in a command.
Type the word who and press Enter.
We can see the name of the users logged in. Actually we have just executed a command called who which shows who are logged into the system.
But which entity is converting these commands which are nothing more than a few letters into actions?
"""This is the job of the Command Interpreter, also called the shell."""
"""We can define a shell as a program that acts as the interface between us and the Linux system,"""
allowing us to enter commands for the operating system to execute.
"""On Linux it’s quite feasible to have multiple shells installed, with different users able to pick the one they prefer."""
"""On Linux, the standard shell that is always installed as bin/sh is called bash, the GNU Bourne-Again Shell, from the GNU suite of tools."""
The commands we would be covering in this tutorial are generic and can run on most of the Linux shells with slight variations.
"""Nevertheless, we would be using the bash as the shell for demonstration in this tutorial."""
It is because bash is the most popular shell and portable to almost all UNIX.
"""Other shells include the Bourne shell which is the original  Unix shell, C Shell and the Korn shell."""
"""To see which shell we are using, go to the terminal"""
and type the command:  echo space dollar in capital SHELL and press Enter.
"""Normally, the output is /bin/bash which gives us the bash shell."""
There are ways by which we can activate different shells. Those will be covered in an advanced tutorial.
"""Commands are actually files containing programs, often written in C."""
"""These files are contained in directories. To find out where a command is stored, we can use the type command."""
Type at the command prompt:  type space ps and press Enter.
"""This shows that ps is actually a file, stored in the /bin directory."""
"""When we key in a command at the command prompt, the shell searches for a file matching the command name in a list of directories."""
"""If it is found, then the program corresponding to that file is executed, else a “command not found” error is given."""
"""The list of directories searched is specified by the PATH variable, as we will see later."""
"""For now, if we want to see this list, just type the command echo space dollar PATH  in capital."""
and press Enter.
"""Talking of commands, there is one important thing that we need to know."""
Linux commands are of two types: External commands and internal commands.
Now external commands are those which exist as separate files/programs.
"""Most commands in Linux are of this nature. But, there are some commands whose implementation is written within the shell and they do not exist as separate files."""
These are internal commands.
"""The echo command which we will see later, is in fact an internal command."""
Go to the terminal and type the command:
type space echo and press Enter.
"""The output shows: """"echo as a shell built-in""""."""
"""So, instead of giving a file name it shows that the echo command's implementation is internal to the shell. So, it is called internal command."""
Another important thing which we need to understand is the structure of commands.
"""Commands can be of one word or multiple words, separated by white spaces."""
"""In the second case, the first word is the actual name of the command while the other words are the arguments."""
Arguments can be options or expressions or file names.
A command can perform different tasks depending on the option specified.
They are generally preceded by a single or double minus sign called short and long option respectively.
Go to the terminal window and type the commands and see their outputs.
Type clear to clear the terminal window.
Then type ls and press Enter.
"""Again, type clear and press Enter."""
Type ls space minus a and Enter.
Type clear to clear the terminal window.
Now type ls space minus minus all and press Enter.
"""Again, type clear to clear the terminal ."""
Now type ls space minus d and press Enter.
"""At this point, it is enough to understand how the command's behavior changes with change of options."""
"""In Linux, we have a large number of commands"""
each of which have many different options.
"""Commands can also be combined together as we will see later. So, how do we keep so much in mind?"""
In reality you don't have to. This is because of the excellent online help facility available in Linux.
The man command provides documentation on just about every available command on the system.
"""For instance, to know about say- the ls command, all you have to do is to go to the terminal"""
"""and type man command with ls as argument, that is type man space ls and press Enter."""
Press q to come out.
"""man is the system’s manual pager. Each argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function."""
The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.
"""A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual."""
"""The default is to search in all of the available sections, following a pre-defined order and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections."""
You can use man command to know more about the command man itself.
Go to the terminal and type man space man and press Enter.
Press q to come out of it.
man command has many options.
"""Here, let me tell the most useful ones. Sometimes, we know what we want to do but we do not know the exact command. Then what can we do?"""
man provides the -k option which takes a keyword and returns a list of commands and their brief purpose.
"""For example, create a directory; we may not know the exact command."""
"""So, we can go to the command prompt and type man space minus k space directories and press Enter."""
Now we can search each of these commands to see what we actually need.
The same thing can be achieved using apropos command.
Type at the command prompt: apropos space directories and press Enter to see the output.
"""Sometimes, we do not need too much details. We only need to know what a command does."""
"""In that case, we can use the whatis command or man -f. Both give one line description about the command."""
"""Go to the terminal, type clear to clear the terminal window."""
"""Now, type: whatis space ls and press Enter."""
Some commands have many options. We may want to obtain a list of the different options that a command has.
Then we use the  - - (minus minus) help  option.
Go to the command prompt and type ls space - -(minus minus) help  and press Enter.
I will scroll up so that you can see all the options on this manual page.
"""That's it for this part of the Linux Spoken tutorial. Spoken Tutorials are a part of the """"Talk to a Teacher"""" project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT."""
More information on the same is available at the following link .
"""Welcome to the tutorial of Meet The GIMP. My name is Rolf Steinort and I am recording this in Bremen, Northern Germany."""
"""In the last tutorial, I showed something about the Drawing tools and some how the apply jitter button was lost."""
I remember doing that stuff but well it must have been gone during editing.
"""When I paint some lines here, you see it has a smooth corner and it looks like it is done with a pen."""
"""Now I Apply jitter and set the amount to let's say around half or so and you see, the paint brush jitters a bit and the border is not that even as it has been before."""
Let's increase the amount and now you can see the cloud of dots here which are distributed around the lines I have drawn.
And that’s the secret of the jitter button.
There is another correction to be made.
Hansen wrote to me that the Eraser tool has one important difference from the Pen or Brush.
"""To see it in action, simply paint something on a foreground layer, in transparency i.e with a Alpha channel on."""
"""A pen or brush with the background colour selected will paint in that colour but the Eraser will remove the colour, turning it transparent."""
"""Ok, let's try that."""
"""Black is my foreground colour and orange is my background colour and you can see the layer name is in bold, that means the alpha channel is not in the image."""
"""So, I switch on the alpha channel."""
"""So, let's select the Eraser."""
"""Here, my foreground and background colour are the same; so I pick the orange colour by pressing Ctrl+click as the background colour."""
"""So, basically we are painting with the background colour and now I On the alpha channel by right clicking on the layer and Add Alpha Channel and you can see the name is not bold anymore and now I select the"
You can see that foreground and background colour is erased.
Now I will tell you more about Paintbrush and the brushes you can select for painting.
"""So, let's talk about the brushes in this tutorial of Meet The GIMP."""
Brushes are used by a lot of tools starting with the Pencil and I think ending with Dodge and Burn tool.
"""All these tools in between, use a brush except for the Ink."""
"""So, now I select the Paintbrush as an example."""
"""You can select brushes either by clicking on the Brushes dialog or in the tool box, select the Paintbrush and click on the Brush option and you will get the set of brushes."""
"""There are small signs around here, the plus shows that the brush is not as small as shown here and when I click on that I see a big brush."""
"""This, the red triangle, is the animated brush."""
Let’s try this here.
It looks a bit like a pencil drawing and this is called pencil sketch.
The blue ones are parametric brushes.
They are basically mathematical mode which I will show you a bit later.
Here are some standard brushes.
"""In this brush, the black part is filled with the foreground colour. In this case, it’s black and the white part in these standard brushes is not changed. So, I can paint here."""
"""And, if I change my foreground colour to red then the small image will be red in my painting and this white will stay as background."""
"""There are some others brushes here, like this one, the pepper color brush."""
I can just put a pepper in here and even draw a line of these peppers.
This brush is not very useful but you can make your own brushes and there it can be very useful.
Here is a brush which is a very nice thing.
This is the vine and you can draw a line of vine which looks quite nice.
You can use it for little decoration.
"""Let's look at the strange brush here, in the front Clipboard."""
"""So, now I draw something but before that I should use black and white as my colours."""
"""So, now I select a square area around this painting and copy it with Ctrl+C into the Clipboard."""
"""For copying, I could have gone to Edit >> Copy or I could have right clicked and Copy."""
Now I select my Paintbrush here and I select the Clipboard dialog.
"""You see, here it isn’t working."""
I could only paint in this selection because this area is selected and this area isn’t selected.
"""So, I have selected this by Shift+Ctrl+A and now I can paint."""
"""You see here, my little flower pops up."""
You can even draw a line of the little flowers which is not very good because the background is also copied and each flower was overlaid by the other.
This will look nice if you just copy a little bit of an image and then drawing into the image where you want to have it.
You can use it for stamping your logos or  stamp a face of a person in a crude way in an image.
When I open the Brushes page here I can modify a bit about the brushes.
"""First thing here is Spacing and still I have my clipboard brush selected and when I go to 100% with the spacing, I can draw a line of lovely flowers."""
"""In this dialog, you can also make a new brush by just clicking on the first option here but this is editing option."""
"""So, click on the second option and here I can make a new brush."""
"""I can select a Shape either circle, square or diamond."""
Let's take the diamond. I can change this Radius and I can add some Spikes to the brush as well.
You can see that I can change the Hardness of my brush and make it softer or harder.
I can change the Aspect ratio also.
"""By changing the Angle of the brush, I can tilt it a bit and I can change the Spacing."""
"""Let's do that here. With this little star, enhance the Spacing to 200 or so."""
And now I am finished making a new brush and I call it star.
Now you can see in the Brushes dialog your new star brush.
And when you use it you get this kind of star.
"""Now, I only have to fill this up with black."""
Select Gold as your foreground colour.
Apply high amount of jitter to the star brush and stamp the star here.
I think the jitter is quite a lot and it doesn't look nice.
This was a very quick way of making a new brush.
I can edit this brush by selecting the first option and I can change the Angle a bit and turning it and now I can use it here.
I have changed the angle a bit so this works quite well.
You can do your own mathematically defined brushes by making a new brush.
The first option is just to copy something into the clipboard.
The last thing I want to show you in this tutorial is to get brushes from the net and that can be done simply by searching for GIMP brushes and I have here one example for you on deviantART by Iceytina.
Here are the available brushes that Iceytina has made and I can download them by selecting here Download.
And I save them to the disk.
I have downloaded it to my disk and I will install them in a moment.
"""So, let's look at this page and you can see that these brushes are licensed in the Creative Commons License and I am not allowed to  do derivative works with this. So, I am not allowed to take these brushes"
"""But, I may use them and work with them and even publish them on my website with attribution to Iceytina and the original link."""
You can see here that there is a link to GIMP Brushes and there are a lot more brushes on deviantART and on other web sites.
This is one of the newest and popular brush from last 24 hours.
I select 1 month and you can see now there are lots of different brushes.
And well! Let's take this Stardust and Twinkles.
But this is quite shocking.
KNUX’S Spike Brush Pack by Knux57.
"""Well, there is no license information here, so I can download it and I can work on it."""
I just click on Download.
Here you can see the folder opened of GIMP 2.4 brushes and here you can see 'star.vbr'.
I don't know about 'vbr' but 'gbr' are the standard brushes from the GIMP.
Here are the brushes made by Iceytina from that website.
I open this folder with my archive tool and you can see there are 'water colours' in 'jpg' and a lot of other files like 'README'.
"""So, let me just select them all and pull them over into the brushes directory."""
Here they are.
And I do the same with Knux Spike Brush Pack.
I open the folder with Archive manager and you see here GIMP brush files.
So I select them all and pull them over to my brushes directory.
"""Now I have all the brushes in my brush directory, so I close my Archive Manager and I close the folder here and get back to the GIMP."""
"""You can see that nothing has changed here but I can select this Reload Brushes. And now you see, I have lot more brushes and these brushes are from Iceytina, and now I can try them here."""
These brushes are like water colour.
"""So, I select a colour from the water colour box here and draw."""
These brushes can be used only for stamping and not for drawing.
These brushes have lots of jitter in it.
Let me first clear the background.
"""So, these brushes here are well for something like faking a water colour or you can use them to build a frame around the image."""
"""So, now let's look at the Knux brushes."""
I haven’t seen  them before and let's try that.
These brushes are big. It's again a thing for stamping
"""and quite different. When I paint with them, it's not that nice but when I increase the spacing and decrease the opacity it can be nice."""
"""If you need a border around something, it can be quite nice."""
But I think these brushes are made for graphical artists and not that useful for photographers.
But perhaps you will find a way to use them.
"""I think, I have covered a lot of things about the brushes and I will cover making an animated brush, image hose and making these colour brushes in another small edition."""

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on feedback diagram creation using Xfig.
"""In the spoken tutorial on block diagram creation, we created the diagram shown here."""
We will refer to it as the blocks tutorial.
Please master the blocks tutorial before starting the current one.
"""In this tutorial, we will explain how to create block diagrams of the type shown on this page."""
"""I shall use Xfig version 3.2, patch level 5."""
"""We will begin with """"block.fig"""" created in the blocks tutorial."""
"""Let us choose the File, then Open."""
"""In the entry box, we can enter """"block"""" and press Open. Or double-click on “block.fig”."""
"""Using the Save as option on File, we will save this figure as """"feedback""""."""
"""We now have the file """"feedback.fig""""."""
Let us put the grids on by clicking on the Grids.
The scroll bar on the right can be used to move the canvas up or down.
The role of each mouse button is shown on the top right hand side.
This role depends on the activity.
"""To illustrate this, let me take the mouse to the vertical scroll bar."""
Observe the comment next to the left button.
"""I cannot move the mouse to show this. It is because, the role of the buttons will change if I move the cursor away from the scroll bar."""
The left-button moves the canvas up and the right-button moves it down.
"""Instead of clicking the left or right button, we can also click the centre button, hold and drag the canvas up or down."""
"""In a similar way, you can move the canvas to the right or left, using the scroll bar on the top. Left, right.."""
"""I will now move the box to the centre by clicking the middle button, holding and dragging the canvas to the centre."""
"""As I release the mouse, the box gets moved to the centre."""
Let us now create the feedback diagram starting from this block.
Let us copy this box.
Click on the box and select it.
Move the mouse to the new location and click.
Let us now put some text.
"""Let us click the text-box, indicated by T, from the left hand side panel."""
Let us choose the size of the text.
Move the mouse to the value-box and enter 16.
Click Set.
Let us click the Text Just button in the attributes panel.
Let us choose the centre alignment.
Let us click at the centre of the first box.
"""Sorry, I did not choose the correct position."""
I will click at a different location to move the cursor away.
I will then click at the correct position.
Let us now type the text “Control” and click the mouse.
We would now want to enter some more lines with arrows.
Let us choose the POLYLINE button.
Let us select the Arrow Mode button from the attributes panel and select the second option.
Let us click the Arrow Type button and an arrow head.
Let us click at the point where we want the line to start.
Let us move the mouse to the end point of the desired line.
Let us now click there with middle mouse button.
The line is created with an arrow.
I want to place a circle.
Let us choose the circle on the left from the left hand side panel.
We will place it to the left of the first box.
"""Click the mouse. As I move the mouse, the circle becomes bigger."""
"""When we get the right size, let us release the mouse button."""
"""Oops, the circle is larger than what I wanted."""
"""I can undo this operation, using the Edit button at the top."""
"""We can also delete this object, using the Delete button on the left hand panel."""
Let us do that now.
A skeleton with cross hairs appears.
All key points of all objects also appear.
Move the cross hairs to a key point that indicates the circle and click.
"""In case a wrong object is deleted, no need to panic."""
"""You can undo it: Click the Edit button, hold, go to Undo and release the mouse."""
"""If some objects are closely placed, you may have difficulty in choosing them."""
You can solve this through the zoom feature.
"""Click the View button on the top left hand side, hold and choose one of the zoom options."""
Let me release the mouse at Zoom to fit the canvas.
Now it is easy to discriminate between the objects.
Let me delete the circle now.
Let me unzoom.
I will move the diagram to the centre with the use of scroll buttons.
I do not like to leave the delete symbol on because I can accidentally delete something else.
I can change this by choosing any other button.
Let me choose the left circle.
Let me redraw the circle.
I want to put another line from this line.
"""For this, we will first put a dot on the line."""
"""Let us click the Library, on the left hand side panel."""
The Library is indicated by a stack of books.
A dialog window opens.
"""Next to the Library, it says """"None Loaded""""."""
Let us click and hold.
A list of available libraries appears.
Move the mouse to the 'Logic' library and release the mouse.
Let us choose the small dot by double clicking on it.
The dialog window gets closed.
We see a cross hair along with the chosen small dot.
Let us place the dot on the line by clicking.
"""The cursor and the small dot show up once again, suggesting that we can place it at some other location also."""
We do not want to place the dot at any other place.
Let us close it by clicking the right button of the mouse.
The right button does an undo operation.
"""In this case, dot selection has been removed."""
Let us draw a line from this dot to the circle.
Let us select the Polyline.
Notice that the previous selections of Arrow Mode and Arrow Type have been remembered.
"""Within a session, Xfig remembers the parameter values."""
Click at the dot.
Move the mouse to the bottom and click.
"""Now turn the mouse to the left, until at the bottom of the circle. Click."""
Move the mouse to the circle and now click the middle mouse button.
"""Let us draw another line, to the left of the circle, by copying."""
Let us now save this figure using the File button at the top left hand corner of Xfig and choosing Save.
Let us now Export the file.
Let us click the File button once again and choose Export.
Let us choose Language and then PDF.
"""We get the file """"feedback.pdf""""."""
Let us open this file through the command open feedback.pdf.
We now have the block diagram that we wanted.
We have completed our objective.
We have an assignment for you.
Substitute the blocks with different objects.
Try out operations such as rotate and flip.
"""View the file """"feedback.fig"""" in an editor and identify different components."""
"""Using the Library, create entirely different block diagrams."""

We welcome your participation and also your feedback.
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Create and format text using Inkscape.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about: Inserting text Formatting and aligning text Spacing and bullet."""
We will also learn how to create a simple flyer at the end.
"""To record this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS Inkscape version 0.48.4"""
I will be recording this tutorial in maximum resolution mode. This is to accommodate all the tools that will be demonstrated.
Let us open Inkscape.
Text can be inserted using the Text tool from the Tool box.
We can add text in two ways- Regular Text and Flowed Text.
First we will learn about Regular Text. Click on the Text tool and then click on the canvas.
Type the word Spoken. Observe the text box grows to accommodate the text.
"""Line breaks have to be added manually. So, press Enter to go to the next line and type “Tutorial”."""
"""To move the word to the previous line, keep the cursor before the alphabet 'T'. Now press backspace and add a space between the 2 words."""
"""In a similar way, type: http://spoken-tutorial.org/ on a new line, below """"Spoken Tutorial""""."""
"""Next, we will learn to insert text through Flowed text."""
"""This time, I will copy text from a LibreOffice Writer file that I had saved earlier."""
Press Ctrl + A to select the entire text and press Ctrl + C to copy that.
"""Now, come back to Inkscape. Make sure the Text tool is selected."""
Click on the canvas and drag to form a rectangular or square text area.
"""Notice, a blue rectangle box is formed on the canvas on releasing the mouse button."""
"""Now, inside the text box, notice the text prompt which is blinking on the extreme top left corner."""
Press Ctrl + V to paste the copied text.
"""Observe, the color of the text box changed to red."""
This is because the inserted text exceeds the boundaries of the text box.
We can correct this using the small diamond handle at the right corner of the text box.
Click and drag it till the text box color changes to blue.
The last sentence of the text is clubbed with the previous sentence.
Press Enter twice at the beginning of the last sentence to separate it.
"""Next, let us learn the various formatting options available for texts. Click on the word “Spoken Tutorial”"""
Go to Main menu. Click on Text and then on Text and Font option.
A dialog box appears with two options – Font and Text. Under the Font tab there are several options.
Font family lists all the available fonts. You can select any of the available fonts of your choice.
We can preview the selected font in the preview box here. My choice is Bitstream Charter font.
"""There are four Style options- Normal, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic. Choose the style as per your requirement. I will choose Bold."""
"""To change the Font size, simply click on the drop-down arrow and select the size. Since this is the title, I will select a bigger font, say 64."""
Next is the Layout.
We will learn about this in a while as the preview is not visible for this option.
"""Now, click on the Text tab next to the Font tab. Here, a preview window is seen with the text inside it."""
Any modifications to the text can be done here.
Click on Apply and close the dialog box. Observe the text is now formatted.
We can change the text color using the color palette at the bottom. Let me click on maroon color.
"""Next, select the text for the URL i.e. http://spoken-tutorial.org"""
Text formatting options are available in the Tool controls bar too.
"""I will change the font to Bitstream charter, Font size to 28 and color to Blue."""
"""Now, let us choose the paragraph text."""
"""If the Text tool is already selected, you can simply click on the text to go inside the text box."""
I will change the Font size of the text to 25.
Click and drag the diamond handle to move the text inside the canvas.
"""Next, let us align the texts."""
The four icons next to the Italic icon on the Tool controls bar help to align the text to the Left Center OR Right of the text box.
The fourth option will justify the text within the boundaries of the text box. I will click on left align before proceeding further.
We can align the text using the Align and distribute option too.
Go to the Main menu and then click on Object menu. Then click on Align and Distribute option.
"""Now, we will move the word Spoken Tutorial to the centre. So click on it."""
First check if the Relative to parameter is set to Page.
"""So, click on Centre on vertical axis. Observe the text is now aligned to the centre."""
Let us add some more text in the empty space at the bottom.
"""Type FOSS Categories. Now, align it to the centre of the page by clicking on Centre on vertical axis."""
"""Type some FOSS names such as Linux, LaTeX, Scilab, Python separately and randomly on the canvas."""
"""Now, let us align all these texts in a single row with equal space."""
Select the 4 texts using the Shift key. Click on Align baseline of text and Distribute baseline of text horizontally.
Notice the gaps between the words are not equal.
The first letter of the first word and the first letter of the second word are equally spaced. But the words themselves are not equally spaced.
This works in a similar way for vertical texts too.
These options may be useful in certain situations.
We will make the spaces between the words equal.
"""To do so, click on the fourth icon in the first row under Distribute. Now the spacing is equal between the words."""
"""Next, we will learn to adjust the space between the lines of the paragraph text."""
Double-click on the paragraph text to go inside the text box.
The Spacing between lines icon on the Tool controls bar helps reduce or increase space between lines.
Observe what happens when I increase the spacing.
Let me keep the line spacing as 1.50.
"""The next icon helps to adjust space between letters. Again, click on the up and down arrows and observe the changes."""
Let me keep the space parameter as 0.
Observe there is an empty space in both the vertical corners of the canvas. We can fill them with some text.
"""Type a sentence: """"Learn Open Source Software for free"""". somewhere outside the canvas."""
Change the Font to Ubuntu. Font size to 22 and make it Bold.
Now click on the last icon i.e. Vertical text on the Tool controls bar.
Notice that the text is now aligned in vertical direction.
Click on the text using the Selector tool and move it to the left corner of the canvas.
Press Ctrl + D to duplicate it and move the copy to the other corner of the page using the Ctrl key.
"""Now, we will add bullet points to the text within the paragraph."""
Inkscape does not provide bullet or number lists for text. So one has to create bullet points manually.
Click on the ellipse tool. Draw a small circle of red color.
Now move this bullet to the first line of the paragraph. Duplicate it and move its copy to the next sentence.
Repeat this for all sentences.
"""Now, we have all our text as per our requirement."""
"""Lastly, let us do some beautification to make it look like a flyer."""
Here is the completed flyer.
I have added borders to the top and bottom. And covered the texts with a rounded rectangle and ellipse shapes.
You can use your creativity to create different layouts and designs for your flyer.
Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we learnt to: Insert text Format and align text Spacing and bullet lists."""
We also learned to create a simple flyer.
Here is an assignment for you-
Create a flyer like this. Use the text tool to type texts. Create bullets and boxes using the rectangle tool.
Create star using star tool with 10 corners. Use color palette and Fill and stroke to change colors. Align the text using Align and distribute.

Hello and welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Basics of System Administration in Linux.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn the following-"""
"adduser,su,usermod,userdel,id,du,df"
I am using Linux for this tutorial.
"""As a prerequisite, please go through the spoken tutorial on General Purpose Utilities in Linux   which is available on this website."""
One must have admin access in order to execute the commands shown.
Let us first learn how to create a new user.
The adduser command will create a new user login for us along with authentication.
We can add any user account with the help of  sudo command.
Let me give you a brief explanation about the sudo command.
Sudo command allows the administrative user to execute a command as a super user.
The sudo command has many options. We will learn about the options as we go further in this tutorial.
Let's now learn how to create a New User.
I have already invoked the Terminal here.
"""Here, type the command: sudo space adduser and press Enter."""
You will be prompted for a password.
I will give the Admin password here and Enter.
The typed password on the terminal is not visible.
"""So, we have to type the password carefully."""
"""Once done, a message  """"adduser : Only one or two names allowed"""" is displayed."""
"""So, let us create a new user account named duck."""
Type the command :
sudo space adduser space duck and press Enter.
"""We have created a new user called """"duck""""."""
"""In the process of creating a new user, a separate home directory for that user has also been created."""
Please note that we will be prompted for a new password for the user duck.
"""Type the password of your choice, in my case I am going to type """"duck"""" as the password and press Enter."""
Please type the new password again.
The password is asked twice for security reasons and for confirmation.
Now our password for the new user is updated.
We will be asked for other details too.
"""But for the time being, I will enter only the Full Name as """"Duck"""" and leave the rest of the details blank by pressing the Enter key."""
Enter.I will confirm this by entering “y”.
This is to confirm that all the information is correct.
"""Let us now check, if the user account has been created."""
"""To do this, please type at the command prompt:"""
ls  /(slash) home
and press Enter.
To show the list of users in the home folder this command is used.
"""And, here is our newly created user named """"duck""""."""
Let me switch back to the slides.
Now the next command is the su command.
su stands for Switch User.
This command is useful for switching from the current user to another user.
Let us go to the Terminal now.
Enter the command: su space hyphen space duck on the terminal and press Enter.
You will be prompted for a password.
"""I shall type the user duck password here, please recall that it was """"duck"""" itself."""
"""Please notice that, the Terminal switches from the previous user to the new user which is “duck” in our case."""
"""To logout from this user, type logout and hit Enter."""
Now the terminal logs out from the current user duck and comes back to the previous user account which is vinhai in our case.
Let us learn about the usermod command.
The usermod command enables a super user or root user to modify the settings of other user accounts such as:
Change the password to no password or empty password.
Show the date on which the user account will be disabled.
Let us try this command and see.
Let me switch to the terminal now.
Let me show you how to set a date of expiry for the user account duck.
"""Here, at the command prompt, type:"""
sudo space usermod space -(hyphen)e space 2012-(hyphen)12-(hyphen)27 space duck
and press Enter.
The user account expiry date is set as mentioned in the command here with the help of the option “-e”.
Now you have set an expiry date for the user account duck.
Let us now talk about the uid and gid commands.
id – command is used to check the identities of all the users and groups.
"""To know about the identity of the user, we use id space -(hyphen)u."""
"""To know about the identity of the group users, it is id space -(hyphen)g."""
Now let's work on this.
"""At the terminal, let us type id and press Enter."""
"""Now, we can see the User IDs and Group IDs on the system that we are using."""
"""To get only the user-id, we use “-u"""" (hyphen u) option."""
Let us type the command: id space -(hyphen) u
and press enter.
"""Now, we can see only the 'id's of the users."""
But what if we need to know the names of the users?
"""To find that out, we will type:"""
id space -(hyphen) n space -(hyphen) u on the terminal here and press Enter.
"""Now, we can see the names of the users instead of their 'id's."""
Let us now learn the commands for Group IDs.
Let's type:  id space -(hyphen)g.
Here we can see the group ids.
"""If we want to view all the current user's group IDs, type:"""
id space -(hyphen) (capital)G and press Enter.
Please notice that I have typed 'G' in capital letter.
See the result for yourself.
"""Now, let us learn how to delete a user account."""
"""For this, we use userdel command."""
We can delete an user account permanently with the help of the userdel command.
Let's try this on the terminal.
"""Here, type: sudo space userdel space -(hyphen)r space duck."""
I have used the '-(hyphen)r' option.
This is to remove the user along with his home directory.
Let us press Enter and see what happens.
Now the user duck has been deleted.
Check this by typing:
ls space /(slash) home and press  Enter.
We will find that the user account duck has been deleted.
Let me go back to the slides now.
Some of the useful commands in Linux System Administration are “df” and “du”.
The df command gives a report on the free space available on the disk.
And the du command gives a report on how much space a file has occupied.
Please try these two commands and find the output for yourself as an assignment.
Let us shift to the terminal. I shall show you a few useful options used with the “df” command.
Please type: df space -(hyphen)h and press Enter.
"""Here, it shows the size of the File system and the space used."""
"""It also shows the space mounted on, in a human readable format."""
Let us now try some options with the “du” command.
"""At this point, I assume that you have created some text files in your home folder."""
"""If not, please refer to the tutorial on General Purpose Utilities in Linux."""
I have already created some text files in my home directory to execute the commands.
Go to home folder on the terminal by typing:
cd space /(slash) home and press Enter.
"""Then, type: du space -(hyphen)s space *. (asterisk dot) txt and press Enter."""
This command will give you a report on the txt files available in the directory along with its file sizes.
"""As an assignment, at the command prompt, please type:"""
du space -(hyphen)ch space *.(asterisk dot) txt and see what happens.
Let me go back to the slides.
"""To summarize, we have learnt:"""
"""""""adduser"""" command to create a new user."""
“su” command to switch from one user to another user.
“usermod” command to change the user account settings.
“userdel” command to delete the user account.
"""""""id"""" command to know the information about user ids and group ids."""
“df” command to check the file system size and its availability.
“du” command to check the space occupied by a file.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on “Basics of system administration”.

Welcome to the spoken tutorial on block diagram creation using Xfig.
"""In this tutorial, we will explain how to create block diagrams of the type given below."""
We will see the tools required for this purpose:
"""I shall use Xfig, a block diagram manipulation tool."""
"""I am using version 3.2, patch level 5."""
I will also use the terminal and a 'pdf' browser.
I am creating this tutorial on Mac OS X.
Xfig works on Linux and Windows also.
Installation on Linux is the easiest of all.
The procedure to use Xfig is the same in all three.
It is recommended to use a three button mouse for Xfig.
But one or two button mouse can also be configured to work.
The user manual for Xfig is available on the web.
Let us see it. We can see the introduction to Xfig in this page.
"""We can see the Table of Contents of this manual, here."""
Let us click on it.
"""We can see the details of the people who created Xfig, here."""
Let us see this page.
I will now explain the screen configuration for this tutorial.
"""It has the slides, Xfig, internet browser – Firefox and the terminal."""
This is the command I used to invoke Xfig on Mac.
"""These are arranged in an overlapping fashion, for easy switch from one to the other."""
The listener can easily see the switch happening – no need for guess work.
Let us start with Xfig.
The left hand side of Xfig worksheet has the drawing mode panel.
The buttons on top half of this panel can be used to create different objects.
The ones in the bottom are used to work with them.
"""Using the buttons at the top, one can carry out File and Edit operations."""
The space in the centre is known as the canvas.
This is where the figure will be created.
Let us now get started with drawing.
The first thing I will do is to put the grids on the canvas.
"""I do this by clicking on the Grid Mode button, at the bottom."""
We can choose different grid sizes. I will choose the middle one.
Grids help align the different objects that we would place.
"""In this tutorial, by clicking I mean clicking the left mouse button and releasing it."""
"""Similarly, selecting or choosing a button would mean that you have to click it with the left mouse."""
"""If a different action is required, I will state it explicitly."""
"""As our diagram should have a box, let us choose the Box symbol with sharp corners, from the left hand side panel."""
We will go to the place where we want to place the box.
We will click the mouse at this point.
This selects the north west corner of the box.
Move the mouse to the opposite end until the box is of the size we want.
"""Once the box is of right size, we can click the mouse once again."""
The box is now created.
"""We will now explain how to use the Edit feature of Xfig.  Using this, we will increase the thickness of the box."""
Let us press the Edit button in the left hand panel.
We see that all the key points of the box are displayed.
Let us click on any one of these points and thus select the box.
A dialog-box opens.
We will take the mouse to the Width box.
Make sure that the mouse pointer stays within the box.
Let us delete the default value of 1.
The contents of this box cannot be changed if the mouse is not inside the box.
"""If the mouse moves away at any time of entry in the box, please bring it inside and continue typing."""
Let us now enter 2.
We click the Done. Let me show you this.
Click the Done and leave the dialog-box.
We see that the thickness of the box has increased.
We would now want to enter lines with arrows.
Let us choose the POLYLINE button from the left hand side panel.
The panel at the bottom is known as the Attributes panel.
"""Using the buttons present in this panel, the parameters of each object may be changed."""
The number of buttons change depending on the chosen object.
Let us select the Arrow Mode button from the attributes panel.
Let us choose the second option in the dialog-box as this would give an arrow at the end point.
Let us click the Arrow Type button.
"""In the window that appears, we select the arrow head of our choice."""
Let us click at the point where we want the line to start.
Let us now click there with middle mouse button
The line is created with an arrow.
"""Remember, you have to press the middle button to complete the arrow."""
Not the left or right button.
"""If you make a mistake, please click the Edit and press Undo."""
"""Let us draw another line, at the output of the box, by copying."""
Choose the COPY button from the left hand side panel.
Choose the line.
Move the mouse to the destination and click.
The line is copied.
Let us put some text now.
"""Let us click the Text box, indicated by T, from the left hand side panel."""
Let us choose the font-size of the text.
Let us click the Text Size button from the attributes panel and obtain a dialog window.
Let us move the mouse to the value-box and keep the mouse there.
Let us delete the default value of 12 and enter 16.
Let us choose the button Set.
The dialog-box gets closed and the Text Size is now shown as 16 in the attributes panel.
We will centre align the text.
Let us click the Text Just button in the attributes panel.
Let us choose the middle one for centre alignment.
Let us click at the centre of the box.
I will type Plant and click the mouse.
The text is created.
"""I can move the text with the Move key on the left hand side panel, if required."""
Let us now save this figure.
"""Let us click the File button at the top left hand corner of Xfig, hold and drag the mouse to Save and release."""
"""As this is the first time, Xfig asks for the file name."""
We can choose the directory and then the file name.
"""Let us type the name as """"block"""" and choose Save."""
"""The file gets saved as """"block.fig""""."""
You can see that name at the top.
Let us now export the file.
"""Let us click the File button once again, hold and drag the mouse to Export."""
"""Click the box next to Language, hold and drag the mouse to PDF and release the key to select the PDF Format."""
"""Now click the Export button. We get the file """"block.pdf""""."""
Let us open this file through the command open block.pdf from the terminal.
We now have the block diagram that we wanted.
We have completed our objective. We have the figure we want.
We have an assignment for you.
Substitute the box with different objects.
Create a rectangle using Polyline. Change the size and the direction of the arrows in the figure.
"""Move the text, line and box to different locations."""
Export the file in 'eps' format and view it.
"""View the file """"block.fig"""" in an editor and identify different components."""
Create entirely different block diagrams.
We have now come to the end of this tutorial.

“ Recording File”
We now explain  the process involved in creating spoken tutorials.
We start an outline as shown here.
We  write the script for each tutorial as shown here.
Then we record the script.
We have already seen the recording. Then we translate the script as shown here.
Then we dub it as shown here.
Recording files
This was a tutorial in Hindi.
We will come back to this.
Here is the  architecture of a spoken tutorial.
"""We conduct workshops using spoken tutorials, Domain experts are not required."""
Workshops are of 2 hour duration.
The students learn at their own speed.
They can use a  language of their  choice.
All of them can reach the same level.
We have found the workshops to be very effective.
These workshops are becoming very popular.
We currently conduct 200 workshops a month.

Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Introduction to Gmail.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to create a new google account, login to gmail using the google account, write an email, send an email, view an email and logout of gmail."
We will also learn about some of the important mailboxes like Inbox.
"""For this tutorial, you will need -  a working Internet connection"" and a web browser."
"""For demonstration, I will be using Firefox web browser."""
"""Lately, Google has provided a single account for all Google products like:"""
Gmail YouTube
Google Play Google Docs/Drive
Google Calendar....  and more.
"""So, with the same login, you can operate any of these."""
Let's begin by creating a new google account.
Open your web browser and type: http colon slash slash gmail dot com (http://gmail.com).
It will take us to the page where we can see 2 options at the top right-
Create an account   and Sign in.
"""If this is the first time this page is accessed from your machine, it will look like this."""
"""If this page has already been accessed from your machine, then the page will look like this."""
"""So, you will see text-boxes to enter your email username and password."""
And a big button that says Sign In.
"""Below this, you will see a link that says Create an account."""
Let's click on the Create an account link.
We are now in the Google Account creation page.
"""We can see a form on the right, wherein we have to fill our account and personal details."""
Let's enter our first and last names in the respective text-boxes.
I will give my name as Rebecca Raymond.
"""Next, we have to choose our username."""
Username  has to be unique and can be made up of alphabets or alpha-numeric combinations.
"""Let's give the username as """"becky0808""""."""
"""If the username is already taken, we will see the following message:"""
"""“Someone already has that user name, Try another”."""
Google will also suggest some usernames based on the first and last names we have given.
We can give any username of our choice and check for availability.
"""Now, I will give the username  as ray.becky.0808."""
This goes through which indicates this username is available.
"""Now, we have to create a password for this account."""
The information box on the left tells us how long the password should be.
Type a suitable password of your choice.
Then re-type the password to confirm it.
After this comes Birthday.
Select the month from the drop-down.
Then type the day and year in the respective text boxes.
Now select your gender. I am selecting Female.
The next field is Mobile phone.
I will skip this for now.
"""After this, is a text box that asks for our current email address."""
"""If you have an alternate email address, apart from the one you are creating now, type it here."""
"""If you don't, leave it as blank."""
Let's fill the remaining details now.
The next segment “Prove you're not a robot” has 2 verification steps.
Phone verification
Puzzle verification.
We can proceed with any one of these 2 options.
I will go with the puzzle verification.
"""Type the text/number shown in the image, in the Type the text text-box."""
"""The country where you are located is displayed, by default, in the Location drop-down."""
"""I am located in India. So, India is shown in my Location drop-down."""
"""Lastly, click on I agree to the Google Terms of service and Privacy Policy check-box, to check it."""
"""Once all the details are filled in the form, we have to click on Next Step button."""
"""Right now, we will not do so."""
"""Let us see what to do, if we select “Phone Verification”."""
Click on the “Skip this verification (Phone Verification may be required)” check-box.
Choose the location as India (भारत)
Then click on I agree to the Google Terms and Privacy Policy check-box.
"""And lastly, click on Next Step."""
It will divert to the Phone verification page.
"""Select a country flag from the dropdown, I am selecting  India."""
Enter your mobile number in the text box provided.
"""Select Text message (SMS)  option. Usually, it will be selected by default."""
Then click on Continue button.
You will receive an SMS on your phone.
It will now take you to the next part of the verification.
"""Type the verification code you received from Google via SMS, in the text box provided."""
Click on Continue.
We are now in the 'Create your public Google+ profile' page.
"""Here, you can see your name."""
"""Below this, there is an option to “Add a photo”."""
You can click on this to add a photo for your Google profile.
There is also a button named “Create your profile”.
"""For the time being, I'm skipping these steps."""
"""Instead, I will click on No Thanks  button to proceed to my email account."""
"""Now, we are in the welcome page."""
"""And in my case, it says “ Welcome, Rebecca”."""
My new email address ray.becky.0808@gmail.com is also displayed.
"""Now, click on Continue to Gmail button."""
It will start loading your mail account.
Based on your internet speed this may take some time.
"""If our internet is slow, we can click on Load basic HTML."""
It is available at the right side bottom.
It will load gmail without any graphical look.
Some information boxes will  pop-up on the screen.
Read them or explore further by clicking on the Next button and then close them.
This is the default or Standard view of your gmail account.
The center display area is where we can see all our mails.
"""Notice that there are three tabs here. We will learn about them in detail, in future tutorials."""
"""On the left side, we can see some labeled menu items."""
"""Inbox, Starred, Sent Mail, Drafts, and More are some of the prominent mailboxes of Gmail."""
"""By default, Inbox is selected and its contents are shown in the display area."""
Notice that Inbox has no. 3 in brackets.
This indicates the number of new mails that you have received.
"""When we create a new google account, we get some mails from the Gmail Team."""
You can read them for more information on how to use Gmail features.
"""Now, let's learn how to write an email."""
Click on the COMPOSE button on the left-hand side.
A window with the name New Message opens up.
It has four segments.
To – is the place where we type the email address of the person to whom we want to send the email.
"""Here, I'll type the same email-id that we created just now, i.e. ray.becky.0808@gmail.com"""
It means that I'm sending a mail to myself.
Next segment is Subject.
"""Here, we can type the brief subject line about the mail."""
Let's say “Welcome mail”.
Next is the content area.
Here we have to write our message that we want to send.
"""Let's type, “Greetings to all from the Spoken Tutorial Project”."""
"""In the last segment, there is a blue button that says Send."""
Click on it to send the email.
Notice the number of mails in the Inbox is now 4.
"""To read a particular mail, simply click on it."""
Here is the mail I sent to myself.
Let's have a look at it.
Click on the Show details arrow.
Here are the email addresses of the sender and receiver.
Here is the date and time when the email was sent.
Here is the subject line of the email.
And the content is here.
"""Now, notice that the number of unread emails in the Inbox is 3."""
"""Now, let us learn how to sign out from Gmail."""
"""At the top right, you will see your email-id."""
"""If you had uploaded a photo during account creation then you will see that, here, instead."""

Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Creating and viewing inventories.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn:"""
To modify the login page to redirect to admin page
To fetch all the book details
To fetch borrowed book details
To display the books borrowed by a logged in user.
Here we are using:
"""To follow this tutorial, you must have  knowledge of:"""
Basics of Java Servlets and JSPs
Database and validation of fields.
"""Now, let us switch to NetBeans IDE ."""
I have created the Books table.
You can see the different fields in the table.
I have inserted 10 books into this table.
I have created Checkout table to store borrowed books.
I have inserted 5 entries into the Checkout table.
I have also created a model for Book and Checkout.
Book.java is a book model.
And Checkout.java is a checkout model.
"""Now, come to the browser."""
Let us login as the admin.
"""So, I will type the username and password as admin. Then click on Sign In."""
We can see that we come to the Admin Section Page.
We will come back to this page. Now let us switch to Netbeans IDE.
"""We will see,  how we modified the GreetingServlet to redirect to Admin Page."""
Let us see the GreetingServlet.java.
Here we check if username and password equal admin.
"""If yes, then we redirect to adminsection.jsp."""
We have already seen how to forward to another page using RequestDispatcher.
"""Now, switch back to the browser."""
We have two options here.
We will click on the radio button for List Books.
Then click on Submit button.
"""Here, we can see that we have the list of all the Books."""
"""It has all the details like- Book Id, Book Name, Author Name, ISBN, Publisher, Total Copies and Available copies."""
"""Now, I will show you how this is done."""
Switch back to the IDE.
"""Now, let us come to  adminsection  dot jsp."""
Here we have two radio buttons.
The first one is to list all the books.
"""We can see that in adminsection  dot jsp, we have form action  equal to AdminSection."""
"""Now, Open AdminSection  dot  java."""
"""Here, this checks the option that we click on."""
We clicked on List Books.
"""So, this part of the query will be  executed."""
We execute the query to fetch books from Books table.
"""Next, we create ArrayList to store the details of the books."""
Then we iterate through the result set.
We create the Book object.
We set BookId into the Book object.
"""Similarly, we set other attributes of the book into the Book object."""
Then we add book object into the books list.
Then we set the ArrayList books into the request.
Then we forward the request to listBooks.jsp using RequestDispatcher.
"""Now, we come to listBooks.jsp."""
"""In this page, admin can view the list of books."""
"""Here, first we obtain the books from the request."""
This HTML table will display the details of the books.
"""So, we will iterate through the book list."""
Here we display the BookId of the book.
"""Similarly, we display other attributes of the book."""
This is how we display the list of books.
"""Now, switch back to the browser."""
Click on List Borrowed Books.
And click on the Submit button.
We see a list of all the Books issued.
"""It has details like Transaction Id, Book Id and Username."""
"""Now, I will switch back to the IDE"""
and show you the code for the same.
Go to AdminSection.java.
We had clicked on List Borrowed Books.
So menuSelection is equal to List Borrowed books.
The steps are similar to what we saw for List Books.
We execute the query to fetch borrowed books details from the Checkout table.
Then we iterate through the borrowed books
and set it into request as checkout attribute.
"""Now, we come to listBorrowedBooks.jsp."""
Here we obtain checkout from the request.
We iterate through the Checkout list
and here we display the attributes of the Checkout.
This is how we display Borrowed Books.
"""Now, switch back to the browser."""
"""In the borrowed books page, we  have one more list."""
The list of books issued when the current date is more than the return date.
Switch back to IDE to see the code.
This is done in the same way as we did for Borrowed Books.
The only difference is in the SQL query.
"""In the query, we give the condition: return_date less than now() order by transaction_Id."""
"""Now, I will show you the interface for a normal user."""
Switch back to the browser.
Come back to the login page.
I will login as mdhusein.
Type the password as welcome
and click on Sign In.
We get a Success Greeting Page.
It has the books currently borrowed by the user.
"""It has details like Transaction Id, User Name, Book Id and Return Date."""
"""Now, let us come back to the IDE."""
Now we go to GreetingServlet.java.
We display the books issued in the same way as we did for the admin.
Here the difference will be that we have to display the books for the logged in user.
"""So, I get the username from this line."""
Then we fetch the details of borrowed books
with the condition username is equal to the logged-in user.
"""So, we get the list of books issued for the corresponding user."""
"""Then, in successGreeting dot jsp we will display the list."""
This is how your successGreeting dot jsp will look.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt to:"""
Modify the login page to redirect to admin page
To fetch the book details
To fetch the borrowed book details and
To display the books borrowed by a logged in user.

Welcome to Meet the GIMP.
Today’s tutorial is not about raw converting but about new coding while doing a real show and to correct some errors from the last tutorial.
I want to tell you something about this image .
I have made some additional changes while recording the show.
"""As you can see the sea is a bit dull and it’s just gray with not much definition in it and when I switch off the Sea layer here and the other layers, you can see there is some definition in the sea."""
"""And when I look at the layer mask, you can see that I used a layer mask which is mostly gray for the area I wanted to show."""
"""So, let’s redo this step again."""
I have deleted the Sea layer and made a copy of the Background layer.
I name the layer as Sea and place that layer below the Sky and above the Land.
I could have worked with the layer I had but I wouldn’t have got a good result because I had used the curves tool to get the sea a bit darker.
"""And with that, I have destroyed a lot of colour information which was present in that layer and I’ll get a better result this way here."""
"""Now, I again add a layer mask to the Sea layer, I use the Gray scale copy of the layer and add it."""
I click on Show layer mask and edit the layer mask.
I will use the Curves tool and I’ll repeat the same procedure by pulling this down but this time I’ll pull this upper curve up.
Now I have a layer mask which is nearly white for the area of the sea and sky and nearly black for the area of land.
"""To correct some missing structure here, I select the Brush tool and choose a bigger Brush here and start painting the land area with black colour."""
"""I don’t want to paint the sea layer with black colour. So, I exchange the foreground and background colour."""
And go to the sea area and start painting with white colour and I think I should do this a bit softer.
"""This area here, I think it was quite well but you can correct that later on."""
"""So, let’s choose a soft brush and see that we get this edge here fine."""
"""When I disable Show Layer Mask, we can see the stretch scene here on the border between land and sea."""
Let’s zoom into the image and you can see there is a halo where the layer mask and the layer don’t work together and I’ll work on it later.
Now I go back to the full image with Shift + Ctrl + E.
I select the Curves tool and check if I have layer mask selected and I include the Sky layer to see the whole image and now I click into the image and play with the curves.
Now you can see the halo between the sea and the land vanishes but the sea is now again bit dull.
But I can pull the curve up here and I get a clear sea here.
And I think I shouldn’t over do it.
"""I can see the sun shine on the sea, the shadow of the clouds, different wave structures and a bit blue colour as it should be on the sea."""
There is a bit problem with the bright stuff at the edge of the sky because sky  is too brightened up and I can solve that problem in later steps.
"""Ok, I can adjust with the Opacity slider the effect of Curves tool and I think I should make it a bit less for a good effect."""
A tip from John Arnold’s broadcast says that we should go to the full possible amount and then go down with the slider because it is much easier to see the effect when you go down
and we can decide the right amount easily.
"""And I think I have done too much with this part. So, I slide the slider down and I think this is ok."""
From where does this bright stuff comes on the horizon?
I deselect the Sky layer and check but it’s not because of it.
"""So, I deselect the Sea layer and its because of Sea layer."""
And I have to darken this part here.
And for doing that I use the Gradient tool.
I select the layer mask and now select the Gradient tool from the tool box and I want to have the land part white and sky part black and I want to have the border here.
The gradient starts with full white and ends with black.
"""So, I zoom into this part. I select the Gradient tool and  start around here."""
"""While making the line, I am pressing Ctrl key and left mouse button and pulling in order to get a straight line and leave the button here."""
"""You see, it worked! The brightness on the horizon is gone and you can see that the layer mask of the land is gone too."""
Let’s have a look at the whole image and you can see all our edits are gone.
"""So, this wasn’t the good way to deal with the horizon so I undo this step here."""
"""Now, first I select the rectangle and check if layer mask is selected and draw the Rectangle in the sky part."""
Now when the rectangle is drawn I can do edit work inside it and rest of the layer mask will not be affected.
Now I again do the same procedure.
Zoom into the bright part here and select the Layer Mask.
"""I want to have black above and white below. So, I start from here, go straight up to the horizon and now you can see  the sea is only white and land and sky are black."""
"""Shift + ctrl + A, disables all selection, shift +ctrl + E goes back to the whole image and  a lot better now."""
I want to edit the Sky layer in the same way like I did for the Land layer.
Just double the Sky layer and switch to Overlay mode.
This is way too much. So I pull down the Opacity slider a bit and we have a bit more contrast in the sky.
And now I think the image is nearly ready except for one thing.
This wall of the house here is way too dark.
This is the case for dodging and burning.
"""Dodging and burning is a term out of the dark room days, where you can  dodge  a picture by keeping your hand or paper or something else in the light beam of the enlarger between the enlarger and photographi"
There you take a paper and cut a hole in a specific form into it and so edit some light to some other parts of the image.
"""It’s quite tedious procedure to figure out which step to be done at what time and you need a lot of sheets of paper for that and when you want to look at such a process, I recommend you to look a film Well P"
"""It’s a film about James and it’s a terrific film even without this, a dark chamber seen."""
I can really recommend you that film.
Now let’s see dodging and burning process.
We have a Dodge and Burn tool in the toolbox here but I would like to work again with layer.
I add one more layer and I want to fill it with white .
I go to colour channel and I keep 50% for gray and 128% in other channel.
This gray colour is 50% gray and I switch the layer mode to Overlay and you can see nothing has happened.
Now I switch the colours to black and white and select a brush.
This brush size is about right. But I decrease the Opacity to let’s say 30% or so.
Now I make sure that I have the new layer  selected and change the foreground colour to white and background colour to black and I start to paint the wall here.
And perhaps you can see it that the compression has done its work and the side of the wall is brightened up.
This process is called dodging because I am keeping the light on the photographic paper and so the wall gets brighter.
When we look at the layer here you can see that I have a whiter area here and there are some other parts of the image which could be a bit lighter.
For example the rocks near the shore.
The best way would be zooming into the image and I can see that now I have made the wall brighter and the structure is nearly gone due to the JPEG compression.
But I can repair that by switching the colour and shortcut key for that is ‘X’ key and make it a bit darker here.
I should pull the Opacity slider a bit down and this is OK.
I think the horizon is very bright. So I adjust the circle size of the brush to paint that part and use black colour to darken that part of the image.
I can work through the image with changing the colour with ‘x’ key and make it a bit darker.
I think that was too much and I am not so sure about what I am doing there.
"""So, undo the step."""
You can see the technique that I made a layer and made it medium gray & 128% for each channel and change the layer mode to Overlay.
Medium gray and Overlay mode do nothing and you can paint into the image with white or black.
"""While painting with white, you make the image a bit brighter; with black you make it darker."""
I think now this image is really finished with editing.
I wouldn’t work again on it except some of you find a mistake in the edits I have made today.
I hope I haven’t done that and name the layer as Dodge and Burn.
That was it for today.

"""This is Hemant Waidande, dubbing for the Spoken Tutorial project."""
"""Welcome to a presentation that introduces the spoken tutorial technology, that has the potential to make India IT literate."""
What is a Spoken Tutorial?
"""It is a recording of a computer session,"""
explaining some software along with a running commentary.
"""The resulting movie is the spoken tutorial,"""
typically of 10 minutes duration.
Steps in creating Spoken Tutorials are:
"""Outline, Script,"""
"""Recording, Translating the script into other languages and"""
Dubbing.  Let me explain each of these steps.
We will show the outline of two software systems:
Xfig and PHP/MySQL.
I have already downloaded all the required links for this tutorial from http://spoken-tutorial.org
Let us see the outline for Xfig.
Let us see the outline for PHP.
Let us go to the next slide.
The 2nd step in creating spoken tutorials is the Script.
"""As a movie needs a good script,"""
a spoken tutorial also needs a good script.
The script of the current tutorial is here.
The guidelines to write a script are here.
A tutorial that explains the guidelines will also be available soon.
I will now create a short 'spoken tutorial' that explains how to send an email from a gmail account.
"""Let me invoke iShowU, a screen recording software."""
Observe a rectangle on the screen.
Whatever comes within this rectangle will get recorded.
I have opened Netscape.
I have placed it exactly within this rectangle.

I just ended the recording.
"""Immediately, the recording software creates a movie."""
Let me first close Netscape and iShowU.
Let me now play the recorded movie.
“Recording plays”
Let us advance it.
Let me close this.
Let us now go to the next slide.
This is what I call as the spoken tutorial.
School going children can also create spoken tutorials – it is very easy.
Let me now explain the Tools we have for recording.
"""On Linux, recordMyDesktop."""
A spoken tutorial explains how to do this.
"""On Windows, we have Camstudio."""
This spoken tutorial explains how to do this.
Both are FOSS.
A tutorial gives guidelines for narration.
Let me play that.
Let me come back to slides.
The 4th Step in creating spoken tutorials is translating the script into local languages
to make it accessible for people weak in English.
I will show translated scripts for getting started on Scilab in
"""Hindi, Marathi and Bengali."""
"""Hindi, Marathi and Bengali."""
Let us go back to the browser.
"""Using the script, we change the spoken part only."""
Video remains the same.
"""On Linux, we can use Audacity and ffmpeg."""
A spoken tutorial explains how to do this.
Let me minimize this browser.
"""Underneath this, I have another browser with several tabs."""
Let me play this: “Recording plays”
"""On Windows, we can use Movie Maker."""
A spoken tutorial explains how to do this.
Let us go to the next slide.
"""We will now see Scilab spoken tutorials in Hindi, Malayalam and Bengali."""
“Recording plays”. Let me play Malayalam..  “Recording plays”. Let me play bengali..  “Recording plays”.
"""Let us go back here, to slides."""
Let us discuss how to present complex topics through spoken tutorials.
"""After all, a spoken tutorial is only ten minutes long."""
"""By combining spoken tutorials, advanced topics can also be taught."""
"""If sufficient small steps are available,"""
Himalayas can also be climbed.
"""Let us now view the study plans for """"LaTeX"""" and """"Scilab""""."""
LaTeX study plans..
Scilab study plans..
Let us go to the next slide.
One can bridge digital divide through spoken tutorials.
"""For example, one can explain: * how to buy train tickets through irctc."""
How to locate low cost agricultural loans.
How to locate information on primary health care.
How to obtain information on first aid.
How to do web search to locate the shop that sells Tvs at the lowest price.
"""Indeed, this list is endless."""
"""As a matter of fact, this approach can be used to bridge digital divide."""
Spoken tutorials are released under creative commons license.
These are available for free download from the spoken tutorial website.
Let us discuss the honorarium available for creating a ten minute spoken tutorial-
"""Rs. 3,500 to create script and slides"""
Rs. 500 for review by novice or beginner
"""Rs. 1,000 for recording the spoken tutorial - this can be done by the beginner as well"""
"""Rs. 1,000 for translation into a local language"""
Rs. 500 for dubbing into a local language
to be paid after review and acceptance.
The above amounts are for a ten minutes spoken tutorial. Actual honorarium will be proportional to the number of minutes.
"""There is a one time bonus of Rs. 5,000 also."""
"""Our target audience is a remote child,"""
"""working alone at midnight, without anyone to help her."""
"""In other words, spoken tutorials need to be created for self learning."""
"""We actively promote Open Source Software,"""
"""conduct workshops through student clubs,  using spoken tutorials and financial support."""
We also look for Campus Ambassadors.
We have a spoken tutorial on Campus Ambassador program.
Let us play it.. “Recording plays”.
Let us show the web site of our project:http://spoken-tutorial.org/

We have come to the end of this tutorial.
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on for loop in java.
"""In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the for loop in Java."""
"""For this tutorial, we are using: Ubuntu 11.10 JDK 1.6 and  Eclipse 3.7.0"""
"""For this tutorial, you should have knowledge of relational operators and if statement in Java."""
"""If not, for relevant tutorials, please  visit  our website which is as shown. [1]"""
Here is the syntax of the for loop.
"""It consists of initialization, loop condition and increment."""
Then it has the for block which keeps on executing till the loop condition is true.
"""Now, let us try out an example in Eclipse."""
"""So, switch to eclipse."""
We already have a class named ForLoopDemo.
Let us add the for loop inside the main method.
"""So, inside the main method , type: int i semicolon."""
"""Then, for within parentheses i  equal to 0 semicolon i  less than  10  semicolon i  equal to  i plus 1."""
This statement decides how the loop is going to progress.
i =0 is the starting condition for the loop.
This condition allows the variable to be initialized.
i<10  is the loop running condition.
If the condition is true then the for block will be executed.
"""Else, it will be ignored."""
"""That means, when 'i' becomes more than or equal to 10, the block is not executed."""
Then i= i+1 states how the loop variable is going to change.
"""Here, the value of 'i' starts with 0."""
"""It keeps increasing by 1, for every iteration of the loop, until it becomes 10."""
"""Now, let us do something with 'i'."""
So open and close curly brackets.
"""Inside the curly brackets, type: System dot out dot  println and print i into i."""
This will print the square of each number from 0 to 9.
Let us see the output.
So save and run the program.
"""As we can see, the loop run over numbers from 0 to 9."""
The square of the number has been printed in each iteration.
"""Now, let us print all the 2 digit numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5."""
"""So, i should have values from 10 to 99."""
"""So, change i equal to 0 to i equal to 10."""
And i less than 10 to i  less than 100.
"""Then, inside the curly brackets, we print the number only if it is a multiple of 3 or 5."""
So type:if within brackets i mod 3 equal equal to 0 OR within brackets i mod 5  equal equal to  0
This statement checks whether 'i' is divisible by '3'or by '5'.
"""Then, in curly  brackets, we will print the value of 'i'."""
"""Now, let us see the output."""
So save and run the program.
We can see that the numbers are either multiples of 3 or 5. In this way we use for loop in Java.
In this tutorial we have learned how to use for loop in java.
"""For assignment, a  three digit number is called Armstrong Number if it is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits."""
"""For example, 153 is equal to '1 cube' plus '5 cube' plus '3 cube'."""
Find all such 3 digit numbers.

Hello.Welcome to the tutorial on Adding a File Chooser to a Java Application.
"""Create an application, Create the application form."""
"""Add the File Chooser,"""
Configure the File Chooser and
run the application.
"""For this demonstration, I am using the Linux Operating System, Ubuntu version 12.04"""
and Netbeans IDE version 7.1.1.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn to add a File chooser to a Java Application using the javax.swing.JFileChooser component."""
"""As a part of this exercise, we will learn to create a small Java application that loads a '.txt' file into a Text Area."""
Let us first create the Java Application:
Launch the IDE.
"""From the main menu, choose File and New Project."""
"""Choose the """"Java"""" Category and the """"Java Application"""" Projects type."""
And click Next.
"""In the Project Name field, let's type: """"JFileChooserDemo""""."""
Clear the Create Main Class check-box.
Make sure that the Set as Main Project check-box is selected.
Click Finish.
"""Here, we will create the JFrame container and add a few components to it."""
Right-click on the Source Packages node.
Choose New > Other.
Choose the Swing GUI Forms categories and the JFrameForm type.
Click Next.
"""For Class Name, type: """"JFileChooserDemo""""."""
"""In the Package field, type: """"jfilechooserdemo.resources""""."""
Click Finish.
"""In the Properties window, select the Title property"""
"""and type: """"Demo Application""""."""
Press Enter to confirm.
"""In the Palette, open the Swing Menus category."""
Select the Menu Bar component and drag it to the top left corner of the Jframe.
Right-click the Edit item of the Menu Bar component.
Select Delete in the context menu.
"""Next, let us add a menu item that allows to open the FileChooser from the running application."""
Make sure that the Menu Bar' is selected before you drag another Menu Item here.
"""In the Swing Menus category in the Palette, select a new Menu Item."""
Drag it to the Menu Bar and drop it onto the File item of the Menu Bar.
Right-click jMenuItem1 in the Design view.
And choose Change Variable Name from the context menu.
Rename the item to Open and click OK.
Make sure that the jMenuItem1 is still selected in the Design view.
Press the Space bar to edit the text of the component.
Change the text to Open and press Enter to confirm.
Specify the action handler for the Open menu item.
"""Right-click the menu item Open and choose Events, Action, Action Performed from the context menu."""
The GUI builder automatically switches to the source view.
A new event handler method  OpenActionPerformed()  is generated.
Let us switch back to the  Design  view.
Let's add a menu item to exit the  File Chooser.
"""In the  Palette , choose the Swing Menus category."""
Select  Menu Item.
Drag it to the  Menu Bar below the Open menu item on the form.
Notice the orange highlighting that indicates where the jmenuItem1  is going to be placed.
Right-click jMenuItem1  in the  Design view.
Choose Change Variable Name from the context menu.
Rename the item to Exit  and click on OK.
Make sure that the jMenuItem1  is still selected in the Design view.
Press the Space bar  to edit the text of the component.
Change the text to  Exit  and press  Enter  to confirm.
Specify the action handler for the  Exit  menu item.
Right-click the menu-item Exit.
"""Choose  Events, Action, Action Performed  from the context menu."""
The GUI Builder automatically switches to the Source view.
A new event handler method named  ExitActionPerformed() is generated.
The  ExitActionPerformed  node appears in the  Navigator  window above the   OpenActionPerformed()  node.
"""If you cannot view your  Navigator,"""
"""go to the  Window  menu in the menu bar,"""
choose  Navigating  and click on  Navigator.
"""Here, you can see the  ExitActionPerformed  node appearing above the  OpenActionPerformed  node."""
"""To make the  Exit  menu-item work,"""
let us include the statement  System.exit(0);  into the  ExitActionPerformed()  method body.
Switch back to the  Design  mode.
"""From the  Swing Controls category of the  Palette, drag a Text Area  onto the form."""
"""Resize the added component to make room for the text, displayed by the  File Chooser  later."""
"""Rename the variable as """"textarea""""."""
Let us next add the actual  File Chooser.
"""If your  Navigator  window is not open, choose  Window, Navigating, a Navigator  to open it."""
"""And in the  Navigator, right-click the Jframe node."""
"""Choose  Add From Palette, Swing Windows and File Chooser  from the context menu."""
You can notice in the  Navigator  that a  JFileChooser  was added to the form.
Right-click the  JFileChooser  node and rename the variable to  fileChooser.
We have now added the  File Chooser.
The next step is to configure the File Chooser  to display the title that you want.
We will also add a custom file filter and integrate the File Chooser into your application.
Click to select the  JfileChooser in the  Navigator window.
"""Now, let's edit its properties in the  Properties  dialog-box."""
"""In the  Properties window, below the Palette,"""
"""change the dialogTitle to """"This is my open dialog""""."""
Press Enter  to confirm.
"""Now, switch to the Source mode."""
"""Now, to integrate the  FileChooser  into your application,"""
I have an existing code snippet which I will copy and paste into the existing OpenActionPerformed() method.
This example reads the file contents and displays them in the Text Area.
We will now call the FileChooser's getSelectedFile()  method to determine which file the user has clicked.
"""I will copy this code onto my clipboard and in the Source view of the IDE, paste it inside the  OpenActionPerformed() method."""
"""If the editor reports errors in your code, right-click anywhere in the code and select Fix Imports."""
"""Now, let us add a custom file filter that makes the File Chooser display only '.txt' files."""
Switch to the Design mode and select the fileChooser in the Navigator window.
"""In the Properties window, click the ellipsis button, next to the fileFilter property."""
"""In the fileFilter dialog-box, select Custom Code from the combo-box."""
Type new MyCustomFilter() in the text field
and click OK.
"""To make the custom code work, we will write the MyCustomFilter class."""
This inner or outer class will extend the fileFilter class.
I will copy and paste this code snippet
"""into the source of our class, below the import statements."""
Right-click the JFileChooserDemo project in the Project window and select Run to start the sample project.
"""In the Run Project dialog-box, select the jfilechooserdemo.resources.JFileChooserDemo main class."""
"""In the running Demo Application, choose Open in the File menu to trigger the action."""
Open any text file to display its contents in the text area.
Let me select the Sample.txt file and choose Open.
The fileChooser displays the contents of the text file.
"""To close the application, select Exit in the File Menu."""
"""In this tutorial, you learnt to:"""
Add a File chooser to a Java application and
Configure the File chooser.
As an assignment- use the same demo project we have created and add the following features:
Add a Save menu item under the menu bar.
Add keyboard short-cuts for all the menu items.
"""Add a code snippet to the Save action, to save the file."""
I have already created a similar assignment where the file chooser displays the Save option under the File menu
and gives you the option to save the text file which you open.

"""It is available at no cost, to both academic and industrial users."""
Information about installation and download is given at the following link. http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/download.html
Now we have generated input files for GAMESS and Gaussian programmes.
These input files are ready to be loaded into respective programmes.
Viewers please note: Gaussian is a commercial software.  Hence I will not be able to show the interface to load the input file.
As mentioned earlier GAMESS is free software.
"""Those interested can download GAMESS software from the given link. And, load the input file to generate the output file. http://www.msg.ameslab.gov/gamess/download.htm"""
I have some Gaussian and GAMESS output files on the desktop.

Let's view these output files in avogadro.
Open a new Avogadro window.
Click on open icon in the tool bar.
Navigate to the file location. Select Benzene.log
"""The file opens, we can see the structure of benzene on the panel."""
Benzene.log was generated using Gaussian.
It contains information about molecular orbitals and C-C and C-H bond stretching.
Sometimes the log file may not show orbital information.
In such case open the .fchk file provided in the codefiles.
"""To view the orbitals, click on the orbital name from the list."""
"""If you want to change the display of orbitals, click on the spanner symbol next to surfaces option in the display types."""

"""This video summarizes the Spoken Tutorial project. If you do not have good bandwidth, you can download and watch it."""
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Abstract Classes.
"""In this tutorial, we will learn about:  Abstract Methods and Concrete Methods"""
Abstract Classes and Concrete Classes and
How to use Abstract Classes.
"""For this tutorial, I am using: Ubuntu 12.04 JDK 1.7 and Eclipse 4.3.1"""
"""To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of basics of Java and Eclipse IDE."""
You should also have the knowledge of subclassing in Java.
"""If not, for relevant Java tutorials, please visit the link shown."""
First we will see about Abstract Method.
An Abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.
It is declared using abstract keyword.
There should not be opening and closing parenthesis for this method.
Let us understand the usage of Abstract class with a sample program.
Now we will switch to Eclipse and create a new project called AbstractDemo.
"""Inside this project, we will create the necessary classes to demonstrate the usage of Abstract class."""
"""Now, right-click on src folder and click New > Class."""
Type the name of the class as Person and press Enter.
Now we will add the fields to represent the name and the age of the Person. Type:  String name semicolon.
Also type:  int age semicolon.
Now click on Source and select Generate constructor using fields.
Delete the super keyword from the generated code.
The constructor can initialise the values of name and age fields.
Next we will see about concrete method.
A Concrete method is completely implemented within the curly brackets.
We will add a concrete method to this class to print the name and age.
Type the following code as displayed on the screen.
"""This method showBasicDetails() illustrated here, is an example of concrete method."""
Observe that this method is implemented completely.
Now we will add an abstract method to this class.
"""So, type: public void showDetails( ) semicolon."""
"""An error comes up, since we have not yet added the abstract  keyword."""
"""So, now add the keyword abstract."""
Now we can see another error comes up.
"""This is because, abstract methods can be added only to abstract classes."""
"""So, now add the keyword abstract to the Person class to make it an abstract class."""
The class Person illustrated here is an abstract class.
It contains an abstract method called showDetails().
The figure here represents an inheritance relation.
"""Here, the Person class is an abstract class."""
The Employee class and the Student class are subclasses of the Person class.
These subclasses can provide their own different implementations.
These are done by showDetails( ) method present in the Person class.
"""For example: ShowDetails() Method in the Employee class prints the Employee ID and the Salary, where as ShowDetails() Method in the Student class prints the Student Register Number and Grade."""
Then right-click on the default package and create another class called Employee.
"""Now to make this a subclass of Person class, type:  extends Person."""
"""Now, we can see an error comes up in the Eclipse IDE."""
It indicates that we should provide an implementation to the abstract method showDetails( ).
We will do it a little later.
Now create two fields to represent the employee id and employee salary.
"""So, type:  String empid semicolon and int salary semicolon."""
Now click on Source and then select Generate constructor using fields.
"""This constructor can initialize the values of name, age, empid and salary."""
"""Let us now define the showDetails method. So, type: public void showDetails( )."""
"""Inside this method, we need to print the employee details."""
Type the following code as displayed on the screen.
"""Note that the error disappears, once the showDetails() method is implemented."""
Next we will see a Student class of the project.
I have already created a subclass called Student.
There are two fields in the Student class – register number and grade which represent student register number and grade.
A constructor is also created inside this class.
"""This constructor can be used to initialize the values for name, age, register number and grade."""
The showDetails method is also implemented in this class.
It prints the values of Student Register Number and grade.
Now note that the Employee class has its own implementation of showDetails().
And the Student class has its own implementation of showDetails().
Now right-click on the default package.
Click on New > Class and then type name as Demo.
"""Inside this class, we will have the main method."""
"""So, type main and then press ctrl+space to generate the main method."""
Now let us try to instantiate the Person class by typing Person p equals new Person.
Within brackets and double quotes type John and put a semicolon.
Now we can see an error. This is because the Person class is abstract and it cannot be instantiated.
Let's remove this line.
Type the following code as displayed on the screen.
"""Now, let us instantiate the Person class using the Employee class as Person p1 equals new Employee."""
"""In the first line, we are passing the values of different arguments."""
John is passed as Employee name.
40 as the value of age.
E267 as the value of Employee ID and 10000 as the value of Employee salary.
Now we can invoke the concrete method in the Person class as p1.showBasicDetails().
We can also call the showDetails() method using the object p1 as p1.showDetails().
Similarly instantiate the Person class using the Student class.
This is represented as Person p2 equals new Student.
Now we are passing the values of different arguments.
We can invoke the showBasicDetails() method and showDetails() method using the object as shown.
Now let us run this Demo program.
"""So, right-click on the class Demo and then select Run as > Java Application."""
We can see the output with the basic employee details like name and age.
These are printed by showBasicDetails() method.
Other employee details like employee ID and salary are printed by the showDetails() method.
Similarly the basic student details like name and age are printed by showBasicDetails() method.
Other details of the student like Student register number and grade are printed by the showDetails() method.
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.
"""In this tutorial, we have learnt about: Abstract Methods and Concrete Methods"""
Abstract Classes and Concrete Classes and  How to create and use Abstract Classes.
"""As an assignment,  create an abstract class Vehicle which contains an abstract method run()."""
Create asubclass Car which extends the Vehicle class and implements the run method that prints “Car is running on 4 wheels”.
Also create asubclass Bike which again extends the Vehicle class and implements the run method that prints “Bike is running on 2 wheels”.
Also create a Demo class containing the main method to verify the results.

"""Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on taking User input in Java, using BufferedReader ."""
To take user input in Java
About InputStreamReader and BufferedReader.
"""To follow this tutorial, you must know"""
"""how to write, compile and run a simple java program in Eclipse."""
You must also know  about the data types in Java.
"""If not, please refer to the spoken tutorial on these topics available at spoken hyphen tutorial dot org."""
"""Here, I am using: Ubuntu v 11.10 JDK 1.6 and Eclipse IDE 3.7.0"""
"""Now, we will learn what a BufferedReader is!"""
It is a class in java which is used to read text from an input stream.
It provides efficient way to read array of characters and lines.
"""To make use of BufferedReader , we need to import three classes from the java dot io package."""
These three classes are: IOException InputStreamReader and BufferedReader
We will learn about packages and how to import classes in the coming tutorials.
Now how is the input taken?
All the input that we take from the user will be in the form of string.
It has to be then typecasted or converted to the particular data type.
We will see that while we write our program to take the user input.
"""Now, let us see the syntax to implement BufferedReader."""
"""Once you import the three classes, you need to create an object of InputStreamReader."""
You also need to create an object of  BufferedReader.
We will learn about this in detail when we write our program.
"""So, let us switch to Eclipse."""
I have already opened a class named InputBufferedReader.
We will begin with importing the java.io package.
"""So, type: before the class, import space java dot io  dot star semicolon."""
"""This will import the classes InputStreamReader, BufferedReader and IOException."""
"""Now,  we will make use of BufferedReader inside the main method."""
We need to throw an IOException in whatever method we use the BufferedReader.
"""So, right after the main method type: throws space IOException."""
"""Now, what does this mean?"""
Exceptions are errors which occur in Java when some unexpected circumstances occur.
To prevent Exception errors we make use of throws keyword.
Throws is a keyword which is used during Exception handling.
It is used whenever we know that Exception error will definitely occur.
"""When we use BufferedReader, exception error always takes place."""
To prevent Exception errors from taking place we make use of throws IOException.
We will learn about Exception Handling in the coming tutorials.
"""Now, we will create an object of InputStreamReader."""
"""For that, inside the main method type: InputStreamReader space isr equalto new space InputStreamReader parentheses."""
"""Within   parentheses, type: System dot in and then semicolon."""
InputStreamReader is a class in java which allows us to take the user  input .
"""System dot in tells the java compiler to take the input from the user, using keyboard."""
The input that System  dot in takes is stored in the object of InputStreamReader for sometime.
After this we create an object of BufferedReader.
"""So, type: BufferedReader space br equal to new space BufferedReader and then parentheses."""
"""Inside the parentheses, type the object of InputStreamReader which is isr."""
"""Now, isr only helps to take the input from the user."""
BufferedReader helps to store the value in the BufferedReader object.
Isr passes this value to the BufferedReader object to store it.
"""Now, let us start taking input from the user."""
We will first ask the user to enter a String. So create a variable of String type.
Type: String space str semicolon.
Now ask the user to enter his name.
"""So, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes Enter your name and then semicolon."""
To take the input as  String we will type:
str equal to br dot readLine parentheses and then semicolon.
The readLine method will read the input from the user.
"""Now, let us take the input as an integer. Create a variable of type int."""
"""So, type:  int n  semicolon."""
Ask the user to enter his age.
"""So, type: System dot out dotprintln within brackets and double quotes  Enter your age semicolon."""
"""Also, create another variable named str1 of String type in order to take the input."""
"""Now, to take the input as String, type: str1 equal to br dot readLine parentheses  and then semicolon."""
"""To convert it into integer datatype, type: n equal to Integer with capital I  dot parseInt, capital I within brackets str1 semicolon."""
Integer is a class and parseInt is its method.
This method converts the argument passed within the bracket into integer.
"""Now, let us display the output for  name and age."""
"""So, type: System dot out dot println within brackets and double quotes The name is plus str semicolon."""
"""Next line, type: System dot out dot println The age is plus n and then semicolon."""
"""Now,  Save the file, press Ctrl, S keys. Now let us run the program."""
"""So, press Control and F11 keys."""
"""In the output, you are asked to enter your name."""
"""So, type your name. I will type here Ramu,  press Enter."""
You will be asked to enter your age.
I will type here 20 and then press Enter.
We get the output as :
The name is  Ramu  And  The age is 20.
"""Thus, we know how to take an input from the user."""
In this tutorial we have learnt :
About InputStreamReader
About BufferedReader And Converting from String to the desired data type.
"""For self-assessment, take a float, byte and character input from the user and  then display the output."""
Also take a number as input and divide it by 3. Then display the output on the console.

Welcome to this spoken tutorial on working with regular files in Linux.
Files and directories together form the Linux File System.
"""In a previous tutorial, we have already seen how to work with directories. You can find the tutorial at this website."""
"""In this tutorial, we will see how to handle regular files."""
"""We have already seen in another tutorial how we can create a file using the cat command. For details, please visit this website."""
"""Let us see how to copy a file from one place to another. For this, we have the cp command."""
Let us see how the command is used.
"""To copy a single file, we type: cp space one or more of the [OPTIONs]... space the name of the  SOURCE file space the name of the destination file."""
"""To copy multiple files at the same time,  we write: cp space one or more of the [OPTIONs]...the name of the SOURCE files that we want to copy and the name of the destination DIRECTORY in which these files wo"
Let us now see an Example. First we open a terminal.
"""We already have a file named """"test1"""" in our home directory."""
"""To see what is in test1, we type  $ cat space test1 and press Enter."""
"""As we can see the content of test1 is shown. Now if we want to copy it into another file called test2, we would write: $ cp space test1 space test2 and press Enter."""
Now the file has been copied.
"""If 'test2' doesn't exist, it would be first created and then the content of 'test1' will be copied to it."""
"""If it already existed then it would be silently overwritten. To see the copied file, type:  cat test2 and press Enter."""
"""We can also copy files from and to different directories. For example- type:  cp space /home/anirban/arc/demo1  which is the name of the file that we want to copy, space  /home/anirban/demo2 and press Enter."
What this will do is that it will copy the file 'demo1' from source diretory- /home/anirban/arc/ to the destination directory- /home/anirban; it will copy to a file whose name is demo2.
"""To see that the 'demo2' is there, type: ls space /home/anirban and press Enter."""
"""And as you can see, here is demo2."""
"""Before moving ahead, let us clear the screen."""
"""If you want the file to have the same name in the destination directory, you may not even mention the file name. For example-"""
Type: cp space /home/anirban/arc/demo1 space /home/anirban/ and press Enter.
This will again copy the file 'demo1' presenting the /home/anirban/arc/ directory to /home/anirban directory to a file whose name will be 'demo1' as well.
"""As before, to see the demo1, type: ls/home/anirban and press Enter."""
"""And, as you can see the demo1 file is there."""
"""Again, before moving ahead, let us clear the screen."""
Another instance when we do not need to give the destination file name is when we want to copy multiple files.
"""We assume that we have three files named test1, test2, test3 in our home directory."""
"""Now, we type:  cp space test1 space test2 space test3 space /home/anirban/testdir and press Enter."""
"""This will copy all the three files named test1,test2 and test3 to the directory  /home/anirban/testdir without changing their names."""
"""To see that these files have actually been copied, we will type: ls space /home/anirban/testdir and press Enter."""
"""As you can see test1,test2 and test3 are present in this directory."""
"""There are many options that go with cp. Here, we will see only the most important of them."""
Let us first go back to the slides.
"""Among the options, -R (The capital R) is an important one. It causes recursive copying of an entire directory structure."""
Let us see an example.
Let us try to copy all the contents of the 'testdir' directory to a directory called 'test'.
"""For that, we would type: cp space testdir slash test and press Enter."""
"""As you can see from the output message,"""
normally we cannot copy a directory having  some contents directly with the 'cp command.
But using the -R (mius R ) option we can do this.
Now we type:  cp space -R(minus capital R) space testdir/ test and press Enter.
"""The files have now been copied. To see that the test directory actually exists, type: ls and press Enter."""
"""As you can see, the 'test' directory exists. Let us clear the screen."""
"""To see the contents inside 'test', type: ls test and press Enter."""
You can see the contents of the 'test' directory.
"""Now, we go back to the slides."""
"""We have seen if a file is copied to another file that already exists, the existing file is overwritten."""
"""Now, what if we inadvertently overwrite an important file?"""
"""To prevent anything like this to occur, we have the '-b' option."""
This makes a backup of each existing destination file.
We can also use the -i(interactive)option. This always warns us before overwriting any destination file.
"""Now, let us see how the mv command works."""
This is used for moving files. Now how is that useful?
It has two major uses.
It is used for renaming a file or directory.
It also moves a group of files to a different directory.
"""mv is very similar to cp which we have already seen. So, let us quickly see how mv can be used."""
We open the terminal and type: mv space test1 space test2 and press Enter.
This will rename the file named test1 which was already present in the home directory to a file named test2.
If test2 already existed then it would be overwritten silently.
"""If we want our warning before the file is overwritten,"""
we can use the  -i  option with the mv command.
Say we have another file named 'anirban'. This file we also want to renew as 'test2'.
We will type:  mv space  -i space anirban space test2 and press Enter.
"""As you can see, a warning is provided asking whether test2 should be overwritten or not."""
"""If we press 'y' and then press Enter, the file would be actually overwritten."""
"""Like cp, we can use mv with multiple files but in that case the destination should be a directory."""
"""Before moving ahead, let us clear the screen."""
"""Suppose we have 3 files named  abc.txt, pop.txt and push.txt in our home directory."""
"""To see their presence, type  ls and press Enter."""
"""Here are the files  pop.txt, push.txt and abc.txt. Let us clear the screen."""
Now we want to move these three files to a directory called testdir.
"""What we need to do is, type:  mv space abc.txt pop.txt push.txt and then the name of the destination folder which is testdir and press Enter."""
"""To see them, type:  ls testdir  and press Enter."""
"""You can see the files  abc, pop and push.txt."""
"""Now, let us see some options that go with mv'. Let us first go back to the slides."""
The  '-b' or '–backup' option is present with the mv command. It will backup every file in the destination before it is overwritten.
"""The '-i' (minus i) option that we have already seen, warns us before overwriting any destination file."""
The next command we will see is the rm command. This command is used for deleting files.
Go back to the terminal and type: ls testdir.
We can see a file name 'faq.txt' present. Say we want to delete it.
"""For this, we type:  rm space testdir/faq.txt and press Enter."""
This command will remove the file 'faq.txt' from the /testdir directory.
"""To see that the file has been actually removed or not, let us again press  ls space testdir and press Enter."""
We can no longer see the file 'faq.txt'.
We can use the rm command with multiple files as well.
The  testdir directory contains two files 'abc2' and 'abc1.'
"""Suppose, we want to remove these files- 'abc1' and 'abc2.'"""
"""For this, we would type:  rm space testdir/abc1 space testdir/abc2 and press Enter."""
This removes the files 'abc1' and 'abc2' from testdir directory.
"""To see that they have been removed, type: ls space testdir again. You can no longer see abc1' and abc2."""
Let us clear the screen before moving ahead.
"""Now, let us go back to the slides."""
Let us summarize what we just said.
"""That is, to delete a single file we write rm and then the name of the file."""
"""To delete multiple files, we write rm and the name of the multiple files that we want to delete."""
"""Now, let us look into some of the options of the rm command."""
"""Sometimes a file is write protected. Using rm will not delete the file then. In this case, we have the -f option which can be used to force delete a file."""
The other common option is the -r option. Let us see where these option are  useful?
Let us switch back to the terminal.
"""rm command is not normally used for deleting directories. For that, we have the rmdir command."""
But rmdir command normally deletes a directory only when it is empty.
What if we want to delete a directory that has a number of files and sub-directories inside?
Let us try the rm command to do this.
Let us type rm and the directory that we want to delete which is testdir and press Enter.
"""From the output message, we can see that we can not use the rm directory to delete 'testdir'."""
But if we combine the '-r' and '-f' options then we can do this.
Press  rm -rf testdir and then press Enter.
"""Now, the testdir directory has been successfully deleted."""
Let us now go back to the slides to study the next command-
the cmp command.
Sometimes we need to check whether two files are same. If they are same then we may delete one of them.
Also we may want to see whether a file has changed since the last version.
"""For these and many other purposes, we can use the cmp command."""
It compares two files byte by byte.
"""To compare 'file1' and 'file2', we would write cmp space file1 space file2."""
If the two files have exactly the same contents then no message would be shown.
Only the prompt will be printed.
If there are differences in their contents then the location of the first mismatch will be printed on the terminal.
Let us see how cmp works. We have two files named sample1 and sample2 in our home directory.
Let us see what they contain?
"""Type: cat sample1 and press Enter. It contains the text- """"This is a Linux file to test the cmp command""""."""
The other file sample2 will contain the text and to see that we will type: cat sample2 and press Enter.
"""It will contain the text- """"This is a Unix file to test the cmp command""""."""
Now we would apply the cmp command on these two files.
We will write: cmp space sample1 space sample2 and press Enter.
"""As we can see, the first difference between the two files sample1 and sample2 is pointed out."""
Let us clear the screen before moving ahead to the next command.
The next command we will see is the wc command.
"""This command is used to count the number of characters, words and lines in a file."""
"""We have a file named """"sample3"""" in our home directory."""
"""Let us see its contents. For that, we will type: cat space sample3 and press Enter."""
This is the content of sample3.
"""Now, let us use the wc command on this file."""
"""For that, we would write wc space sample3 and press Enter."""
"""This command points out that the file has 6 lines, 67 words and 385 characters."""
These were some of the commands that help us to work with files.
There are many more commands. Moreover each of the command that we saw has many other options.
I encourage you to see more about them using the man command.
This brings me to the end of this tutorial at last.
