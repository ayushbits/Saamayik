A  Melakartha  raga  is  one  which  has  all  7  swaras  and  has Aarohanam and Avarohanam in the correct sequential order
For a Janya raga, it is not necessary that it should contain all 7 swaras 
and may have its Arohanam / Avarohanam in the sequential order
(eg. Mohana, Hamsadhwani, Sree ragam etc.).
With  regard  to  the  7  swaras  as  mentioned  above
please  also understand that these 7 swaras are extended to make 12 more swaras and named 'Dwadasa swaras'
List  of  Dwadasa  swaras  are  as  given  below.
These  used  in different variations of combinations make up the 72 Melakartha ragas
A raga is a series of notes systematically arranged  which can bring out different experiences in a musician or a listener.
Even folk melody songs are set in some raga or other.
Some folk melodies are in mixed ragas
However  a combination of swaras which are pleasant to listen are known as ragas.
The  variants  present  in  the  aarohana  are  present  in  the avarohana too.
Ex: Hamsadhwani (Derived from Dheerashankarabharana,the 29th Melakarta).
Bhashanga  raga: A  raga  which  has  five  or  six  notes  in  its ascending and/or descending scale(s) taken from its parent raga
Arohana  - A  set  of  notes  (scale)  used  to  play ascending melodies.
Avarohana - A scale used to play descending melodies.
Any  of  what  western  theory  would  call  flattened  notes included in the raga.
Samaya - The  time of day when the raga would be played/sung.
Every raga has a route which is arranged by an Aarohanam (swaras  arranged  in  ascending  scale)  and  an Avarohanam (swaras arranged in descending scale).

It  occurs  due  to  the discharge of untreated pollutants into water bodies.
It not only affects plants and organisms living near the location of discharge but  also  travels  to  other  locations  through  transportation  of polluted water.
Addition  of  substances  that  change  the  quality  of  soil  by making  it  less  fertile  and  unable  to  support  life  is  called soil pollution

for this you can use  a  pencil,  pen,  crayon,  or  even  your fingers
In this  lesson  you  will  learn  about  the  basic  skills  of  drawing, drawing of shapes like circles and also understand the basics of colour.
Back then, materials  and  tools  were  not  that  important  to  us.
A  standard pencil on some notebook paper would often do the trick.
Wax  is  added  to  act  as  a  lubricant  and  help  the  pencil  slide smoothly over the paper.
inks  available  in  a  range  of  colours
an artist can have  a book with blank pages of drawing paper.
Since  a  sketchbook is recommended for daily practice
It might sound obvious, but make sure that the board is large enough for your paper and that its surface  is  smooth.
An  easel  is  an  upright  support  used  for displaying and/or fixing something resting upon it, 
normally standing up, and are also sometimes used to display finished paintings.
You can also use a small knife to sharpen your pencils  8.
Fountain  or  cartridge  pens,  roller-ball,  ballpoint,  fine  liners, and specialist art pens come with a wide range of nibs 
It takes a lot of practice to become  good  at  something.
A  skill  is  something  taught  and learned
For someone  who  does  not  know  how  to  draw,  they  can  gain instruction and develop skill, even to a high level of expertise.
but  they require a lot of practice to master.
There are standard drawing techniques that you need to be familiar with as you put pencil  to  paper.
Some  are  so  basic  that  you've  probably  used them before without even realizing it.
you learn to control your hand and  to see.
Lines that are close  together  will  look  darker,  while  lines  further  apart  will indicate  highlights.
Now  make  sure  to  try  other  directions  as well.
This  technique  is  the  logical  extension  to hatching.
Experiment  with  curved  lines  and  you'll understand about graceful movements and fluffy figures.
Understanding  shapes  is  important  because  when  combined together,  they  can  form  the  foundations  to  a  more  complex drawing.
In short, everything you see in life can be drawn easily and properly  when  you  understand  that  they  can  be  visualised  as various shapes put together.
That's why you should understand how light and shadows play with each other to learn where to put the dark areas on  your  drawing.
Understanding Perspective Combining  your  knowledge  and  experience  on  the  above discussed  basic  elements  of  drawing
Colour  theory  is  both  the  science  and  art  of  using  colour.
It explains how humans perceive colour; and the visual effects of how  colours  mix,  match  or contrast with each other.
Colour theory also involves the messages colours  communicate;  and  the methods used to replicate colour.
Colour  is  perception.
Objects in  different reflect combinations  of  wavelengths.
Our  brains  pick  up  on  those  wavelength  combinations  and translate them into the phenomenon we call colour.
The colour wheel consists of
a line through the center of the wheel, and you'll separate the  warm  colours  from  cool  colours.
 reds, oranges, yellows are warm colours while blues, greens, purples are considered as  cool colours.
When  you  recognize  that  colour  has  a  temperature,  you  can understand how choosing all warm or all cool colours can impact your message.
 Simply  put,  tints,  tones  and  shades  are  variations  of  hues,  or colours, on the colour wheel.
A shade is a hue to which  black  has  been  added.
For  example,  red  +  black  = burgundy.
a tone is a colour to which black and white (or grey)  have  been  added.
This  darkens  the  original  hue  while making the colour appear more subtle and less intense.
Dear student, in the last lesson you learned about fire protectionin Vedas. In this lesson you will learn about the sky i.e. space.
In the proposed text, we will study many things related to space, such as - aboutthe Sun, Moon and stars, the difference of stars and planets, therelationship between the Sun and the planets, the formation ofday and night, etc.
If  we  look  at  the  expanse  of  the  sky,  from  theatmosphere around the earth, it is infinite.
All the planets, satellites, solar system and much Akash(sky) Ganges are foundin space extending beyond the same atmosphere.
Our Akash(sky) Ganga is one of these many  Akash (sky) Gangesspread in space.
We also know Akash (sky) Ganga as 'Kshir Sagar' and in English it is called'Milky Way' i.e. 'River of Milk'.
The sun, moon and stars have a very important role in people'slife.
It rises  in  the  morning  and  sets  in  the  evening.
Later  it  was discovered that the Earth revolves around the Sun on its axis,while the Sun remains still at one place.
Days and nights are  formed only when the earth revolves around the sun.
In this way, nature and human life have been created by the interconnection of the sun,moon, earth and stars.
Let  us  now  try  to  understand  the  solar  system  through  theinteraction of teachers and students.
When sir entered a class, he had a globe in his hand. He startedobserving it very carefully.
We have seen this many times, it is placed on the table of the Principal, the childrenanswered in one voice.
You must have brought to teach us  geography  today,  Radha replied immediately.
What is this solar system, sir?Gopal asked.Now everyone tell! Well, everyone must have seen the sun,moon, earth and stars! sir asked.
I see many stars on the roof every day before sleeping. I try tocount them as well, Vivek said.
Today I will teach about it.Sir raised the globe and showed it to everyone - Our earth isround like this and it rotates in this way, tilting on its axis.
It also revolves.This revolution of the Earth is completed in 365 days. . 
No, there are seven more planets besides Earth - Mars,Mercury,Jupiter,Venus,Saturn,Uranus  and  Neptune,which revolve around the sun.
All these planets get their  shine  only  from  the  sun.The  bodies that orbit(revolve)around these planets are called satellites.We can call them the Sun's own family.
Well, those who orbit(revolve) the Sun, get light from it, theplanets, and the planets that revolve around satellites, Gopal said.
Got it all right.Do satellites revolve around the Earth as well? Arstu asked.
Like Mars have 2 satellites, 8 of Neptune, 23 Because the moonrevolves  around  the  earth,  that's  why  it  is  also  seen  by  us,sometimes hiding and moving out.
But sir, why is there a difference in its size? Sometimes it lookslike a plate; sometimes it is incomplete like a laugh.
But sir, why is there a difference in its size? Sometimes it lookslike a plate; sometimes it is incomplete like a laugh.
When it starts decreasing it is completely hidden,then there is Amavasya(lunar phase) andwhen it shines completely in the sky,that night is the full moon night.
The  dates  of  the  Indian calendar are based on these.
There are many stars in them, which are much larger thant he Sun intheir size,sir said.
Yes, it is right that the pole star in the north direction remains ina stable position and near those seven stars there is a cluster ofstars, which is named as Sapta Rishi, sir told.
Sir, sometimes a white milky way of star appears in the sky,what is that?Arstu asked.
It is called Akash Ganga(milky way). Sometimes, the shootingstar also appear in the sky, sir explained, then said- All ourplanets, satellites, constellations and stars etc. revolve in space,ie the sky.
Space means the sky, which has no end, thus youknow that all the planets including the earth rotate in the sky, sothey cannot rest on anything.
Sir you just told us that the Sun is a star, so why doesn't it showup at night? The stars shine  at night don't they? Raju asked.
Then now must have know the truth that the sun does notactually go anywhere, nor does it come from anywhere.
It also  revolves  around  the  sun  rotating  on  its  tilted  axis, sirreminded.
That is why night and day are made.I have told you that the sunshines steadily at one place.
The light which falls on the part of the earth there the day comes out, sir said, placing a part ofthe globe in front of the lighted bulb -
Look, the part of the globe which is In front of this bulb isshining with light, while the shadow of the bulb is seen on theback of the globe.
Thus, the light does not reach this back part. Meaning, the part which is hidden behind, has no light. It isconsidered night there, Gopal said.
Exactly, the Earth rotates on its axis in 24 hours.This formsnight and day.
Likewise, in the rest part, the night occurs. Thus,it is 12 hours a day and 12 hours a night.
Seven days are there in a week.The days of the week are also named according to theseconstellations.
Sir; Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday arethe names of the planets, but on what basis are the names Sundayand Monday?
Why, don't you know that the Sun itself is called Ravi, it isnamed after Sunday?
The day and night occur by rotation of the earth and the sun;likewise, the seasons occur by rotation.
But, you were talking about how seasons occur? Vivek said,interrupting in the middle.
Yes, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is differentduring this orbit (revolution).
Due to the rotation of the cycle of seasons is formed. 
The  temperature  of  the  Earth  changes  due  to  the  increasingdistance between the Sun and the Earth. A mixture of these twoforms the other four seasons. These are called spring, monsoon,autumn and pre-winter, sir told.
• Due to the rotation of the earth on its axis, seasons are formeddue to day and night and revolution.
• The moon shines with its light.                                (  )
• The Earth revolves around the Sun.                     (  )
• The one that revolves around the Sun is called a satellite.    (  )
• The part of the Earth which is facing the Sun, there occurs a day.    (  )   
• The seasons are formed by the rotation of the Earth's around the Sun.  (  )
• The part of the Earth that is close to the Sun is hot.    (  )
• There are four seasons in a year.      (  )
(4) In the night, see big dipper(Sapta Rishi), Milky Way(Akash Ganga) or shooting star (Punchchal Tara), polestar (Dhruva Tara). Where does it appear? What is it's time?
2. The one who shines with his own light is called a star.The one who receives its light  from the stars are calledplanets.

CONSERVATION OF FIRE(ENERGY) IN VEDAS
Dear student, in the last lesson you read about fire i.e. energy. Inthis lesson you will read about the importance of conserving fire(energy) in the Vedas. In the Vedas, fire has been considered asthe basic platform for the creation of the environment.
That is, one who wishes to keep the fire awake, he has knowledgeabout  the  Samaveda.
Knowledge  and  happiness  are  attained.
(3)  Ordinary (Dyosthani) Fire
The  fire  on  earth  is  called  earthly  fire.  Local  electric  fire  isconsidered as space and solar fire as ordinary fire.
While enlightening the importance of fire, the sage of the Rigvedaprays to space fire to protect us from the disturbances of space.
It means that the sun should protect us from celestial disturbances;wind from space disturbances and fire from earth's disturbances.
Pointing to the importance of solar energy, the kaanv sage of theRigveda says that the Continuous energy is received from the Sun -
The energy of this sun (solar energy) is currently very important,so we need to pay attention to solar energy.
Sage  Gritsamad (x`rLen) of the RigVeda states that energy is produced by the rays of the sun which have the power to burn instantly.
It is said in the Rigveda that the Sun makes the Som (lkse) strong.The earth also gets stronger with Som (lkse).
In this context, Som (lkse) means the Moon at some places andSomalata at some places means the gas(Hydrogen, Helium) atsome point in reference to the Sun.
Here the meaning of Som (lkse) can be derived from hydrogen and helium gas, because Som (lkse)transmits energy from the Sun.
It is said in the Yajurveda that the element of water is establishedin the sun -
Here, the Sun of Water is (upholder). Proper combination ofhydrogen and oxygen.From the point of view of Sage above,theelement of water indicates hydrogen and the element of hydrogenonly indicates helium.
Fire means oxygen here, Som (lkse) means hydrogen. In this way,the combination of the two can be considered as indicated in theAtharvaveda.
In the Yajurveda, indicating the importance of the energy of theSun, it is said that; the Sun is the energy given by you and theenergy generated by that energy is the accomplishment of deeds,so you should combine us in the best deeds.
3. What does  “अग्निमीले पुरोहितम्”  mean?
Dear student, in the last lesson you've learned Vedic opinion aboutthe  creation.
In this lesson you will be able to get generalinformation about the five great elements.
The  creation  has originated from these five great elements. On this subject, youcan also talk to your parents, grandparents or any elder memberof the family.
Earth, water, fire, air and sky are called the fivegreat elements.
• to understand the  power (existence) of the great elements.
The word bhut is formed by the sum of the kt affixes in bhusattayam  (ground  metal).
Bhut  means  one  who  has  power (existence) or one who exists.
Bhut are not the work of any other person, that is, there is no reason for their origin, but the existenceof everything else as a factor cause of the great elements.
According to Maharishi Charak, these great elements are verysmall and difficult to identify by the senses.
Because  of  their  importance  or  grossness,  they  are  known  asmahabhuta.
The  body  and  non  living  substances  of  all  livingbeings are made from them.
These are the five  great elements:
Sky-  The  sky  has  been considered to be eternal. Oneof the the properties of the sky is-shabd.
Just  as  the  sky  is eternal, so is its property  -shabd is also everlasting.
Wind-  The  origin  of  air  is  assumed  to  be  from  the  sky.
“आकाशातद्वायु:  ” air is also considered to be eternal.
All three qualities are eternal. Such arethe three properties of fire.
Water  has  shabd,  touch,  form  and  taste  properties.
All  four properties are eternal.
Apart from the above basic essential properties, there are someother  characteristics  in  these  mahabhutas    which  we  can  feelthrough  our  senses,  for  example  in  the  earth,  water,  light,  airrespectively, we can infer the characteristics of smell, liquidity,consistency etc.
Similarly, we can see the experience of resistancein the sky.
The manifestations of Sattva, Rajas, Tamas qualities are describedin the five great elements.
As per the nature of their qualities, the predominance of sattva quality in the sky, rajo quality in air, sattvaand rajo quality in fire, sattva and Tamas qualities in aap (water)and tamas quality in the earth can be seen.
Dear student, in this lesson you will be able to know the originof creation in the light of our ancient knowledge tradition.
In the RigVeda, many sages like Prajapati, Parmeshthi Narayanaand dhirghatama have described the initial stage of creation.
In our RigVeda, there is mention of creation in Nasadiya Suktaand Purusha Sukta.
According to the Purusha Sukta, the creationof  the  universe  has  originated  from  the  Virat  Purush.
 In  the Purusha Sukta, Narayan Rishi has described the creative powerand omnipresence of the supreme power:
It the above hymn it is said that the Almighty God is the one withthousands of heads, thousands of eyes and with thousands offeet, he is present in the whole universe.
God, who is the creatorof the world, has surrounded the whole nature in all its forms.
Here  the  creation  of  theuniverse is told through the working powers of the Almighty.
It means that the two birds are sitting side by side on the sametree.
One of these two birds tastes the fruits of that tree while theother bird is not eating the fruits and doing a subtle inspection ofthe movements of the first bird eating those fruits. The first birdin it is the metaphor of the person who is doing the deeds whilethe second one observing the bird is the metaphor of the divine,who is closely observing the movements of that first bird in orderto give fruit according to its deeds. From this hymn, it is expressedthat there are two major elements in the creation of the universe.
second  element  is  so  subtle  that  it  is  irresistible.
This  is  themetaphor of subtle invisible nature.
The third element is the onein which nature is embraced. This third element is the omnipotentSupreme Power, my beloved deity.
Breathing  exercises  are  systematic  practices,.
It  include physical movements with breath awareness.
We can  live  for  months  without  consuming  food  and  a  few  days without  water.
However  we  can  only  survive  a  few  minutes without breathing.

Maharshi  Patanjali  starts  the  yoga  sutra  by  telling  that  now discipline of yoga are being explained and he moves on to next Sutra.
The causes for  pain  are Avidya  (Ignorance), Asmitha  (I-feeling),  Raga (Liking), Dvesha (Disliking) and Abhinivesha (Fear).
By  slight  effort  and  meditating  on  the  unlimited,  the  posture becomes firm and pleasant.
Controlling  the  motion  of  the  exhalation  and  the  inhalation follows after doing asana.
Pranayama’s  modifications  are  either  external  or  internal,  or motionless.
An  unbroken  flow  of  concentration  without  any  deviation  is dhyana.
Yoga  is  destroyed  by  the  following  six  causes:
The policeman looked at Kabir’s face and  he did not take him seriously and left from there.

Karma Yoga  -    this  is  about  selfless  action  without  an attachment to the results.
Do  it  by  work  (Karma Yoga),  worship  (Bhakti Yoga), philosophy (Jyana Yoga) or psychic control (Raja Yoga) by any one or two or all of these and be free”.
practice  Karma Yoga,  Raja Yoga,  Bhakti Yoga  and  Jnana Yoga.
It is born  of  ignorance  and  the  cause  of  delusion.
 It  binds  us through recklessness, laziness and sleep.
Pranayama  -  Breathing exercises
Lord Krishna explains this aspect  in Bhagavad Githa:
Elevate  yourself  through  the  power  of  your  mind,  and  not degrade yourself, for the mind can be the friend and also the enemy of the self. BG 6.5
In today’s time if we are suffering from various problems, suffering from  ill  health,  tensions  and  stresses,  these  are  of  our  own making. 
We  all  possess  that  “will”  power  as  a  manifestation  of  that freedom is in ourselves. Thus, Raja Yoga is to use that will power and elevate ourselves.
 The origin of  Bhakti  can  be  seen  in  the  Upanishads,  specifically  the Shvetashvatara Upanishad. 
Those  devotees  are  very  dear  to  me  who  are  free  from  hatred toward all living beings, who are friendly, and compassionate. They are free from attachment to possessions and egotism, equipoised in happiness and distress, and ever-forgiving. BG 12.13
All  cares,  worries  and  anxieties,  fears,  mental  torments  and tribulations entirely vanish.
Shanta  Bhava:  The  devotee  is shanta  or  peaceful.
He  does  no jump  and  dance.
Bhishma  was  a Shanta Bhakta.
DasyaBhava:  It  is  about  being  a servant of god. Lord Hanuman was a  Dasya  Bhakta.  He  had  Dasya Bhava, servant attitude.
SakhyaBhava:  God  is  a  friend  of the devotee. Arjuna had this Bhava towards Lord Krishna. They both used to sit, eat, talk and walk together as close friends.
Vatsalya Bhava: The devotee looks upon God as his child. Yashoda  had  this  Bhava  with  Lord  Krishna.  The  devotee serves, feeds, and looks upon God as a mother does in the case of her child.
Bhakti is bliss and more blissful would be our lives when we cultivate and practice the above discussed Navavidha Bhakti or nine  forms  of  devotion  in  our  journey  of  life  towards  theSupreme.
Manana: After  hearing  a lecture,  you  must  start cognizing  about  it,  then logically try to understand it,  repeat  that  again  and again, questioning it to themaximum possible extent which is  called Manana.
Experiencing true knowledge through Jnana yoga allows the student to know God and  be liberated.
Although Hatha yoga begins with the Annamaya Kosha, if performed correctly, the practices of Hatha yoga impact the subtler Pranamaya (Vital force), Manomaya (Mental) and Vijnanamaya (Intellectual) Koshas  as well.

.  VIBHUTI  PADA
(These)  three  (when  practised)  in  regard  to  one  object  is Samyama.
By the suppression of the disturbed modifications of the mind, and by the rise of modifications of control,the mind is said to attain  the  controllingmodifications  -  followinghe  controlling powers ofthe mind.
By making Samyama on word, meaning, andknowledge, which are  ordinarily  confused,  comes  theknowledge  of  all  animal sounds.
By  making  Samyama  on  the  form  of  the  body  thepower  of perceiving forms being obstructed, thepower of manifestation in the eye being separated, theYogi's body becomes unseen.
On  the  light  emanating  from  the  top  of  the  head  sightof  the Siddhas.
From  that  arises  the  knowledge  of  hearing,  touching,seeing, tasting, and smelling, belonging to Pratibha.
When the cause of bondage has become loosened, theYogi, by his  knowledge  of  manifestation  through  theorgans,  enters another's body.
From  that  comes  minuteness,  and  the  rest  of  the  powers, glorification of the body, andindestructibleness of the bodily qualities.
By  the  similarity  of  purity  between  the  Sattva  and  thePurusa comes Kaivalya.
Maharshi Patanj\ali was a great sage who had compiled all the 195  Yoga Sutras at Rudraprayag,  a  hilly  district  in Uttrakhand,   1700 years ago.

.  KAIVALYA  PADA
(The others are held in abeyance for the timebeing.) There  is  connectiveness  in  desire,  even  thoughseparated  by speices, space and time, there beingidentifi-cation of memory and impressions.
The  object  ofperception  is  not  dependent  on  the  chitta;  what would happen to the object of perception when the medium of cognition is not there? Things are known or unknown to the mind, beingde-pendent on the colouring which they give to themind.
The  essence  of  knowledge  (the  Purusa)  beingun-changeable, when the mind takes its form, itbecomes conscious.
The resolution in the inverse order of the qualities,berfect of any motive  of  action  for  the  Purusa,  isKaivalya,  or  it  is  the establishment of the power ofknowledge in its own nature.
. The  change  into  another  species  is  by  the  filling  in of………..(Sutra  . )

Games  play  an  important  part  in  creating  awareness, concentration and attention.
learn Yogic games which will help the children to develop their awareness, concentration and attention abilities and   develop speed, creativity and group co-ordination that will improve memory, IQ and creativity skills.
It has been found that learning through playing games has a number of necessary qualities, one of these being  their  attention-focusing  quality.
Games  tend  to  focus attention more effectively than most other teaching devices.
Speak  and  more  importantly  listen  to  your  team  mates, coaches to get an understanding of who they are.
(i) Variation  : In this game, all the instructions for right side action to be ignored.
(ii)  Variation  : In this game, action opposite to what is told is to be performed.
So for example, if there are   people playing, you should have   chairs in a circle.
As  soon  as  the  music  starts  playing,  the  players  walk  in a  circle  around  the  chairs.
You  can  choose  whether to  go  clockwise  or  counter-clock-wise,  but  all  players should go the same direction following the person in front of them.
The  player  that  didn't  find  a  chair  to  sit  it  is  out  of  the game.
The last round will be   players and one chair.
Wherever     and  its  multiples  comes,  the  players  will  say 'HARI'   wherever   and its multiples comes the players will say 'OM'.
Wherever multiples of   and   comes, the players will say hari -om (  ,  0.  . 0….). The player who tells the actual number will be out.
When Shiva asked, Bhasmasura said,  Lord, please grant me the wish that whichever person, place or thing I place my right hand on, is reduced to ashes.
 Lord  Shiva  granted  him  the  boon  and  Bhasmasura  was  very happy.  Having got the boon, the wicked Bhasmsura tried the boon on Shiva himself. As  a  result,  Shiva  started  running from  Bhasmasura  to  save  himself. Seeing  Shiva's  plight,  Lord  Vishnu decided  to  help  him.  He  changed himself  into  a  beautiful  young maiden,  called  Mohini,  instead. He was attacked by Mohini's beauty and asked  her  to  marry  him. Mohini agreed to marry him, but she had a condition. She asked Bhasmasura to touch his head and promise her that he  would  not  marry  again  if  she became  his  wife.  Bhasmasura  agreed. As  soon  as  the  foolish demon touched his head, he was reduced to ashes. That is how Vishnu succeeded in saving Shiva from Bhasmasura.     Each participant will try to keep his right hand on another's head as the Bhasmasura did and say Bhasma, (Ash).
When the umpire says 'RAM' everybody keeps their palms  open  facing  upwards.
When  umpire  says  'SHYAM' everybody  twists  the  palms  downwards  facing  the  ground.
Umpire  may  say  'RAM  OR SHYAM' in any order he likes or  any  speed.
Accordingly with  full  awareness  players twist their palms.
Divide the participants into several groups consisting of not more than 10   in a group.
Instruct  them  that   30  minutes  time  will  be  given  for preparation.
The time allotted on the stage for each group is just 5  or 6 minutes.
There  is  a  pleasure  in  dexterity  where  the  complexity  of  the movement becomes second nature to the point where the person responds  without  having  to  think  about  how  they  move themselves, much as a driver does not think about where to move their hands or feet.
III. LEG CRICKET   Two teams will be formed.
A pot will be kept on a fixed pole at a distance of 20  to 3 0' from the line.
At first all the players are allowed to  measure  the  distance  (by number  of  their  steps)  between the spot where they stand and the pole.
A   ft. long stick is given to each of them by turns to break the pot with one swing.
When the game begins by a whistle's blow all those who are fish will start running through the nets. When  a  second  whistle  is  blown  ask  the  nets  to  close  by bringing their hands down.
These two words were always recited by many freedom fighters of India when they were hanged by the Britishers.
. Thus, the song 'Vande Mataram' reminds us of their sacrifice.

Shri as contained in Rig-Veda Shi Suktam is primarily meant to mean - a non-deficient, non-exiguous, non-sparse -  want-less-syndrome;

But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all  embodied  beings;  it  binds  fast,  O  Arjuna,  by heedlessness, sleep and indolence!
Sattwa attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while  Tamas,  shrouding  knowledge,  attaches  to heedlessness only!
When,  through  every  gate  (sense)  in  this  body,  the wisdom-light shines, then it may be known that Sattwa is predominant.
Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, longing—these  arise  when  Rajas  is  predominant,  O Arjuna!
From Sattwa arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness  and  delusion  arise  from  Tamas,  and ignorance also.
The embodied one, having crossed beyond these three Gunas out of which the body is evolved, is freed from birth,  death,  decay  and  pain,  and  attains  to immortality.

Three types of  nature.
He provides anything you need,  he protects the family, he gives  you  emotional  support  almost  he  is  like  an all-rounder for you.
When you grow, capable of handling things yourself,  just your  parents  are  not  everything.
You  can  see  teachers, managers, principals and village Panchayat officials etc. who are just more than capable than your parents.  However, there can be no one who cares you more than your parents or parent-like caring people, is it not?
The body of capable of doing everything is called Purusha  in  Vedas.

From mahavishnu  was born the Virat
he is the one Making  this Virat  as  the  substratum   purusha
As  soon  as  he  was  born,  he multiplied himself. Later, he created this earth and then, the bodies (of the living beings).
When the devas performed a yajna, using the Purusha as the havis for the yajna, the Vasanta became the ajya, the Grishma  served as idhma and  the sharad  filled the place of havis 
From that yajna  wherein the Cosmic Being was Himself the oblation, was produced the prasajta 
From  (His)  navel  was  produced  the  antariksha  (the  space between the earth and the heavens).
I know his great Purusha ,  the  wise  one,  who,  having  created  the various forms and the nomenclatures , deals with them by those names, and who is beyond darkness and is brilliant like the sun.
The gods worshiped  yajna through yajna

Many  great Acharyas lead by Sankara Bhagavat Pada,. But this again was done in Sanskrit. With the modern civilization several translations of this stotra is available in English and in almost all major languages of India.

The  melodies  of  Indian  music  are  based  on  ragas (in southern India, ragam). 
The  rhythms  of  Indian  music,  rather  than  being organized into short measures, are organized in long rhythmic cycles called talas (in southern Indian thaalam). There are more than 106 different talas. 
Taal or Talas, literally a  clap,  is  the  term  used  in  the  Indian  Carnatic  music  for  the rhythmic pattern of any composition and for the entire subject of rhythm. 
Each such pattern has its own name.  Each repeated cycle of Taal is called as avartana.
The  harmony  is  mainly  supplied  by  instruments such as the sitar, tanpura or santoor. 
Harmony in Indian classical music is mainly the result of the tanpura playing a combination of  the  tonic  (sa)  and  the  fifth  (pa)  or  fourth  (ma)  in  a  fixed pattern in the background.
The Tanpura instrument has four long  strings.
 The  strings  are  plucked  one  after  the  other, continuously throughout the music. 
It takes about 5 seconds for one four-string cycle to be plucked, and although the drone itself  is constant. 
The  combination  of  Raga  and  Tala  set  to  a  song  makes  the music.

India is the 7th largest country of the world in the terms of  size.
India  is rich in natural resources.
Earlier, Indian economy was based on  agriculture and agricultural products.
But with changes of time,  the nature of industry has been changed.
Now, the service industry  plays a major role in the Indian economy.
In this lesson, we will  study about the types of industries and their nature of work.
Our Industries  Small  and  large-scale  industries  help  in  the  development  of  the country.
They also provide employment to a large number  Notes  of  people.
Depending  upon  the  raw  material  used,  they  can  be  classified  as
Some  people  manufacture  articles  either  at  home  or  in  other  small  places  by  using  the  necessary  machinery.
Such  manufacturing units are called small-scale industries.
Leather  work industry, pottery, carpentry and handloom industry are some  examples.
Industries which undertake the manufacturing of goods on a large  scale by employing a large number of workers and using big  machinery  are  called  large-scale  industries.
Those  producing  sugar,  cement,  automobiles,  radio,  T.V. etc. are  large-scale industries
We  get  timber,  bamboo,  grass  and  medicinal  plants  from  the  forest.
Based on these products wooden articles, boxes, match- sticks,  paper  and  medicines  are  manufactured  by  industries.
Producing  oil  from  oil  seeds,  weaving  cloth  from  cotton,  producing sugar from sugar-cane, etc. are the industries based  on  agricultral  products.
Agriculture  itself  is  an  independent  profession.
Marble  tiles are produced form marble.
Cement is produced out of soft-  stone from mines.
This  includes  the  fishing  industry  and  aquaculture  plants.
Decorative articles are also prepared fromt he shells collected  from sand on the sea-shores.
Salt industry is also based on sea-  water.
It has connected  the  world.
Many  mediums  of  communication  i.e. Telephone,  mobile, internet, email etc has made life better.
Make  a  list  of  the  different  industries  operating  in  your  surrouding.
Visit  any  industry  in  your  surrounding  and  collect  information  about
India is a country where agriculture is the main profession of the  majority of the people.
Therefore, everyone must possess maximum information about  agriculture.
Even, if we are  not opting it as a profession in future, basic information will be  helpful in life.
Agricultural  operations  include  various  steps.
Ploughing  and  harrowing are done before sowing.
Once sowing is done, other  processes like irrigation, weeding, adding manures and fertilizers,  spraying of insecticides, cutting, harvesting, beating of cobs with  sticks, willowing and cleaning of grain, etc. are undertaken.
Then  the grains duly cleaned are stored in gunny or plastic bags and  sent to the market.
The farmers retain some of the grains for their  own domestic consumption.
It is very necessary to constantly watch the health and proper  growth of the crops.
For proper growth of crops it is necessary to provide manures and  fertilizers to the crops in the optimal doses.
It is also necessary to protect the crops  from birds and animals.
Spraying of insecticides and pesticides  helps protect the crops from insects and diseases.
There are mainly two types of crops depending upon the seasons  : Kharif crops and Rabi crops.
Crops that are sown at the beginning of the rainy season in the  month of June of July are called Kharif crops.
For example, bajra,  rice, moong, groundnut, cotton, etc.
Crops  that  are  sown  in  the  winter  season  and  cut  before  the  summer season are called Rabi crops.
For example, wheat, gram,  Notes  jowar etc.
Crops which grow on rain water are known as rain fed or Barani  Crops.
For example, bajra, groundnut, cotton, pulses etc.
Those  crops  which  need  irrigation  are  called  Irrigated  Crops.
For  example, sugra cane, banana, grapes, etc.
Observe the various crops grown in your surroundings in  different seasons and make a list of them.
Know  functions or different nutrients
describe  the  process  to  choose  different  food  rich  in  a  nutrient.
Hmm delicious  food.
What  is  being  cooked  in  your  house today?
These are :  Physiological function, Social function, Psychological function

In different foods,  cartain  substances  known  as  nutrients  are  found  in varying degrees.
There are five main nutrients found in all food stuffs. These  are  -  Carbohydrates,  Proteins,  fats,  mineral  and vitamins.
In  order  to  make  food  nutritious,  there  must  be  a balanced consumption of all these.
Ramu's  mother  is  a  very  good  cook.
Let  us  see  what  she has  cooked  today.
Dal,  Gobi Aloo  Sabzi, Parantha,  Curd and Kheer too!
Yes, they are : Carbohydrates,Proteins,Fats, Minerals  and  Vitamins
Hence, they form rich sources of these nutrients in our diet.
Each nutrient proforms an important  physiological  function.
Hence,  our  diet  must  be  a balance  mix  of  all  these  nutrients.
Following  functions  are performed by each nutrient
These  serve  as  the  major  source  of  body  building  material.
Main vegetarian sources  of  protein  are-Soyabean, pulses, cereals,milk, paneer, gound-nuts
describe  the  process  to  choose  different  food  rich  in  a nutrient.
Let  us  observe  the  cooking  process.
Some  foods  are  cooked  in  water,  and  others  in  oil.
Yet,  others  are  cooked  on  direct  flame.
Can  you  think  of  some  reasons for cooking food?
Take some wheat and try to eat it  raw.
Now take some wheat dough and Lets Cook  make a Roti.

Idlis  are steamed, samosas fried and pranthas roased on a tawa.
So  cooking can be with
Frying - Samosas
The question arises Why  is  cooking  done  by  various  methods?
it  done  by  various  methods  provides  variety  in  the  taste,  flavour  and  texture.
Let us list  down the methods of cooking with moist heat
Potato and rice are the two things which instantly  come to one's mind.
If  excess  water  is  discarded,  we  loss  all  the  water  soluble  nutrients.
If  it  is  covered  with  a  lid  the  steam  quickens  the  cooking  process
Use the left over liquid, rich in water soluble nutrients, for  making dals, curries, soups and for making dough.
the food to be cooked is not in contact with the  water
Idli, dhokla  and  vegetables  are  some  of  the  items  which  are  cooked  by  steaming.
Here the food is cooked in steam under  pressure.
The pressure cooker has a rubber gasket that seals the pain and  its lid
Since the steam is under pressure,  the temperature attained is much higher and the food is cooked  much faster.
The weight (whistle) controls the pressure built up  inside the cooker.
When the whistle blows, one should lower the  flame.
Thus, temperature is controlled in the cooker and food  does not get burnt.
This method is used  in
Food  is  cooked  in  a  tandoor  or  an  oven.
Heat  generated from the fire rotates around the food in the form of hot  air and this cooks the food.
Some examples of baked products  are - cakes, bread etc.
A cooker put inside down on the flame can also be used as a  Tandoor.
When  we  fry  pakoras,  puris  or  samosas,  they  are  completely  immersed in oil.
It is a quick  method of cooking.
How do we fry a parantha, dosa or an egg,a small amount of oil  is taken in a frying pan or tawa.
Food when put in cold  oil absorbs more oil
Before frying, cover the food item to be fried with a layer of  maida, suji, egg or besan.
This helps to increase the flavour  and the taste of the food being cooked.
Whatever oil is left after frying, should be strained and put in  a closed utensil

 In  the  forest  Sita  was abducted  by  Ravana,
  Rama  gathered  an  army  of    forest dwellers and bears to search for her. The allies attacked Lanka, killed Ravana and rescued Sita.

Born in the race of Janaka and daughter in law of Dasaratha,Sita,  beloved  spouse  of  Rama  is  like  his  vital  breath always  desired  the  wellbeing  of  Rama  she  followed  him  like Rohini, the Moon.
Rama  of  righteous  nature  having  approached  Guha,  king  of nishadas, at Shrungiberapura sent back charioteer Sumantra.
After Dasaratha had passed away, mighty Bharata did not desire to  rule  the  kingdom  against  the  orders  by Vasishta  and  other brahmins.
Bharata  reached  Rama,  so  pleasing  venerable,  truthful  and chivalrous, worshipped him with reverence and implored.
it is the command of dharmshastra You alone should be the king meaning that when the elder brother is  alive,  the  younger  brother  is  prohibited  from  ruling  the kingdom'.
although a source of universal delight, although exceedingly generous  and  of  cheerful  countenance,  highly  renowned  and capable Rama refused to accept the kingdom in accordance with the command of his father.
When Bharata departed, Sri Rama, a man of good fortune and steadfast  in  vows  one  who  had  conquered  under control perceiving that the citizens from Ayodhya would arrive there, entered the Dandaka forest with single minded determination .
Why  did Bharat go to fetest?
While Rama was dwelling in the forest, all the ascetics along with others  inhabiting the forest approached Rama  requesting for the destruction of the asuras and rakshasas seizing upon their lives.
Rama  promised  those  ascetics,  who  resembled  flaming  fire in lustre living in Dandakaranya inhabited by rakshasas to slay them.
During  his  stay  there  a  demon  called  Surpanakha  living  in Janasthana  (resting  place  for  the  army  of  Ravana  in Dandakaranya) and capable of assuming any form at will was rendered deformed by Lakshmana.
Thereafter  Rama  killed  in  the  fight  all  the  rakshasas,  Khara, Trisira, and Dushana with their followers in a battle who were instigated by Surpanakha's words.
During  his  stay  in  that  forest  Rama  killed  fourteen  thousand rakshasas who were inhabitants of Janasthana.
Having heard the slaughter of fellow rakshasa, Ravana became violent  with  anger  and  sought  the  help  of  a  rakshasa  named Maricha.

The best of monkeys (Sugriva) gathered his monkey forces and despatched  them  in  various  directions  in  search  of  Janaka's daughter (Sita).
After killing five commanders, seven sons of the counsellors,stamping  out  valiant Akshayakumara,  the  son  of  Ravana,Hanuman got himself captured (to be taken as captive).
The heroic Hanuman came to know that he could be released from the entanglements of the weapon granted to him through a boon by Brahma. He allowed himself to be restrained by the rakshasas  with  the  ropes  for  the  sake  of  achieving  his  other objective of seeing Ravana.

The  Bhagavad-Gita  is  a  conversation  between Arjuna  and Krishna, his charioteer.
Since, Bhagavad Gita is in the form of dialogue  between Arjuna and Krishna, in the beginning of this chapter Arjuna asks Krishna,'Who is the best devotee?
Summarize  teachings  of  Shri  Krishna  in  12th  Chapter  of Bhagavad Gita.
Sanskrit Alphabets origined from  the  sound  of  the  Damaru  of  the  Lord  Shiva  called Maheswara Sutras.
Mãhesvara Sutrani is fourteen verses that organize the phonemes of  Sanskrit  as  referred  to  in  the Astadhyayi  of  Panini,  the foundational text of Sanskrit grammar.
Hence the first  known  organized  sounds  are  known  as  the  Maheshvara Sutra - Maheshvara being another name of Lord Shiva.
At  the  end  of  his  cosmic  dance,  Shiva,  the  Lord  of  dance, with a view to bless the sages Sanaka and so on, played on his Damaru  fourteen  times,  from  which  emerged  the  following fourteen Sutras, popularly known as Shiva Sutras or Maheshvara Sutras
These  fourteen  sutras  contain  all  the  letters  of  the  sanskrit varnamala- the svaras (vowels) a, i, u, r, lr, e, ai, o, au and all the  vyanjanas  (consonants).
You  find  half  letters  in  the  end of each Sutra for a reason. As per the Rig Veda, Lord Siva brought this  Sanskrit  alphabet  sequence  and  the  Sanskrit  language  to earth.
Pratyahara is bringing together; bringing together of several letters (or words in a few cases, such as roots or nouns) by mentioning the first and the last only for the sake of brevity; the term izR;kgkj is generally used in connection with brief terms such as v.k~] vd~] vp~] gy~ and the like, created by Panini in his grammar by taking any particular letter and associating it with any mute final letter (vuqcU/k) of the fourteen Sivasutras, with a view to include all letters beginning with the letter uttered and ending with the letter which  precedes  the  (mute)  letter.
The  practice  of  using  such abbreviations  was  in  existence  before  Panini,  possibly  in  the grammar attributed to Indra.
Economy  (Sanskrit:  laghava)  is  a  major  principle  of  their organization,  and  it  is  debated  whether  Panini  deliberately encoded phonological patterns in them (as they were treated in traditional phonetic texts called Pratyhara) or simply grouped together phonemes which he needed to refer to in the Ashta dhyayi and which only secondarily reflect phonological patterns.
Hence  this  rule  replaces  a  vowel  with  its  corresponding semivowel when followed by any vowel, and that is why dadhi together with atra makes dadhyatra.
Mahesvara  Sutrani  are………..verses  that  organize  the phonemes of Sanskrit.
………………  brought  out  the  sequence  of  alphabets  of Sanskrita.
The  fourteen  sutras  contain  all  the  letters  of  the  Sanskrit varnamala- the svaras (Vowels) a, i, u, r, ir, e, ai, o, au and all the vyanjanas (Consonants).
These may be common goals, inner values  for the society and follow the right path to reach our goals. Our ancient texts are full with such values and suggesting the right ways to humankind.
There  was  a  mountain.  There  were  four  villages  around  the mountain;  Ramapura,  Bharatapura,  Lavapura  and  Kushapura.
They thought it's the representation of their village and there must  be a message for the villagers.
Ramapura had a path of stones and  jerky  way, Bharatapura  had  bushy  and  thorn  full  plants, Lavapura  had  high  trees  and  clear  path  and  Kushapura  had slippery path.

Hi, welcome to this spoken tutorial on General Purpose Utilities in Linux.
In this tutorial, we will make ourselves acquainted with some of the most basic yet heavily used commands of Linux.
Here, all commands and their options are in small letters unless otherwise mentioned.
This command is used to display some message on the screen. Switch to the terminal.
A general procedure to open a terminal is already explained in another spoken tutorial.
Type at the prompt: echo space Hello World and press Enter.
Type at the prompt: echo space dollar SHELL in capital and press Enter.
This outputs the present shell being used.
You may want to know what version of Linux Kernel you are running.
Sometimes your login password may get compromised and/or you may want to change it.
When that is correctly entered, you will have to enter your new password and then retype it to confirm.
We may be interested in knowing the system date and time. For this we have the date command.
It will show you the present system time and date.
It gives the name of the month.
It gives the last two digit of the current year.
Another related command is the cal command. Though not as common, this helps you to see the calender of any month and any year.
To see the current month's calendar, type at the prompt: cal and press Enter.
This gives the calendar of December 2070.
A directory helps us in organizing our files in a systematic manner .
Type the command ls and press Enter.
Now observe the output.
Files and sub-directories are generally shown with different colours.
It gives us the file permissions, file owner's name, last modification time, file size in bytes etc. Explanation of the fields of this option is beyond the scope of the present tutorial.
Instead of just displaying all these information on the screen, we may store it in a file. In fact we can store the output of any command in a file in this way.
