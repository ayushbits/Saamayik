"My  dear countrymen, Namaskar."
All of you are tuned into this episode of  ‘Mann Ki Baat ‘during the lockdown.
The number of suggestions and phone  calls for this episode is many times the usual.
"Matters close to your  heart; your own Mann Ki Baat, comprising a number of issues has reached  out to me."
"I’ve tried to the best possible extent to read them, listen  to them."
One has come to know of certain aspects which do not get  noticed during the course of this flurry of exigencies.
"I wish to touch  upon and share a few of those aspects with our countrymen in this ‘Mann  ki Baat’, taking place amidst a battle."
"Friends,  India’s fight against Corona is people-driven, in the truest sense of  the term."
"In India it is the people who are fighting the Corona; it is  you who are putting up a fight …..along with the people, the government  and the administration are fighting as well."
"A vast country such as  India, with its proactive endeavor on the path of development is  fighting a decisive battle against poverty."
This is the only medium it  possesses to fight the Corona and triumph over it.
"And we are fortunate  that today the whole country; each and every citizen of the country;  every person is a soldier in this battle; nay, leading the battle."
"In future when it will be dwelt upon in  hindsight; when ways and means will be reflected upon, I do believe that  India’s people driven fight will also be touched upon."
"Today at each  and every place, in neighbourhood lanes, people have come forward to  help each other."
"From food for the underprivileged, arranging rations,  ensuring lockdown, arrangements in hospitals to manufacturing medical  equipments indigenously…the entire country is marching ahead together in  the same direction, towards a single common objective."
"From metropolises to villages, it comes across as a  ’Mahayagya’ being performed in the realm of our national ethos where  every individual is eager to contribute."
"A case in point are our farmer  brothers and sisters – on the one hand , they are toiling day and night  amidst the scourge of the pandemic; on the other displaying due concern  to ensure that none in the country goes to bed hungry."
"Everyone is  putting up a fight, as per one’s capacity and ability."
There are some  who are waiving off rent; there are others depositing entire amounts  received through prizes and pension in PM CARES.
Some are donating  vegetables grown on farms; others are feeding a multitude of the under  privileged.
"Some are making masks; at places, our construction workers  are whitewashing and painting schools meant for their quarantine stay."
"And we have seen in recent years in our  country, this altruistic bent of mind is gaining strength…it could be in  the form of crores of people giving up Gas Subsidy, lakhs of senior  citizen leaving Railway Subsidy, leading the ‘Swachcha Bharat Abhiyan’  or getting toilets constructed …there are innumerable examples."
"All  these are reflective of the fact that we, our minds and hearts have been  intertwined along a common strong thread."
"My dear countrymen, with utmost  humility and deepest respect, I bow to this sentiment displayed by a  130 crore countrymen."
"To facilitate your selfless endeavor towards our  country, as per your inclination and time, the government has come up  with a Digital Platform."
"Through the medium of this platform, the  government has linked volunteers of social organizations,  representatives of civil society and local administration with each  other."
It did not take long for 1.25 crore people to be part of this  portal.
"They comprise Doctors, Nurses, ASHA-ANM workers, our friends  from NCC and NSS, professionals from myriad fields…all of them have made  the platform their own."
These people are of immense help at the local  level in preparing Crisis Management Plans and implementing them.
You  too can join covidwarriors.gov.in to be a Covid warrior and serve the  country.
"It paves the way for  further possibilities, shaping the course for newer goals."
The strength  of the resolve the countrymen have displayed during the crisis has led  to the beginning of a new transformation too in India.
"Our businesses,  offices, educational institutions, our medical sector are rapidly  advancing towards new operational changes."
"On the technology front, it  actually seems every innovator in the country is coming up anew with  something or the other amid emerging situations."
Friends we are  experiencing the results of the entire country in unison as a team.
"Today, the Central Government, State Governments; each and every  department and institution are working hand in hand for relief at full  speed."
"People working in the aviation sector, Railway employees are  working day and night to alleviate hurdles confronting our countrymen.."
Many of you might be aware of a special campaign called ‘Lifeline Udan’  undertaken for ensuring supply of medicines to every corner of the  country.
"Within a short span of time, our colleagues clocked a flight  distance of three lakh kilometers, delivering over five hundred tons of  medical supplies to you in the farthest corners of the country."
"Similarly our colleagues in the Railways are working relentlessly during  the lockdown, so that the common man throughout the country does not  have to face the shortage of essential commodities."
"Similarly, our postal department personnel are playing a critical role  in ensuring medical supplies."
All these colleagues of ours are Corona  Warriors in the truest sense.
"Friends,  money is being directly transferred into the accounts of the poor, as  part of the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Package."
Old age pension has  been started.
The poor are being provided facilities like free of cost  gas cylinders and rations for three months.
"In all these activities,  different government departments and banking sector personnel are  working together round the clock as a team."
And I would also like to  commend our state governments for playing a very proactive role in  dealing with this pandemic.
The responsibilities being borne by local  administrations and state governments are critical in the fight against  Corona.
Their hard work is worthy of commendation.
"My  dear countrymen, medical services personnel across the country have  expressed satisfaction with the ordinance that has been issued recently."
This ordinance provides for stringent punishment for those harassing or  injuring or indulging in violence against Corona warriors.
"My  dear countrymen, we feel that during the fight against this pandemic,  we have been accorded an opportunity to look at our lives, our society  and the happenings around us, with a fresh perspective."
There is a  far-reaching change in the viewpoint of the society.
Today we realise  the importance of each person who is connected with our lives.
"Whether  they are household helps, common workers who fulfill our various needs  or personnel working in shops nearby – we are realising what a major  role they play in our lives."
"Similarly, personnel delivering essential  services, labourers working in marketplaces, the auto rickshaw drivers  in our neighbourhood – today we realise how difficult our lives can be  without them."
"These days we regularly  see on the social media that during the lock down, people are not only  remembering these colleagues and helping them with their needs, but are  also writing about them with great respect."
Today we see pictures coming  in from all corners where sanitation workers are being showered with  petals.
"Earlier, you probably did not even notice their contribution."
"Doctors, cleaning staff and other such services personnel, and even our  police organisations are being seen in a new light by the common people."
"Earlier when we thought of the police, we were engulfed only by  negative thoughts."
Today our police personnel are ensuring that food and  medicines reach the poor and the needy.
"Friends,  we often hear three words - nature, perversion and culture ."
"If we talk of human nature, 'this  is mine', 'I am using this' – such a mindset is considered quite  natural."
Nobody seems to have any objection to this.
We can refer to  this as 'nature'.
"But that 'which  doesn't belong to me', 'which is not rightfully mine', and I forcibly  snatch it from another person and use, can be referred to as a kind of  perversion or degeneration."
"nature and perversion,  if a cultured mind rises above, in thought and action, then 'culture'  manifests itself."
"Friends,  in critical times, these qualities are put to the test."
"You  would have seen in the past few days, that India has taken some  decisions while keeping true to its culture and ethos – and upholding  our cultural heritage."
"During this crisis, the world - including rich  and prosperous nations - is facing a shortage of medicines."
"In these  times, even if India does not provide medicines to the world, no one  would have faulted us."
Every country would understand that obviously  India would priorities the lives of its own citizens.
We took a  decision in keeping with our culture.
"While we stepped up efforts to  fulfill India's needs, we also paid heed to the cry of help that came  from other parts of the world to save humanity."
"We undertook the task of  providing medical supplies to the needy across the world, and have  successfully completed this humanitarian task."
"Today when I speak to  heads of state of various countries on phone, they make sure to express  gratitude to the people of India."
"When they say, 'Thank you India, Thank  you people of India', we feel greater pride in our country."
"In the same  vein, people across the world are paying special attention to the  importance of India's Ayurveda and Yoga."
Just look at the social media…  how people everywhere are discussing India's Ayurveda and Yoga to boost  immunity.
I am sure you all are following the Corona-related protocol to  boost immunity suggested by the Ayush ministry.
"Warm water, decoction  and other guidelines issued by Ayush ministry, would be very helpful for  you if you include it in your daily routine."
"Friends,  it has been our misfortune that we always refuse to acknowledge our own  strengths and glorious traditions."
Possibly this is largely due to our hundreds of year long  phase of bondage.
"Due to this, often we fail to realise our own  strengths."
Our self confidence wavers.
"That's why instead of presenting  our traditional principles with evidence based research, we just ignore  them and consider them inferior."
"Just as the world has happily accepted Yoga,  the world will surely also accept our ages old Ayurvedic principles."
"Of  course, the youth will have to resolve to do this and explain these  principles to the world in a scientific language, so that they  understand it."
"Friends, I must say,  many positive changes are organically making their way into our work  culture, our lifestyle and our daily habits."
You all must have felt how  this crisis has made us more aware and heightened our consciousness on  various subjects.
"The effect that is most visible around us, is wearing a  mask and covering the face."
"In the changed paradigm due to Corona,  masks are becoming a part of our lives."
"And when I talk of masks, I am reminded of something."
So – buying fruits meant illness.
But times have changed and this paradigm too has  shifted.
Similarly we are going to see a change in attitude towards  masks as well.
"Mark my words, masks will now become a symbol of cultured  society."
"If you want to save yourself and others from disease, you will  have to wear a mask."
"Friends,  another awareness that has come about in our society is that people now  understand the damage that can be caused by spitting in public places."
It had been a part of our bad habits that we would spit just about  anywhere.
This presents a serious challenge both to cleanliness and to  health.
"Although if we look at it, we have always been aware of this  problem, but this problem just refused to get addressed by our society."
But it's time now to get rid of this problem once and for all.
"As they  say, 'better late than never'."
"So even though we have been late in  addressing it, but now we must eradicate the spitting habit."
"These  things will not only boost our basic hygiene levels, but also help in  preventing the spread of the Corona infection."
"My  dear countrymen, it is a happy coincidence that, today when I am  sharing my ‘Mann Ki Baat' with you, it also happens to be the holy  festival of Akshaya-Tritiya’."
"Friends, 'Kshay' in Hindi means  destruction but ‘Akshay’ means that which is indestructible or which  never ends or is forever."
"We all celebrate this festival every year in  our homes, but this year it bears a special significance for us."
"In the  present troubled times, this is a day that reminds us that our soul, our  life-force, is 'Akshay'."
"This day reminds us that no matter how many  difficulties block our path, no matter how many disasters are wreaked  upon us and no matter how many contagions have to be faced - the human  spirit of fighting and battling them are inexhaustible."
It is also  believed that this is the day when the Pandavas got the Akshaya-Patra  through the blessings of Lord Krishna and Lord Suryadev.
Akshaya  Patra was the mythical vessel which always remained replete with food!
"Our farmers are our Annadata or providers who work hard in adverse  conditions, for the country, for all of us, imbued with this spirit."
"It  is due to their hard work, that today the country has vast reserves of  food grains for all of us and for the poor."
"On this day of Akshaya  Tritiya, we should give a thought about the preservation of our  environment, forests, rivers and the entire ecosystem, which play an  important role in our lives."
If we want to remain bestowed with  ‘renewable’ resources then we must first ensure that our earth remains  ever abundant.
Did you know that this  festival of Akshaya-Tritiya also provides us an occasion to realize the  strength of charity - Power of giving!
Whatever we give away  wholeheartedly is what actually matters!
It is not important what and  how much we give.
"In this period of crisis, our small efforts can become  a huge support for many people around us."
"Friends, this is a very holy  day in Jain traditions as it happens to be an important day in the life  of the first Tirthankara Lord Rishabhdev."
The followers of Jainism  celebrate it as a festival and hence it is quite easy to understand why  on this day people like to initiate an auspicious project.
"Since today  is the day to initiate something anew, cannot we all take a resolve to  make our earth bountiful and imperishable through our efforts?"
"Friends,  today also marks the birth anniversary of Lord Basaveshwara."
It has been  my good fortune that I have had the opportunity to learn and connect  with reminiscences of Lord Basaveshwara and his messages repeatedly.
I  extend many felicitations to all the followers of Lord Basaveshwara in  our country and the world on his birth anniversary.
"Friends,  the holy month of Ramazan too has begun."
"The last time when Ramazan was  celebrated, no one had imagined that we would be facing such a huge  predicament this time around."
"But, now that this trouble has come to  plague the entire world, it gives us an opportunity to mark this Ramazan  as an icon of restraint, goodwill, sensitivity and service."
"This time,  we should pray more than ever before so that prior to the celebration of  Eid the world is rid of Corona and we celebrate Eid with enthusiasm and  gaiety like earlier times."
"I am confident that during these days of  Ramazan, by adhering to the guidelines of the local administration, we  will reinforce our fight against Corona."
"It is still very important to  follow the rules of physical distancing in the streets, in the markets  and in the mohallas or colonies."
"Today, I also express my gratitude to  all those community leaders who are making people aware about the two  yards distancing and not going out of the houses."
"In  fact, Corona has changed the manner of celebrating festivals all over  the world including India .It has changed the ways of their observance."
"Recently, we observed many festivals such as Bihu, Baisakhi, Puthandu,  Vishu and Odia New Year."
"We saw how people celebrated these festivals  staying indoors, with great simplicity while wishing well for society."
In ordinary circumstances they used to celebrate these festivals with  full zeal and enthusiasm with friends and families.
people used to come  out of the house and share joy.
"But this time, everyone observed  restraint, following the rules of lockdown."
We have seen that this time  our Christian brethren too celebrated Easter within the confines of  their homes.
It is imperative at present to fulfill this responsibility  of ours towards society and our nation.
Only then will we be able to  prevent the spread of corona… We will be able to defeat a pandemic like  Corona.
"My dear countrymen, in the  midst of this pandemic, as a member of your family, and all of you  happen to be my family members, it is also my responsibility to touch  upon certain points and offer some suggestions."
"To my countrymen, I urge  , let us not at all get caught in the trap of over-confidence, let us  not harbor a feeling that if corona has not yet reached our city, our  village, our street or our office, it is not going to reach now."
See!
Never make such a mistake!
The experience of the world is narrating a  lot to us!
"And, here in our country we are always reminded again and  again - 'Where caution has been lowered, the accident has happened!'"
"Remember, our ancestors have guided us very well in dealing with such  situations."
Our ancestors have said – Agni:
"Therefore, in over-enthusiasm, there should be no  negligence at the local level or elsewhere."
We will always have to  remain cautious.
"And, I will reiterate, “Maintain a distance of two  yards and keep yourself healthy!” or ""Do Gaz Doori, Bahut Hai Zaroori!""."
"Wishing all of you the best of health, I conclude my thoughts."
"I also  wish that when we meet during the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, may some  news of escape from the clutches of this pandemic and mankind emerging  out of this predicament greet us from all over the world! Many Many Thanks"
"My  dear countrymen, Namaskar."
"Today, I am expressing Mann ki Baat at a time  when Corona is testing our patience; it is testing the limits of all of  us at enduring misery."
Many of our near and dear ones have left us  untimely.
"After successfully confronting the first wave of Corona, the  country was full of enthusiasm, full of self-confidence, but this storm  has shaken the country."
"Friends, in the days gone by, to tide  over this crisis, I had long deliberations with experts from myriad  sectors."
"People from our Pharma industry, vaccine manufacturers, those  connected with oxygen production, experts from the medical field have  put forth their valuable suggestions to the government."
"This time, for  emerging victorious in this battle, we have to accord priority to expert  and scientific advice."
The Government of India is applying its entire  might to give a fillip to the endeavours of State Governments.
"The State  Governments too are trying their best to fulfill their  responsibilities.Friends, presently, the country’s doctors and  health workers are waging a colossal battle against Corona."
"Over the  past one year, they have undergone varied experiences."
"Joining us, at  the moment, is the well known Dr Shashank Joshi ji from Mumbai."
Dr  Shashank ji has immense grassroot level experience in the field of  treatment of Corona and allied research. He has also been the Dean of  the Indian College of Physicians.
I had liked the  clarity in your thoughts.
I felt all citizens of the country should  know about your thoughts.
"From what we used to hear, I present it before  you in the form of a question."
"Dr Shashank, all of you are deeply  involved at the moment in saving lives, day and night…first of all, I’d  like you to tell people about the Second Wave."
"There are 2 – 3  differences here. The first is to an extent, it has been observed in  youth and children too."
"And the symptoms…like the earlier  one…breathlessness, dry cough, fever…all these are there…along with it,  loss of smell and taste are also there."
And people are a bit scared.
There is absolutely no need of being scared.
80 to 90 percent people do  not show any of these symptoms. What they call Mutation – there’s no  need to be afraid of that.
"These mutations keep on happening…the way we  change our clothes, the virus keeps changing its colours…hence there is  nothing to fear and we shall overcome this wave too."
"Waves keep coming  and going, the virus keeps coming and going…these are the various  symptoms and we have to be alert medically."
"Covid has a 14 to 21 day’s  timetable, in which we should avail of the Doctor’s advice."
"In  Covid, the clinical treatment protocol has magnitude of three types –  light or mild Covid, medium or moderate Covid and intense, what is  called severe Covid."
"In the case of mild Covid, we do oxygen monitoring,  pulse monitoring and fever monitoring. If the fever rises, sometimes we  use medicines like paracetamol…and one should consult a Doctor.In the  case of moderate or severe Covid, it is extremely important to contact  the Doctor."
Correct and inexpensive medicines are available.
"Steroids  can save life…inhalers can be given, tablets can be given. And along  with that, oxygen has to be administered…there are many simple  treatments available. But often what is happening is – there is a new  experimental medicine called Remdesivir."
But one thing about this  medicine is that one has to stay 2 – 3 days lesser in the hospital and  it aids in clinical recovery.
And this medicine too works only when it  is taken in the first 9-10 days…and it is to be taken only for five  days.
The way people are running after Remdesivir…they should stop doing  that.
It is important for all people to understand this.
"If we do  PRANAYAM, our lungs will expand a bit. And there’s an injection  available for thinning blood…it is called Heparin."
"If these simple  medicines are given, 98% people recover."
"So, staying positive is very  important."
It is imperative that treatment protocol is as per the  Doctor’s advice.
"If you compare Europe, America, our  patients are recovering through our treatment protocols.PM – Dr  Shashank, many thanks to you."
The pieces of information that Dr Shashank  gave us are very important and useful for all of us.
You can  consult your family doctor or doctors in the neighbourhood on the phone.
"I am noticing that many of our doctors are taking upon themselves this  responsibility, on their own."
Many doctors are providing information to  people through social media.
They are counseling on phone and WhatsApp.
Many hospitals have websites where information is available…there you  can seek advice of doctors too.
This is commendable.Joining me  is Dr Naveed Nazeer Shah from Srinagar.
Dr Naveed is a professor at a  Government Medical College in Srinagar.
"Naveed ji has cured many a  Corona patient under his supervision. In this holy month of Ramzan, Dr  Naveed is performing his duty and has also taken out time to talk to us."
"Dr Naveed, during these difficult times, our listeners of Mann ki  Baat have raised the question of Panic Management."
"Dr Naveed – See, when  Corona began, the first hospital to be designated as Covid Hospital was  our City Hospital, which comes under a medical college."
"They used to feel  that perhaps, if a person contracts Covid, it would be taken as a Death  Sentence. And amidst that, the doctors and paramedical staff working at  our hospital also underwent that sense of fear…how will we face these  patients…aren’t we at a risk of contracting the infection!"
"But as time  passed, we too observed that if we wear protective gear fully, abide by  precautions colllectively; we too, including our staff can stay safe. As  time passed by, we kept on noticing that some patients or people who  were ill were asymptomatic, who displayed no symptoms of the infection."
"We saw that close to 90-95% of the patients are those who recover  without in-medication…thus, with the passage of time, the fear of corona  in the minds of people largely reduced."
Today what we refer to as the  Second Wave that has come in this time…there is no need to panic this  time around too.
"Modi ji- Dr. Naveed people have many questions  regarding the vaccine too, like how much protection we will get from the  vaccine, how assured we can feel after the vaccine?"
"Dr. Naveed-  From the time since the corona infection has surfaced before us, till  today, we don’t have any effective treatment available…we can fight this  disease with only two things -one is protective measures … and we have  already been saying that if we get some effective vaccine we can  overcome this disease. Our country presently has two vaccines available  Covaccine and Covishield which have been made here itself."
"Other  companies too who have done their trials have found that its efficacy is  more than 60%. And if we talk of Jammu Kashmir, till now, 15 to 16 lakh  people have taken the vaccine."
"Yes, quite a few misconceptions or myths  about this have come up on social media enumerating the side effects."
"Only things that are routinely associated with  every vaccine – someone getting fever, ache in the entire body or  getting pain locally where injection is applied- we have seen such side  effects in all patients ;we have not seen any gross adverse effect."
"And  yes , secondly,some people had the apprehension that after vaccination,  that is on getting the vaccine, some people got positive. In this,  companies themselves have given guidelines that if someone is  vaccinated, they may have infection, they can get positive."
"Modi ji- Dr Naveed many many thanks to you, and best wishes to you for the pious month of Ramazan."
"in this period of Corona crisis, all are getting aware of  the importance of vaccine … so it is my appeal that don’t get swayed by  any rumour about the vaccine."
You all must be knowing that people above  45 years of age can benefit from the free vaccine that has been sent to  all state governments by the government of India.
"Now the Corporate Sector, companies too  will be able to participate in the programme of administering vaccine to  their employees."
I also want to say that the programme of free vaccine  by the government of India that is going on now will continue further  too.
I appeal also to the states to extend the benefit of this free  vaccine campaign of government of India to maximum number of the people  of their state.
"Friends, we all know how difficult mentally it is to  take care of ourselves, our family during disease. But our nursing staff  in hospitals has to do this very job continuously, with so many  patients at the same time."
This sense of service is a great strength of  our society.
Only a nurse can tell properly about the service and hard  work of the nursing staff.
"That is why, in Mann Ki Baat, I have invited  sister Bhavana Dhruv ji who is providing her services at B R Ambedkar  Medical College in Raipur."
"The experience that you have  with Corona patients, people of the country would definitely like to  hear that because sisters, nurses are closest to the patient for the  longest duration, so they can understand every aspect in great  detail…please tell us."
We do our duties for 14 days and after that we are  given rest.
Then after 2 months our Covid duties are repeated sir.
"When I  was put on Covid duty for the first time, first of all I shared this  Covid duty part with my family members."
"And as I shared  this, all got scared, worried … they started telling me that I should  work with care…it was an emotional situation Sir."
To remove their fear we gave them a  very healthy environment.
"When we were told to do COVID duty, first of  all, we were asked to wear a PPE Kit, which is quite difficult… to do  duty with the PPE Kit on."
"Sir this was very tough for us …in 2 months  duty, I have worked everywhere …14- 14 days duty in wards, in ICU, in  Isolation."
"I  worked as a team member… whatever problem they had… I shared, I came to  know about the patients and removed their stigma, there were many people  who were frightened of even the name of Covid."
"They showed all  symptoms… when we used to take their history, but because of fear they  wouldn’t be able to get their test done, then we would counsel them …  and Sir when severity would increase, by then their lungs would have  already been infected…by the time they came they would need ICU by then  and with them their entire family would come."
So I have seen 1-2 such  cases sir and not just that …I have worked with all age groups.
"In that  were small kids, ladies, men, senior citizens… all kinds of patients  sir."
"When we talked to them they said that they did not come because of  fear, we got the same answer from all."
"Then we counselled them Sir, that  there is nothing to fear, just follow us … we will support you … follow  whatever protocol is there."
"We could do only this much for them.Modi  ji- Bhavana ji, I felt nice talking to you, you have given me quite  good information."
"You have shared by your experience, definitely this  will send a message of positivity to the countrymen."
This  is a big inspiration for all of us.
Pay special attention to your health  as well.
"Friends, Sister Surekha  ji is now connected with us from Bengaluru at this time."
Modi ji:- Thank you surekha ji.Surekha:- Thank you sir.
"Surekha  ji, indeed, you are holding fort in a very difficult time."
Take care of  yourself!
I wish the very best for your family.
"Positive Spirit is imperative to fight Corona and the  countrymen have to maintain the very same positive spirit.My  dear friends, along with Doctors and Nursing Staff, at the moment  frontline Workers like Lab-Technicians and Ambulance Drivers are also  working in a godlike manner !"
"When an Ambulance reaches a patient, the  family feels as if an angel has visited them in form of an Ambulance  Driver!"
The country must know about all the services rendered by them  & about their experiences!
"I have one such gentleman with me right  now - Mr. Prem Verma ji, who is an Ambulance Driver. As his name  denotes, Prem Verma ji does his work, his duty, with full love and  dedication."
Come!
Prem | Prem ji - yes sir.
Modi ji – About your work.
Prem ji - yes Modi ji – Do tell us in detail.
Also tell us about your experiences.Prem  ji - I am on the post of driver and as soon as Control gives us a call  on a tab… We respond to the call that comes from 102 and head towards  the patient.
We go to the patient and for the last two years we are  continuing this work.
"We wear our kit, wearing our gloves & mask,  reach the patient and wherever they ask us to drop, in whichever  hospital, we drop them as soon as possible."
Now my mom insists that I quit this job.
"I told her-  mother, if I too leave the job and sit idle, then who will carry these  patients?"
"Because everyone is deserting, leaving behind their jobs in  this period of corona!"
Everyone is leaving the job.
Mom tells me to  leave that job.
"I said no mom, I will not leave the job!Modi ji – Prem Ji do not hurt mother."
Modi ji - It is very touching.
Prem ji - Yes.
Modi ji - To your mother too.
"Friends,  Prem Verma ji and thousands of people like him today are serving the  people by putting their own lives at stake!"
Ambulance Drivers have also  contributed a lot to all the lives that have been saved in this fight  against Corona.
"Premji, I commend you and all your colleagues across the  country."
"keep reaching on time, keep saving lives!My dear  countrymen, it is true that many people are getting infected with  Corona. However, the number of people recovering from Corona is equally  high."
Preeti Chaturvedi of Gurugram has also recently defeated Corona.
Preeti ji is joining us in 'Mann Ki Baat'.
Her experiences will be of  immense benefit for all of us.
"Modi ji : Preeti ji, Namaste Preeti ji : Namaste Sir."
How are you doing?
Modi ji : I am fine .
"Preeti ji : No no Sir, it was just me Modi ji : God has been kind."
"Modi  ji : That you share some experiences of the state of your suffering …  then, perhaps those listening in right now may also get guidance on how  to handle themselves at such a time."
Preeti  ji : Sure Sir.
"In the initial stage, I got extremely lethargic and  after that there was a slight soreness of the throat."
I felt that these  were symptoms and so I got myself tested.
"On the second day, as soon as  the report came in and I was diagnosed positive, I quarantined myself."
I  isolated myself in a room and consulted with doctors.
I started the  prescribed medication .Modi ji : So your family was saved due to quick action on your part.
Everyone else was negative.
I  was the only positive.
"Prior to that, I had isolated myself inside a  room."
"After keeping all my necessities, I locked myself in the room."
"And  along with that, I again started medication with the doctor."
"Sir, along  with medication, I started yoga &Ayurvedic.Along with that I also  started taking kadha, decoction."
"In order to boost my immunity Sir, in  the day, whenever I used to take my food, I took healthy food, which was  a protein rich diet."
"I took a lot of fluid, I gargled , inhaled steam  and took hot water."
I incorporated all of this as part of my daily  routine.
"And Sir, I would like to say that these days, the most  important thing is … one shouldn’t get worried at all."
"One has to remain  mentally strong and for me, yoga and breathing exercise helped and I  felt better doing them."
Modi ji : Yes.
"Preeti ji : Sir, I have not stopped doing Yoga Modi ji : Ok Preeti ji : I am still taking decoction and to boost my immunity, I am eating good, healthy food."
Preeti ji : I used to earlier neglect my own self but now I pay a lot of attention to my own being.
Modi ji : Thank you Preeti ji Preeti ji : Thank you so much Sir.
Modi  ji : I think the information you shared will help a lot of people.
"May  you stay healthy; may your family members stay healthy, I wish you all  the best."
"My dear countrymen, today,  our personnel from the medical field, frontline workers are all  endeavouring 24x7 in service work."
"Similarly, other people of the  society also are not lagging behind at this time."
The country is once  again united and fighting against Corona.
"These days, I see that someone  is delivering medicines to families living in quarantine, someone is  sending vegetables, milk, fruits etc."
Someone is offering free ambulance  services to patients.
"Even in such challenging times, in different  corners of the country, voluntary organizations are coming forward and  trying to do whatever they can to help others."
"This time, new awareness  is also being seen in the villages."
"By strictly following the Covid  rules, people are protecting their village from the corona, proper  arrangements are also being made for those who are coming from outside."
"Many young people have also come forward in the cities, working together  with the local residents, in order to prevent the rise of Corona cases  in their area. Meaning, on the one hand, the country is working day and  night for hospitals, ventilators and medicines and on the other hand."
The countrymen are also fighting the challenge of Corona with a lot of  heart.
"This resolve gives us so much strength, so much confidence."
Whatever efforts are being made are of great service to the society.
They strengthen the power of society.
"My  dear countrymen, today we kept the entire conversation of 'Mann Ki  Baat' focused on the corona pandemic, because, today, our biggest  priority is to defeat this disease."
Today is also Bhagwan Mahavir  Jayanti.
"On this occasion, I convey my good wishes to all the  countrymen."
The messages of Bhagwan Mahavir inspire us towards  perseverance and self-restraint.
The holy month of Ramzan is also going  on.
There is also Buddha Purnima ahead.
There is also the 400th Prakash  Parv of Guru Tegh Bahadur ji.
A landmark day ahead is PochisheBoishak -  Tagore Jayanti.
All these inspire us to perform our duties.
"As a  citizen, the more we perform our duties with efficiency in our lives,  the faster we will move on the path of the future, free from crisis."
"With this wish, I once again urge all of you to get vaccinated and we  also have to take full care."
Never forget this mantra.
We will soon prevail  together over this calamity.
"With this belief, I thank you all very  much."
Namaskar!
"My  dear countrymen, Saadar Namaskar."
"When on the one hand, a sense of  festivity pervades the land, and on the other, news of violence comes  in, from one part of the country, it is only natural of be concerned."
"Ours is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the land of Sardar Patel  who gave up his all for the unity of the nation."
"For centuries, our  forefathers have imbibed community values, nonviolence, mutual respect –  these are inherent to us."
We have been hearing  from our childhood.
"In my address from the ramparts of the  Red Fort, I had said that violence in the name of faith will not be  tolerated, whether it is communal belief systems, whether it is  subscribing to political ideologies, whether it is allegiance to a  person or customs and traditions."
In the Constitution  given to us by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar there is every provision for  ensuring justice for each and every person.
I want to assure my  countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on  the path of violent suppression – whether it is a person or a group  –neither this country nor any government will tolerate it.
Each and  every person will have to abide by the law; the law will fix  accountability and the guilty will unquestionably be punished.
"My  dear countrymen,our country is a land of diversities – these  diversities are not limited to our cuisine, life style and attire."
We observe diversity in every walk of life.
"Even our festivals are  replete with diversity. Ours is a rich cultural heritage, spanning  thousands of years – when we look at our cultural traditions, social  customs, historical events, there would hardly be a day left in the year  which is not connected with a festival."
"You would have noticed, that  all our festivals follow the almanac of nature."
There is a direct  connect with nature.
Many of our festivals are linked straightaway with  farmers and fishermen.
"Speaking about festivals today, I would first like to wish you all michhamidukkadam."
The  Jain community celebrated the SamvatsariParva yesterday.
"In the month  of Bhadra, ParyushanParva is celebrated by the Jain Community."
The last  day of ParyushanParva is observed as Samvatsari.
This is indeed a  remarkable tradition.
"The festival of Samvatsari is symbolic of  forgiveness, non-violence and brotherhood."
"It is also known as the  KshamavaniParva, and on this day, people traditionally greet each other  with, ‘michhamidukkadam.’"
The one who forgives is valiant.
"And Mahatma  Gandhi always said, that forgiveness is the quality of great men."
"Shakespeare  in his play, “The Merchant of Venice”, while explaining the importance  of forgiveness, has written, “Mercy is twice blest, It blesseth him that  gives and him that takes,” meaning, the forgiver and the forgiven both  stand to receive divine blessing."
"My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi  is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country."
"When we  speak of Ganesh Chaturthi, it is but natural to talk about SarvajanikGaneshotsav,  that is, community celebrations of the Ganesh Festival."
"This tradition  was established by Bal Gangadhar Tilak 125 years ago, and it was 125  years ago that Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav  became a symbol of India’s struggle for freedom."
"And after  Independence, this festival has become a vehicle of raising social and  educational awareness."
"Ganesh Chaturthi is a ten-day festival. This  Mahaparva, mega-festival stands for unity, equality, integrity and  honesty."
My heartiest greetings to all of you on the occasion of  Ganeshotsav.
The festival  of Onam is being celebrated in Kerela.
"Of the numerous colourful  festivals of India, Onam is a prime festival of Kerela."
This festival is  known for its social and cultural significance.
This festival showcases  the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
"It gives the message of love and  harmony -  awakens new hopes and aspirations, and gives new  confidence to the people."
Our festivals are now becoming great  attractions for tourism.
"And I would like to mention to my countrymen,  that festivals like Navaratri in Gujarat, or Durga Utsav  in Bengal are tremendous tourist attractions. Other festivals of our  country too, provide an opportunity to attract foreign visitors."
We  should think about what more can be done in this direction.
"In this series of festivals, Eid-ul-Zuha will be celebrated in a few days from now."
Heartiest felicitations and best wishes to all countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-Zuha.
"Festivals  are of course symbols of faith and belief; in the New India, we should  transform them into symbols of cleanliness as well."
"In individual  households, festivals and cleanliness are linked together."
"In fact,  preparationsfor festivals always begin with cleaning."
"This is nothing  new for us, but it is important to convert it into a social character."
"Public cleanliness must be insisted upon not just in our homes but  in our villages, towns, cities, states and in our entire country –  Cleanliness has to be inextricably linked to our festivals."
"My  dear countrymen, definitions of being modern are perpetually changing."
"These days, a new measure to gauge a new dimension, a new parameter, has  come in to being. It determines what your upbringing has been, how  modern you are, how modern your thinking is. And that measure is your  level of environment consciousness."
"And as a result of  this I find that, the ecofriendly Ganpati, in this Ganesh Festival has turned into a huge campaign."
"Some are using vegetable colours, while some  are pasting bits and pieces of paper."
All sorts of experiments are being  carried out in every family.
"This is probably the first of its kind,  the most widespread experiment in environment consciousness."
"Media  houses too, are making a great effort in training people, inspiring them  and guiding them towards ecofriendly Ganesh  idols."
What a massive transformation this has been; a pleasant one at  that.
"And as I mentioned, our country is blessed with millions and  millions of the brightest of brains."
And it is nice to see all sorts of  new innovations.
"Someone told me about a gentleman who is an engineer  and who has collected and combined special varieties of clay, to give  training in making Ganesh idols. The Ganesh Visarjan or immersion is  done in a small bucket of water, where the idol dissolves within no  time."
The campaign for Cleanliness which  was initiated three years ago will be marking its third anniversary on  the 2nd  of October.
Toilets have  increased from 39% to almost 67% of the population?
More than two lakh  thirty thousand villages have declared themselves open defecation free.
Gujarat  saw devastating floods recently.
"Many people lost their lives. When the waters receded, there was so much filth everywhere."
"That is  when, in Dhanera in the Banaskantha District of Gujarat, volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind cleaned  twenty-two affected temples and two mosques in a phased manner."
They  came together and toiled collectively.
"The volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hindset  a fine, inspiring example of unity for cleanliness."
"If this committed  effort towards cleanliness become inherent to us, our country will  certainly take our nation to greater heights."
"My dear countrymen, I call upon you to begin a campaign, Swachchata Hi Sewa, Cleanliness is Service, at least fifteen-twenty days prior to Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October – on the lines of the age-old belief, Jal SevaYahiPrabhuSeva,  Service to Water is Service to God."
Let’s create an environment of  cleanliness in the entire country.
"Whenever and wherever possible, let’s  look for the opportunity."
But we must all come together.
"We could look  at this as preparations for Diwali, preparations for Navaratri, preparations for Durga Puja."
"Do Shramdan, Donate through labor."
Come  together on Sundaysand Holidays.
"Go to settlements in your  neighborhood, go to nearby villages, but do this in the form of a  movement."
"I urge all NGOs, schools, colleges, social, cultural and  political leaders, people in the government, collectors and sarpanches, to begin creating an environment of cleanliness at least fifteen days ahead of Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October so that it turns out to be the 2nd  October of Gandhi’s dreams."
"The Ministry of Drinking Water and  Sanitation has created a section on MyGov.in where after constructing a  toilet you can register your name and the name of the beneficiary  family, who you helped."
"My friends from the social media can run a few  creative campaigns and thus become a source of inspiration in the  virtual world, to see results in the real world."
"The Ministry of  Drinking Water and Sanitation has organized, the Swachch Sankalp se Swachcha Siddhi Pratiyogita, From  the resolve of Cleanliness to attaining Cleanliness Competition  comprising an essay competition, a short film making competition and a  painting competition."
You can write essays in various languages and  there is no age limit.
You can make a short film even with your mobile  phone.
You can film a two-three-minute movie that inspires cleanliness.
It can be in any language; it could be silent too.
"The best three  participants – three at the district level, three at the state level  will be given prizes."
"I invite one and all – Come, join the Cleanliness  Campaign in this manner as well."
"I would like to reiterate, let’s resolve to celebrate, 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti this year as Swachch Do Aktoobar, Clean 2nd October."
"And to this end beginning 15th September let us take the mantra, the message, Swachchata Hi Seva."
Take one or another step towards  cleanliness.
Make your effort to be a part of it.
You will see how the  Gandhi Jayanti of this 2nd  October shines.
"You can imagine the inner bliss of paying homage to our  revered Bapu, with fifteen days of this cleanliness campaign,  Swachchata Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October."
"My  dear countrymen, I want to specially express my indebtedness to you."
"I  want to thank you from the core of my heart, not because you have been  connected with Mann Ki Baat, for such a long time – I want to express my  gratitude and indebtedness as millions of people from across the  country come together with Mann ki Baat."
"The number of listeners are in  crores out of which lakhs of people write letters to me, send messages,  and get their messages recorded on phone, which is a huge treasure for  me."
This has become a great opportunity for me to understand the hearts  and minds of one and all.
"Much as you wait for Mann ki Baat, I await  your messages with greater eagerness."
"I always look forward with  anticipation, because I find so much to learn from all that you share."
It is an opportunity to test my endeavors on this touchstone.
"Even the  smallest of your suggestions help me in thinking anew on a wide variety  of subjects. I therefore express my heartfelt gratitude for your  contributions and also my indebtedness to you. My endeavor always is to  see for myself, hear, read and understand your thoughts."
All sorts of  things come to me.
Now take this phone call for example.
You will be  able to correlate with it.
"You too would feel that, you would’ve  committed the same mistake."
"Sometimes certain things become a part of  our habits, that we don’t even realize that we are doing something  wrong."
"“Pradhan Mantri ji,  I am Aparna from Pune."
I want to tell you about a friend of mine.
"She  always tries to help others, but one habit of hers amazes me."
I went for  shopping with her at a mall.
"She coolly spent two thousand rupees on a  sari, and four hundred and fifty rupees on a pizza. Whereas, she haggled  for a long time, over merely five rupees, with the auto driver, who  took us to the mall."
"On the way back, we stopped to buy vegetables, and  again she haggled with the vendors to save 4-5 rupees."
I feel very bad.
"We spend extravagantly in high places, without a single thought, but  when it comes to our hardworking brethren, we quarrel with them over  small amounts."
We don’t trust them.
"Please speak about this on Mann  kiBaat.” Now after  listening to this phone call, I am certain that you would have been  shocked and awakened and would probably have resolved not to repeat such  a mistake."
"Don’t you feel that whenever a vendor comes to your door to  sell something, on his rounds, when we come into contact with small  shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, auto rickshaw drivers - in fact any  person who earns through sheer hard work – we start bargaining with him,  haggling with him: “No not so much, make it two rupees less, five  rupees less!” "
"Not just this, when we go to a  showroom to buy a saree, we don’t bargain, but when it comes to someone  poor, we just cannot resist bargaining."
Madam I am  grateful to you for calling me with this touching message.
"I am certain  that my countrymen, if they are in the habit of behaving in this way  with the poor will now stop doing so."
"My dear young friends, the country celebrates National Sports Day on the 29th  of August."
"This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player,  hockey wizard, Major Dhyan Chand ji."
His contribution to hockey was  unparalleled.
I am reminding you of this because I want the younger  generation of our country to take part in sports.
The young  generation of our country should come forward in the world of sports –  and in today’s computer era I would like to alert you to the fact that  the playing field is far more important than the play station.
"Play FIFA  on the computer, but sometimes show your skills with the football out  in the field."
You must be playing cricket on the computer but the  pleasure of actually playing cricket in an open field under the sky is  something else.
"Now the times are such that children, when they come home, they either  start watching cartoons in a corner, or are glued to mobile games."
There was a time when the mother would demand to know when her son  would be back.
"Young  friends, the Sports Ministry is launching a Sports Talent Search Portal  to search for sporting talent and to groom them. Any talented child who  has an achievement in sports, can upload his biodata or video on this  portal."
The Ministry of Sports will impart training to selected emerging  players. The Ministry is launching the portal tomorrow.
"The good news  for our young friends is that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup is being  organized in India, from the 6th to the 28th of October. Twenty-four teams from all over the world will be making India their home."
"Come,  let’s welcome the young visitors from all across the world with the  festival of Sports, let’s enjoy the sport, and create a conducive  sporting atmosphere in the country."
"I speak about sports today, and just  last week, a heartwarming incident took place, which I would like to  share with my countrymen."
"I had the opportunity to meet some young  daughters, some of who, were born in the Himalayas, who had absolutely  no connection with the sea."
Six of these young daughters are in the  Navy.
"Their grit and zeal, is inspiring for all of us."
"These six young  women will embark on a voyage across the seas, in a small boat, INS  Tarini."
"The expedition has been named, NavikaSagar Parikrama."
"They will  circumnavigate the globe and return home, after many months."
"Sometimes  they will spend 40 days on the seas in one go; at times, thirty."
Each and every Indian would be proud  of these daughters.
I salute their valour and I have asked them to  share their experiences with the entire country.
I too am making a  separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App to  ensure that you can read it.
"For this is a tale of heroism, a tale of  personal experiences, and I would be happy to bring you the stories of  these daughters."
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
"My dear countrymen, we celebrate 5th  September as Teacher’s Day."
"It is the birthday of our former President,  Dr. Radhakrishnan ji."
"He was the President, but all through his life,  he saw himself as a teacher."
He preferred to live a teacher’s life.
He  was committed to being a teacher.
"He was a scholar, a diplomat, the  President of India and yet, quintessentially a teacher."
I salute him.
"The  great scientist Albert Einstein said, “It is the supreme art of the  teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.” The most  important quality of a teacher, is to awaken in his students, a sense of  creativity and the joy of learning."
As we celebrate Teacher’s Day this  year can we come together and take a resolve?
Can we run a campaign in  mission mode?
"Teach to Transform, Educate to Empower, Learn to Lead."
Can we move ahead with this resolve?
"Get someone committed  to a five-year resolve. Show him the path of attainment, which he can  achieve in five years - so that he can experience the joy of success in  life. Such an atmosphere can be created by our schools, our colleges,  our teachers, our educational institutions. When we speak about  transformation in our country, we must think of our teachers as we do of  our mothers."
The teacher plays a vital role in transformation.
"We will  play a big role in the transformation of the nation, if we make a  collective effort."
"Come, let’s move forward with the mantra, Teach to  Transform."
"“Pranam Pradhan  Mantri ji, I am Dr. Ananya Awasthi."
I am a resident of Mumbai and work  for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.
"As a  researcher, I have been specially interested in Financial Inclusion. With reference to the social schemes related to Financial Inclusion, my  question to you is: In the backdrop of the Jan DhanYojna launched in  2014, can you say that, do the statistics show thattoday, three years  later, India is financially more secure and stronger, and whether this  empowerment and benefits have percolated down to our women, farmers and  workers, in villages and small towns."
"Thank you.” My  dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, financial inclusion,  had been a point of discussion amongst Financial Pundits, not just in  India, but all over the world."
"On the 28th of August 2014, we had launched this campaign with a dream in our hearts."
"Tomorrow on the 28th  of August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna will complete three years."
"Thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme, bank accounts  have been opened."
"And today I feel a great sense of fulfilment,  that within three years, the last man on the fringes of society has  become a part of the mainstream economy of the country."
"When there is cash in the hand, or  in the pocket or at home, one is tempted to indulge in wasteful  expenditure."
There is now an air of prudence.
He is now beginning to  understand that the money can be of use for his children.
The money can  be used productively in the days to come.
"In a way, this is a  saving for the poor, this is his empowerment for the future."
"And those  who opened their accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, have  received the benefit of insurance as well."
"Schemes like, Pradhan Mantri  Jeewan Jyoti BimaYojna, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojna, with a small  premium of one rupee or thirty rupees, are giving a new sense of  confidence to the poor."
"For many families, in times of adversity, or on  the demise of the head of the family, through the  one-rupeeinsurance,they received two lakh rupees in a matter of days."
"Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna, Start Up Yojna, Stand Up Yojna – for Dalits,  Adivasis, women, educated youth, youth who want to stand on their own  feet - for millions and millions through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna,  they have been able to get loans from banks without any guarantee."
"My dear countrymen, Namaskar."
"Today, the entire country is celebrating Rakshabandhan."
Heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
The festival of Rakshabandhan symbolizes the bond of love & trust between a brother & a sister.
"For centuries, this festival has proved to be a shining example of social harmony."
"In the nation’s history, there are innumerable accounts of this sacred thread, binding together people of distant lands, different religions, around a spindle of trust."
"In a few days from now, we shall celebrate the festive occasion of Janmashtami."
"The whole atmosphere will reverberate to the sonorous chants & calls of ‘Hathi, Ghoda, Palki’, ‘Jai Kanhaiya Lal ki’ and ‘Govinda-Govinda’."
It is indeed an extremely joyous experience to imbue the essence of Bhagwan Krishna & revel blissfully.
"In other parts of the country, especially Maharashtra, our young friends must be busy with preparations of the ‘Dahi-Handi’…."
Heartiest greetings to all countrymen on the festive occasions of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
"Bhagini Chinmayee, भवती संस्कृत – प्रश्न पृष्टवत्ती |"
My salutations to you.
"On the occasion of Sanskrit week, I extend my best wishes to all countrymen."
I am extremely thankful to young Chinmayee for touching upon this subject.
"Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, Shravan Poornima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day."
"I congratulate all those actively involved in preserving & conserving this glorious heritage, helping it to reach out to the masses."
"Every language has its own significance, sanctity."
"India takes great pride in the fact that Tamil is the most ancient of world languages. We Indians also feel proud that from Vedic times to the modern day, Sanskrit language has played a stellar role in the universal spread of knowledge."
Sanskrit language & literature encompasses a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to every facet of life.
"Science & technology, agriculture & health, Mathematics & Management, economy & environment, the entire spectrum has been touched upon. It is said that our Vedas have detailed reference on Mantras, on ways & means to counter the challenges of global warming."
"You will be pleased to know that even today, residents of village Mattur in Shivamoga district of Karnataka use Sanskrit as their lingua franca."
"You will be astonished to know that Sanskrit is a language that possesses the capacity for infinite word formation with two thousand verb roots, 200 suffixes & 22 prefixes; coupled with compounds, the possibility of word-creation is limitless."
"We must abide by the same essence, the same spirit as we celebrate Teachers’ Day."
"On the occasion of Teachers’ Day, we remember the great philosopher, former President of India Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji."
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teacher’ Day across the country.
"I felicitate all the teachers in the country on this occasion. I also salute your sense of commitment towards science, education and students."
"My dear countrymen, the monsoon comes along, bringing a new ray of hope to our toiling farmers."
"It provided much needed succor to the scorched trees & shrubs, and to parched water bodies; on the other hand excessive rainfall causes devastating floods."
It’s a vagary of Nature that some places have received higher rainfall compared to other places.
We just saw how the terrible floods in Kerala have affected human lives.
"In today’s pressing, hard times, the entire Nation is with Kerala."
"Our sympathies are with those families who lost their loved ones. Loss of lives cannot be compensated, but I assure the grief-stricken families that in this moment of suffering & misery, a hundred & twenty five crore Indians stand by them, shoulder to shoulder."
I earnestly pray for those injured in this natural disaster to get well soon.
I firmly believe that the sheer grit and courage of the people of the state will see Kerala rise again.
"From Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is endeavoring to contribute in some way or the other so that wherever a disaster strikes, be it Kerala or any other part of India, human life returns to normalcy."
"Irrespective of age group or area of work, people are contributing."
"Everyone is trying to ensure speedy mitigation of the sufferings people in Kerala are going through, in fact sharing their pain."
We know that jawans of our armed forces are the vanguards of rescue & relief operations in Kerala.
They have left no stone unturned as saviors of those trapped in the floods.
"The Air Force, Navy, Army, BSF, CISF, RAF, every agency has played an exemplary role in the rescue & relief operations."
I would like to specially mention the arduous endeavors of the NDRF daredevils.
"At this moment of hardship & agony, their service stands out as a shining example."
"The capability, commitment & controlling situation through rapid decisions of the NDRF have made them a cynosure of every Indian’s eye, worthy of respect & admiration."
"We pray for Onam to provide strength to the country, especially Kerala so that it returns to normalcy on a newer journey of development."
"Once again on behalf of all Indians, I would like to re assure each & everyone in Kerala and other affected places that at this moment of calamity, the entire country stands by them."
My dear countrymen !
I was looking into the suggestions received for “Mann Ki Baat”. The subject about which most of the people from across the country have written is “Our revered Atal Behari Vajpayee”.
"Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar, Bihar and numerous others have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov asking me to speak on various aspects of Atalji’s life."
"As soon as the people in our country and abroad heard of the demise of Atalji on 16th August, everyone drowned in sadness."
He was a leader who gave up his position as Prime Minister fourteen years ago.
"In a way, he was cut-off from active politics for the last 10 years."
He was neither seen in the news nor in public life.
Ten years is a huge gap but on 16th August our country and the whole world witnessed that there was not a gap of even a single moment in the common man’s heart.
The wave of love and faith that spread across the nation is an indicator of his great personality.
"During these last days, many great aspects of Atalji came up to the fore."
"People remembered him as the best member of Parliament, sensitive writer, best orator and most popular Prime Minister and will continue to remember him."
"The country will ever remain grateful to Atalji for bringing good governance in the main stream. But, I just want to touch upon one more facet of Atalji’s legendary personality and that is the political culture which Atalji gave to India, his efforts in the direction of bringing about the changes in our political culture, his efforts to mould it into an organized framework and which proved very beneficial for India and a bigger benefit will accrue in days to come."
"India will remain ever grateful to Atalji for bringing the 91st Amendment Act, 2003."
This change brought about two important changes in India’s politics.
First one is that the size of the cabinet in states was restricted to 15% of the total seats in the state Assembly.
And the second one is that the limit under the Anti Defection Law was enhanced from one-thirds to two-thirds.
"Besides, clear guidelines were defined to disqualify the defector."
"For many years in India, the political culture of forming a very large cabinet was being misused to constitute jumbo cabinets not only to create a divide but also to appease political leaders."
This effort of his resulted in saving of money as well as of resources.
This also helped in improving efficiency.
"It could only be a visionary like Atalji who brought in this transformation and as a result of this, healthy traditions blossomed in our polity."
Atalji was a true patriot.
It was during his tenure that the timing of presenting the budget was changed.
"Earlier, as was the British tradition, the Budget used to be presented at 5 pm because in London, Parliament used to start working at that time."
"In the year 2001, Atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am."
One more freedom- the Indian Flag Code was framed in Atalji’s tenure and it came into effect in 2002.
A number of such rules have been included in this code which made it possible to unfurl the tricolor in public places.
This provided a chance to more and more of our countrymen to unfurl our national flag.
"Thus, he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the common man."
"You must have noticed how Atalji took bold steps to bring about fundamental reforms, whether in our election process or about the shortcomings concerning the people’s representatives."
"Similarly, you can see that presently efforts are afoot and discussions are being held about simultaneously holding the elections for Lok Sabha and for state assemblies."
The Government and the opposition – both are putting forth their view points.
This is a good development and a healthy sign for our democracy.
"I must say that developing healthy traditions for a sound democracy, making constant efforts to strengthen democracy, encouraging open-minded debates would also be a appropriate tribute to Atalji."
"Reiterating our resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I along with all of you pay tributes to Atalji."
"whenever a discussion about Parliament is there nowadays, it is about hold-ups, noisy scenes and stalling the proceedings but when something good happens, it is not given much importance."
The monsoon session of Parliament ended just a few days back.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha remained 118 percent and that of Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
All the members rose above party interests to make the Monsoon session most productive and this is why Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and in Rajya Sabha fourteen bills were passed.
This Monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session for social justice and youth welfare.
A number of important bills beneficial to the youth and the backward classes were passed during this session.
"As you know, a demand to constitute an OBC Commission similar to SC/ST commission was long pending for decades."
The country fulfilled its resolve this time to make an OBC Commission and also granted it Constitutional powers. This step will prove to be the one to move forward our march towards achieving the goal of social justice.
An amendment bill to secure the rights of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes also were passed in this session.
This Act will give more security to the interests of SC and ST communities.
This will also forbid criminals from indulging in atrocities and will instill confidence among the dalit communities.
No civil society can tolerate any kind of injustice towards the woman-power of the country.
With this point in view Parliament has made a provision of strictest punishment by passing the Criminal Act Amendment Bill.
Those guilty of rape will get a minimum sentence of ten years and those found guilty of raping girls below the age of 12 years will be awarded the death sentence.
"Recently, you might have read in newspapers, that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, after a brief hearing of two months, pronounced the death sentence on two criminals found guilty of raping a minor girl."
"Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh awarded the death sentence to the guilty after a hearing of just five days."
Courts in Rajasthan have also taken similar quick decisions.
This Act will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls.
Economic growth will be incomplete without a social transformation.
I assure the Muslim women that the whole country stands by them to provide them social justice.
"When we move ahead in the national interest, a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived ones can also be brought about."
"In the Monsoon session, this time, everyone jointly presented an ideal approach."
"Today, I publicly express my heartfelt gratitude to all MP’s."
My dear countrymen!
The attention of crores of Indians is focused on the Asian Games being held in Jakarta.
"Every morning, first of all, people look for newspapers, Television, News and Social Media to check Indian players winning medals."
The Asian Games are going on.
I wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country.
I extend my best wishes to those players who are yet to compete.
"Indian players are performing exceedingly well in shooting and wrestling but our players are winning medals in those competitions too, in which our performance has not been so good earlier-like WUSHU and ROWING. These are not just medals but an evidence of the sky high spirits of the Indian players."
This too is a very positive indication that most of the medal-winners hail from small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success by putting in sheer hard work.
We shall celebrate National Sports Day on 29th August and I extend my best wishes to all sport lovers and also pay my tributes to the legendary hockey wizard Shri Dhyanchandji.
I request every citizen to make it a point to play and take care of their fitness because only a healthy India will build a developed and prosperous India.
"When India will be fit, only then India’s future will be bright."
"Once again, I congratulate the medal winners at the Asian Games and also wish the remaining players perform well."
Many good wishes to you all on the National Sports Day.
"Namaste Bhawnaji, I respect your sentiments."
"All of us have seen houses and buildings being constructed of bricks and stones but can you imagine that about twelve hundred years ago, a giant mountain which was a single stone mountain was give the shape of an elegant, huge and a unique –temple –this may be difficult to imagine, but this happened and that temple is Kailash Nath Mandir in Ellora, Mahrashtra."
"Would you believe if someone tells you that about a thousand years ago, an over sixty metres tall pillar of granite was built and another granite rock weighing about 80 tonnes was placed over its top."
"But, Brihdeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unbelievable combination of Engineering and Architecture can be seen."
Anybody will feel overawed on seeing Rani Ki Vaav of the 11th Century in Patan in Gujarat.
Our land has been an engineering laboratory.
There have been several engineers in India who made the unimaginable possible and presented such marvels of engineering before the world.
Lakhs of farmers and common people continue to benefit from the Krishna Raj Sagar Dam built by him.
"In his memory, 15th September is observed as Engineers Day."
"When I talk of wonders in the Engineering world, I am reminded of an incident of 2001 when a devastating earth quake hit Kutch in Gujarat."
"I used to work as a volunteer there during those days, I got a chance to go to a village and had a chance to meet a lady of more than a hundred years of age."
"And she was looking at me and mockingly, saying, “Look at my house."
"But, you did not find any damage anywhere."
"While observing Engineers Day, we should think of the future as well."
Workshops should be held at different places.
What are the things we need to learn in the changing times?
What do we need to teach?
"Nowadays, disaster management has assumed immense significance."
The world is facing natural calamities.
What then should be the new form of structural engineering?
What courses should be designed to that end?
What should be taught to the students?
How do we keep construction eco friendly?
How can we enhance the quality of construction by making value addition through local materials?
How do we make zero waste our priority?
All such points need to be pondered upon when we observe Engineers Day.
There is a mood of festivity and with this the preparations for Diwali also begin.
"We will keep meeting through Mann Ki Baat, and will keep sharing matters close to our hearts. We will join hands in taking our country forward with heartfelt vigor."
"With these feelings, I extend my best wishes to you all."
Thanks.
We shall meet.
"On the one hand, these days, our country is  enjoying the feast of rains; on the other, every corner of the country  is celebrating festivals and fairs."
And this will go on till Diwali.
"Perhaps our ancestors intricately wove the annual seasonal cycle, the  economy cycle and social & life systems in a way that ensured, that  under no circumstances, dullness crept into society."
We celebrated quite  a few festivals in the days gone by.
"Yesterday, Krishna- Janma  Mahotsav, the festival of the birth of Lord Krishna was celebrated  throughout India."
"Can anyone even imagine the greatness of his  personality, that, even after thousands of years, the festival comes  along with renewed novelty, a new inspiration with fresh energy. And the  noble being that he was; although millennia ago, yet it is relevant in  providing solutions to problems as well as inspiration even today. Everyone can find solutions to present day problems from Shri Krishna’s  life."
"Despite the tremendous might  that he possessed, there were times when he would immerse himself in  performing the RAS; at other times he would be in the midst of cows and  cowherds; sometimes indulging in sports & games; often playing the  flute. A personality brimming with diverse talents and immense  capability, yet devoted to empowering society and people, a persona that  embodied pioneering accomplishments, a repository, a savior of people."
"And  that’s why today, as I converse with you, my attention is drawn towards  two Mohans."
One is the Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan and the other is  the Charkha bearing Mohan.
"The  Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan left the banks of the Yamuna for the sea  beach of Gujarat, establishing himself in the city of Dwarika, while the  Mohan born on the sea beach reached the banks of the Yamuna, breathing  his last in Delhi."
"Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan, thousands of years  ago, had amply used his wisdom, his sense of duty, his might, his  worldview to avert war, to prevent conflict, a sign of the times then. And spinning-wheel bearing Mohan too chose a similar path, for the sake  of Freedom, for preserving human values, for strengthening the basic  elements of personality & character- for this he lent a certain hue  to the Freedom struggle, a turn, that left the whole world awe struck,  which it still remains today."
"Not just in India, it is a part of the discourse in  the whole world."
"My dear countrymen, I’m referring to the 150th birth  anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi."
"On the 2nd of October, 1869, at the beach  of Porbandar, in Kirti Mandir as it is known today,… in that tiny  abode, not just a person; an era was born, that charted the course of  human history."
One attribute has always been part &  parcel of Mahatma Gandhi’s being – and that was his sense of service and  the sense of duty towards it.
"If you view his life in entirety, you  will note that he served communities in South Africa that were bearing  the brunt of apartheid."
He  presented shining examples through the medium of service in his own  life.
"He set examples of the sense of service for others to learn- not  through words, but through deeds."
Gandhiji shared an unbreakable bond  with truth; he shared a similar unique bond with the spirit of service.
"Whoever, needed him, and wherever, Gandhiji was present to serve."
"He  emphasized not only on the spirit of service, but also on the inner  happiness it led to."
Service as a  virtue is meaningful when it is performed with a sense of joy-‘Seva  Parmo Dharmah’.
"But simultaneously, deep inner joy, the essence of  ‘Swantah Sukhaayah’ is inbuilt in the spirit of service."
We can  understand this from Bapu’s life.
"Mahatma Gandhi, of course, became the  voice of innumerable Indians, in the larger backdrop of upholding human  values & human dignity; in a way, he had become the voice of the  world."
"For Mahatma Gandhi, the individual and society, human beings  & humanity was everything."
"Whether it was the Phoenix Farm or the  Tolstoy Farm in Africa, the Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he laid special  emphasis on community mobilization in his own distinct way."
I have been  extremely fortunate to have been blessed with the opportunity to visit a  number of significant places associated with revered Mahatma Gandhi and  pay my homage.
I can say that Gandhi emphasized on the spirit of  collectiveness through a sense of service.
Community service and  community mobilization are virtues which we have to imbibe into our real  lives.
"This would be the real way of  paying true tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, the Karyanjali, the offering of  deeds."
Opportunities like these come often & we get associated with  them.
But should Gandhi 150 just come & go; will it be acceptable  to us?
No dear countrymen.
"All of us should introspect, dwell upon it,  discuss it, bring it into collective discourse."
"Joining hands with more  people of the society, from all strata, from all age groups; people from  villages, cities, men, women, we should ask ourselves. As an  individual, what can I add to the effort?"
What value addition could be  there from my side?
And being collective acquires its own strength.
"In  all the programmes of Gandhi 150, let there be a sense of  collectiveness, let there be a spirit of service."
Why don’t we join  hands and let the entire neighbourhood move together?
"If there is a  football team, then the entire team. Of course we’ll play football, but  along with it, we’ll pick up a deed to perform in conformity with one of  Gandhi’s ideals of service."
There could be a Ladies’ club!
"Routine  tasks of a modern day Ladies’ club shall be taken up, but besides that,  let all members of the Ladies’ club come together & perform an  activity of service!"
We can do a lot.
"Collect old books, distribute them  amongst the poor, spread the glow of knowledge."
And I do believe that  perhaps 130 crore countrymen are endowed with 130 crore ideas &  there could be 130 crore endeavours.
"There is no limit- whatever that  comes to your mind- but only with a genuine wish, a noble intention,  within the realms of harmony, and with complete dedication."
"My dear countrymen, a  few months ago, I was in Dandi."
"In our Freedom struggle, the salt  satyagrah at Dandi was an important turning point."
There I’d inaugurated  a state of the art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I sincerely urge  you to visit at least one place associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the  days to come.
"It could be any site… such as Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram,  Champaran, the Ashram at Wardha or spots in Delhi related to Mahatma  Gandhi."
"In the times to come, many programmes, competitions  & exhibitions have been planned."
In this context I feel like sharing  with you something very interesting.
"There is a famous art show called  the Venice Biennale’, where people from the world over congregate."
"This  time, in the India Pavilion at the Venice Biennale’, a very interesting  exhibition based on memories of Gandhiji was organized."
Of special  interest were the Haripura Panels.
These  Art Panels have a beautiful past.
"Before the Haripura Session, in  1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal of Shantiniketan  Kala Bhavan, Nandlal Bose."
It was Gandhiji’s wish that the lifestyle of  the people of India be depicted through the medium of art and this  artwork may be exhibited during the session.
"This is the same Nandlal  Bose whose artwork adorns our Constitution; lends to the Constitution a  new, unique identity."
"The very commitment & reverence of Nandlal  Bose have made him, along with the Constitution, immortal."
"Nandlal Bose  toured villages around Haripura, concluding with a few works of art  canvas, depicting glimpses of life in rural India."
This invaluable  artwork was a high point of discourse at Venice.
"Once again, along with  greetings on Gandhiji’s 150th birth anniversary, I express my  expectations from every Indian, of one resolve or the other."
"One should  do something for the sake of the country, society or just for someone  else."
"This will be a good, true & genuine Karyanjali to Bapu, a  tribute through a good deed."
This time around it will commence on the 11th  of September.
"During this period, all of us will move out of home,  donating toil & sweat through ‘Shramdaan’, as a ‘Karyanjali’ to  Mahatma Gandhi."
"Home or the neighbourhood lane, street circles,  crossings, or drains, schools and colleges … we have to involve  ourselves in a Mega campaign of ensuring cleanliness at public places."
This campaign has enthused people from all strata of society.
"Many of my  merchant brothers & sisters have put up a placard at their  establishments, boldly mentioning that customers ought to carry shopping  bags with them."
"This will result in monetary savings, as well as one  would be able to contribute towards protection of the environment."
"This  year, on the 2nd of October, when we celebrate Bapu’s 150th birth  anniversary, we shall not only dedicate to him an India that is Open  Defecation Free, but also shall lay the foundation of a new revolution  against plastic, by people themselves, throughout the country."
"I appeal  to all strata of society, residents of every village, town & city,  take it as a prayer with folded hands; let us celebrate Gandhi Jayanti  this year as a mark of our plastic free Mother India."
Let us celebrate  2nd October as a special day.
"Let us celebrate Mahatma Gandhi’s birth  anniversary as a special ‘Shramdaan’ Festival, where everyone will  donate one’s own labour."
"I urge all municipalities, municipal  corporations, District Administration, Gram Panchayats, Government &  non Governmental bodies, organizations; in fact each & every  citizen to work towards ensuring adequate arrangement for collection  & storage of plastic waste."
I also appeal to the corporate sector to  come out with ways & means proactively for appropriate disposal of  all accumulated plastic.
It can be recycled; it can be transformed into  fuel.
This way we can accomplish our task of ensuring safe disposal of  plastic waste before this Diwali.
All that is needed is a resolve.
"And  for inspiration, there’s no need to look hither- tither; what can be a  greater inspiration than Gandhi?"
"My  dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit, epigrammatic verses are, in a  way, gems of wisdom."
We can derive from them whatever we need in life.
These days I’m not in regular touch with the form… earlier it was  frequent.
Today I want to touch upon a very important point from a  Sanskrit Subhashit.
"These lines were written centuries ago, but even  today, carry great relevance."
"There is an excellent Subhashit that  mentions – “ पृथिव्यां त्रीणि रत्नानि जलमन्नं सुभाषितम् |मूढैःपाषाणखण्डेषु रत्नसंज्ञा प्रदीयते” || That  is, water, grain and subhashit are the three gems found on earth."
Imprudent people call stones as gems.
"Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, more  so for women and the new-born, since these two categories are the  foundation of the future of our society."
"Under the ‘Poshan Abhiyaan’  campaign, nutrition made available with the help of modern scientific  methods is being converted into a mass movement all over the country."
People are fighting a battle against malnutrition in innovative and  interesting ways.
"Once, an  interesting fact was brought to my notice."
The ‘Mutthi Bhar Dhaanya’  initiative has turned into a big movement in Nashik.
"In this novel  scheme, during the harvest period, Anganwadi workers collect a handful  of rice grain from the people."
This grain is used to make piping hot  food for children and women.
"In this way, the person contributing the  handful of grain transmutes into a conscientious civil social worker."
"All of us have heard about the ‘Ann Praashan  Sanskar’, the first solid morsel ritual for toddlers in families all  across India."
"In 2010,  Gujarat embarked upon planning to provide kids complimentary food on  the occasion of 'Ann Praashan Sanskar' so that this initiative spreads  awareness among the masses."
This is a great initiative that can be  adopted anywhere.
"In many states, people run meal campaigns on certain  dates."
"If the family celebrates a birthday, certain auspicious day or  observe an in- memoriam day, then the family members with self-prepared  nutritious and delicious food, go to the Anganwadis and also to the  schools and these family members themselves serve the children and feed  them."
They not only share their happiness but in the process receive  happiness magnified manifold!
There is a wonderful confluence of a sense  of service and satisfaction.
"My  Friends, there are many little things that can be employed in our  country’s effective fight against malnutrition."
"Today, due to lack of  awareness, both poor and affluent families are affected by malnutrition."
The month of September will be celebrated as ‘Poshan Abhiyaan’ across  the country.
"You must get connected with it, get information about this  initiative, add some new facet to ‘Poshan Abhiyaan’ by contributing to  it."
"If you manage to save a few people from malnutrition, it would mean  that we can bring the country out of the circle of malnutrition."
"With this  one episode, I have not only formed a connect with the youth around the  world but I had never thought that I would find a certain place in  young hearts in this way."
I had never thought that the youth of our  country and the world pay attention to diverse things.
I had never  thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the  hearts of young people around the world.
And look what happens?
Just  last week I went to Bhutan.
"I have  seen that whenever I have had the opportunity to go as Prime Minister,  and of course credit also goes to International Yoga Day, the situation  now is that wherever I go in the world or interact with someone, people  invariably spend close to 5-7 minutes asking questions on yoga."
There  must hardly be a major world leader who has not discussed yoga with me  and this has been my experience all over the world.
But these days I’m  experiencing something new.
The  Discovery Channel plans to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in  their respective languages.
"Today, when there is a global churning of  thought on environment, Global Warming, and Climate Change, I do hope  that in such circumstances, this episode of Discovery Channel will help  greatly in familiarizing the world with the message from India, the  traditions of India and the empathy for nature in India's trail of  glorious traditions."
It is my firm belief that people want to know  the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean  environment in India.
"But there is another interesting thing, some  people ask me one thing albeit with some hesitation -Modi ji, you were  speaking in Hindi and Bear Grylls does not know Hindi, so how did you  carry on such a fast conversation between the two of you?"
Was this  episode edited later?
How many times did the shooting happen for this  episode and how it happened?
They ask with great curiosity.
"Now,  there is no secret in this."
"Many people have this question in their  minds, so I will unravel this secret."
"Well, in a way it is no secret at  all!"
The reality is that technology was used extensively in my  conversation with Bear Grylls.
Whenever I spoke immediately there was a  simultaneous translation into English or simultaneous interpretation and  Bear Grylls had a small cordless instrument in his ear.
So I used to  speak in Hindi but he heard it in English and because of that the  communication became very easy and this is an amazing aspect about  technology.
"After the broadcast of  this show, a large number of people have been discussing about Jim  Corbett National Park."
You must also visit sites associated with nature  and wild life and animals.
"As I have said before, and I emphasize, that  you must visit the north-east in your lifetime."
What a glorious  abundance of nature exists there.
You will be left wonderstruck!
Your  horizon will expand.
"On 15th August, I urged all of you from the  ramparts of the Red Fort to visit at least 15 places within a span of  the next 3 years, 15 places within India and for 100% tourism, visit  these 15 sites!"
Witness and observe.
Our country is full of  diversity and this wide range of diversity will also inculcate  variations within you as a teacher.
Your life will be enriched.
Your  thinking will expand.
"My  dear countrymen, the concern and care for the environment in India  seems natural."
Last month I had the privilege of releasing the tiger  census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers there are in India?
"The tiger population in India is 2967, two thousand nine hundred sixty  seven."
"A few years ago, we were with  great difficulty at a figure half of what we have at present."
"The Tiger  summit took place in 2010 at St. Petersburg, Russia."
"At this summit, a  resolution was taken expressing concern about the dwindling tiger  population in the world."
It was resolved to double the number of tigers  worldwide by 2022.
"But this is New India, where we accomplish goals in  the quickest time possible."
We doubled our tiger numbers in 2019 itself.
"Not only the tiger population in India was doubled, but the number of  protected areas and community reserves has also increased."
"At  the time I was releasing the data on tigers, I also remembered the  Asiatic lion of the Gir in Gujarat."
Their number was decreasing.
"We took  several innovative steps, one after the other in the Gir."
"In 2007, it  was decided to deploy female guards."
There were improvements in the  infrastructure to increase tourism.
"Whenever we talk about nature and  wildlife, we only talk about conservation."
"But, we now have to move  beyond conservation and think about compassion."
Our scriptures have  provided great guidance with respect to this subject.
"That  is, if there are no forests, tigers are forced to venture into the  human habitat and are killed, and if there are no tigers in the forest,  then man cuts the forest and destroys it, so in fact the tiger protects  the forest and not that the forest protects the tiger - our forefathers  explained this great truth in a befitting manner."
"Therefore, we need to  not only conserve our forests, flora and fauna, but also create an  environment wherein they can flourish properly."
"My  dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami  Vivekananda delivered on September 11, 1893."
"This young monk of India,  who shook the conscience of the human race of the entire world, imparted  onto this world a glorious identity of India."
"The enslaved India which  was gazed at by the world in a much distorted manner was forced to  change its way of looking at India due to the words of a great man like  Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893."
"Come, let us look anew at India  which Swami Vivekananda had seen and let us put in practice the  inherent strength of India realized by Swami Vivekananda."
"We possess  everything within us, let us proceed with confidence."
"My  dear countrymen, all of you will remember that the 29th of August is  celebrated as 'National Sports Day'."
"On this occasion, we are going to  launch the 'Fit India Movement' across the country."
"I  want to make you aware about fitness and for a fit India, we should  unite to set some goals for the country."
And 2nd October as a day has  been totally dedicated to riddance from plastic.
All of us with all our  might must try to get rid of plastics from our home and everywhere  outside our houses. And I know that all these campaigns will make a big  splash on social media.
"Come, let us proceed with a new zeal, new  resolve and renewed strength."
"My dear  countrymen, this is all that this episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has in  store for you today."
I will wait for your  say and your suggestions.
"Come, let us all march together to make the  India which was dreamt of by our freedom fighters and realize Gandhi's  dreams - 'Swantah: Sukhayah'."
"Let us proceed, enjoying our inner bliss,  expressing our spirit of service."
Namaskar
"My  dear countrymen, Namaskar."
All of us know that today is the birth  anniversary of Major Dhyanchand ji.
"And our country celebrates it as  National Sports Day, in commemoration."
"A thought struck me, that  perhaps, wherever Major Dhyanchand ji’s soul must be at the moment, it  must be feeling overjoyed."
"And four decades  later, almost after 41 years, the youth of India, her sons and  daughters, once again infused vitality in our hockey."
"And irrespective  of the number of medals won, no citizen of India enjoys victory until a  medal is won in hockey. And this time, in the Olympics, the medal that  was won for hockey came our way after four decades."
"You can  imagine…wherever Major Dhyanchand ji might be…his heart, his soul must  be overflowing with joy. And the entire life of Dhyanchand ji was  dedicated to Sports…and that is why today, when the youth of the  country, our sons and daughters are visibly drawn towards sports."
"Friends,  whenever the subject of Sports and Games is touched upon, the entire  young generation comes into view; naturally so."
"And when we cast a keen  glance at the young generation, we notice a sweeping change there."
The  mind of the youth has undergone a transformation.
"And today’s young  minds, shunning obsolete, age old methods and patterns, want to do  something new altogether; something different."
Today’s young mind does  not want to tread readymade beaten paths; it wants to carve out newer  paths.
It wants to step on unknown territory.
"New destinations, new  goals as well, new roads, new aspirations as well!"
"We see how, some time ago, when India  opened her Space Sector…within no time the young generation lapped up  the opportunity. And to avail of its benefits, college students and  young people working in Universities and the private sector  enthusiastically came forward."
"Similarly, wherever you see…go  to any family…however well to do, however educated the family might  be…if you speak to a young person in the family, she or he, moving away  from family traditions, express the wish to do a start up or join a  start up…excitedly willing to take a risk."
"Today, the startup culture is  expanding even to smaller cities and I am seeing it as an indication of  a bright future."
"Just a few days ago, toys in our country were being  discussed."
"Within no time, when this caught the attention of our youth,  they too resolutely decided to work towards positioning Indian toys in  the world with a distinct identity."
And they are trying out ever new  experiments.
The world is a huge market for toys…a market of 6 to 7 lakh  crores.
Today India’s share is miniscule.
"But, how to craft toys, what  diversity to be lent to toys, what technology to be used, how toys  should be, compatible with child psychology…these are points where the  youth of the country is applying minds to…wishing to contribute  something."
And what is that…have you ever  marked?
"Generally, what had crept into our fabric was acceptance of  mediocrity…”It happens”, “It’s okay – this will do”!"
But now I’m  noticing my country’s young minds focusing themselves on excellence.
"They want to do the best, using the best methods."
This too will emerge  as a major force for the nation.
"Friends,  this time, the Olympics have created a major impact."
The events at the  Olympics are over; the Paralympics are going on.
"Whatever our country  earned in this world of Sports may be little in comparison with the  world, but enough has happened to bolster our belief."
"Today, it is not  that the youth is just watching sports…the youth is also looking at  possibilities associated with Sports…observing the entire eco system  minutely…comprehending its potential, wishing to connect with it in some  way or the other."
She or he now wants to surpass conventional ways and  adopt new disciplines.
"And my dear countrymen, now that such a momentum  has been built up…Sports has begun to be discussed in every family."
No…not  at all.
Even you must be thinking on the similar lines.
"In the country  now, Sports and Games, sportsman spirit is not to stop."
"In family life,  in social life, in the life of the Nation, this momentum has to be  accorded permanence…infusing it with energy…replenishing it with  relentless new energy."
"At home or elsewhere, in villages or cities, our  playgrounds must be filled up. Let all play – let all bloom!"
It is only through collective  endeavour of all that India will attain glorious heights in Sports that  she rightfully deserves.
On the course charted by people such as Major  Dhyanchand ji we have to move forward…it’s our responsibility.
"After  years has the country witnessed a period where, in families, in society,  in States, in the Nation, all the people are single mindedly forging a  bond with Sports."
"My dear young  friends, taking advantage of this opportunity, we must garner expertise  in a variety of sports."
"In villages as well, sports competitions should  be held successively."
It is only through competition that a sport  evolves…progresses…giving rise to sportspersons as an outcome.
"Come, let  all us countrymen strive to further this momentum as much as we  can…contributing whatever we can…let us transform the mantra of ‘Sabka  Prayas’ into reality."
"My dear  countrymen, tomorrow also happens to be the grand festival of  Janmashtmi."
"This festival of Janmashtami, that is the festival of birth  of Bhagwan Shri Krishna."
"We are familiar with all the forms of Bhagwan,  from naughty Kanhaiya to the one taking Colossal form Krishna, from the  one well versed in scriptures to one skilled in weaponary."
"Be it art,  beauty, charm, where all isn’t Krishna there!"
But I am saying all this  because a few days before Jamashtami I had gone through an interesting  experience.
So I felt I should talk about this to you.
You must be aware  that on the 20th of this month the construction work related to Bhagwan  Somnath temple has been dedicated to the people.
"3-4 kilometers away  from Somnath temple is the Bhalka Teerth, this Bhalka Teerth is the  place where Bhagwan Shri Krishna spent his last moments on earth."
"In a  way his Leelas, divine acts in this world culminated there."
Many works  for the development of that entire region are being done by the Somnath  Trust.
I was thinking of Bhalaka Teerth and the works going on there  when I noticed a beautiful art-book.
Someone had left this book for me  outside my residence.
In this there were many forms and many magnificent  pictures of Bhagwan Shri Krishna.
Pictures were very attractive and  very meaningful.
My curiosity grew all the more when I started turning  the pages of the book.
"When I saw the book and all the pictures and the  message for me written there, I felt l should meet the one who had left  it for me."
I should meet the one who has left the book outside my home.
So my office contacted the person.
"Such was my curiosity on seeing the  art-book, on seeing the different forms of Bhagwan Shri Krishna that I  called the person to meet the very next day."
With this curiosity I met  Jaduarani Dasi ji.
"She is American, was born in America, brought up in  America, Jadurani Dasi ji is connected to ISKCON, connected to Harey  Krishna movement and one of her major specialities is that she is  skilled in Bhakti Arts."
"You know that just after two days, on the 1st of  September, we have the 125th birth anniversary of the founder of ISKCON  Shri Prabhupaad Swami ji."
Jadurani Dasi ji had come to India in this  very connection.
"The question before me was that one who was born in  America, who had been so far away from the Indian ethos; how could she  make such attractive pictures of Bhagwan Shir Krishna!"
"I had a long chat  with her, but I want you to listen to some parts of it."
"Hare Krishna!, Friends,  when the people of the world pay heed to Indian spiritual systems and  philosophy today, then we also have a responsibility to carry forward  these great traditions."
"That which has perished has to be left behind,  but that which is timeless has to be carried forward."
"Let us celebrate  our festivals, understand its scientific meaning, and the connotation  behind it."
"Not only this, there is an underlying message in every  festival; there is a Sanskar as well."
"We not only have to know it, live  it and pass it on as a legacy for generations to come."
I once again wish  all the countrymen a very Happy Janmashtami.
"My  dear countrymen, during this Corona period, the myriad aspects of  cleanliness that I should have touched upon; I feel, perhaps, that it  saw a decrease."
I also feel that we should not let the cleanliness  campaign diminish even at the slightest.
"The examples of how efforts by  everyone for nation building in turn lead to progress for all of us,  also inspire us and infuse us with a new energy to do something, impart  new confidence, give a meaning to our resolve."
"We know very well that  whenever the topic Swachh Bharat Abhiyan comes up, the name of Indore  also arises because Indore has created a special identity of its own in  relation to cleanliness and the people of Indore are also entitled to  felicitations."
Our Indore has remained at number one in 'Swachh Bharat  Ranking' for many years.
"Now the people of Indore do not want to sit  satisfied with this ranking of Swachh Bharat, they want to move forward,  want to do something new."
And now they have decided to maintain a  'Water Plus City' and are striving for it with all their might.
Water  Plus City' means a city where no sewage is dumped into any public water  source without treatment.
The citizens here themselves have come  forward and connected their drains with the sewer line.
A Cleanliness  campaign has also been started and due to this the polluted water  draining in the Saraswati and Kanh rivers has also reduced considerably  and an improvement is visible.
"Today, when our country is celebrating  the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence, we have to remember that we should  never let the resolve of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan diminish."
"The greater  the number of cities which are ‘Water Plus City' in our country,  cleanliness will increase further, our rivers will also become clean and  we will be fulfilling values associated with humane responsibility of  conserving water."
"Friends, before me  is an example that has come from Madhubani in Bihar."
Dr. Rajendra Prasad  Agricultural University in Madhubani and the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra  have jointly made a worthy effort.
Not only farmers are accruing  benefit from this scheme but it has also imparted renewed vigour to the  Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
"The name of this initiative of the university is -  ""Sukhet Model"" The purpose of the Sukhet model is to reduce pollution  in the villages."
"Under this model, dung and other household waste is  collected from the farmers of the village and in return the villagers  are given money for cooking gas cylinders."
The work of making  vermicompost from the disposed garbage collected from the village is  also ongoing.
"Therefore, there are four benefits of the Sukhet model  that are directly visible."
"One, the village is freed from pollution; the  second is that the village is freed from filth, the third is that the  money for the LPG cylinder goes to the villagers and the fourth is that  the farmers of the village get bio- fertilizer."
You must give it a  thought as to how such efforts can increase the power of our villages.
This is the basis of self-reliance.
I appeal that every panchayat of the  country should also think of doing something like this in their  respective villages.
"And friends, when we set out with a goal, it is  certain that we achieve the results."
Now look at our Kanjirangal  Panchayat of Sivaganga district in Tamil Nadu.
"See what this small  panchayat has done, here you will get to see another model of wealth  from the Waste."
Here the Gram Panchayat along with the local people has  started an indigenous project to generate electricity from waste in  their village.
The capacity of this village power plant is to dispose  of two tonnes of waste per day.
The electricity generated from this  power plant is utilized for streetlights and other needs of the village.
The money saved by the Panchayat through this scheme is being used for  other developmental works.
"Now tell me, a small panchayat in Sivaganga  district of Tamil Nadu inspires all of us countrymen to do something or  not?"
"They have achieved wonders, haven't they?"
"My  dear countrymen,'Mann Ki Baat' is no longer confined to the borders of  India."
There is a discussion on 'Mann Ki Baat' in different corners of  the world too.
"And there are people from our Indian community living  abroad, who keep providing me with much new information."
And I also like  to sometimes share with you the unique programs that are going on  abroad in 'Mann Ki Baat'.
"Even today I will introduce you to some such  people, but before that I want to play an audio for you."
This was Sanskrit being spoken  on the radio and the one speaking was RJ Ganga.
RJ Ganga is a member of a  group of Radio Jockeys in Gujarat.
"Her other companions are RJ Neelam,  RJ Guru and RJ Hetal."
"All of them together in Gujarat, in Kevadiya are  currently engaged in enhancing respect for the Sanskrit language."
"And  you also know that this is the same Kevadiya where the world's tallest  statue, the pride of our country, the Statue of Unity is located, that  is the very Kevadiya I am talking about."
And the radio jockeys are such  that they wear multiple hats simultaneously.
"They also serve as guides,  and also run the Community Radio Initiative, Radio Unity 90 FM."
"These  RJs talk to their listeners in Sanskrit language, providing them with  information in Sanskrit."
"Friends, in these parts, it is said about Sanskrit  अमृतम् संस्कृतम् मित्र, सरसम् सरलम् वचः | एकता मूलकम् राष्ट्रे, ज्ञान विज्ञान पोषकम् |  That is, our Sanskrit language is sweet and also simple."
"Through  its thoughts and medium of literary texts, Sanskrit helps nurture  knowledge and also national unity, strengthens it."
Sanskrit literature  comprises the divine philosophy of humanity and knowledge which can  captivate anyone’s attention.
"Recently, I got to know about many such  people who are engaged in the inspirational work of teaching Sanskrit in  foreign lands."
"One such person is Mr. Rutger Kortenhorst, a well-known  Sanskrit scholar and teacher in Ireland who teaches Sanskrit to the  children there."
Sanskrit language also plays an important role in the  strengthening of cultural relations between India and Ireland and  between India and Thailand here in the east.
"Dr. Chirapat Prapandavidya  and Dr. Kusuma Rakshamani, both of them are playing a very important  role in the promotion of Sanskrit language in Thailand."
They have also  carried out comparative studies in literature of Thai and Sanskrit  languages.
"Another such professor is Shriman Boris Zakharin, who teaches  Sanskrit at Moscow State University in Russia."
He has published many  research papers and books.
He has also translated many books from  Sanskrit to Russian.
"Likewise,Sydney Sanskrit School is one of  Australia's premier institutions, where Sanskrit language is taught to  the students."
"For children, these schools also organize programs like  Sanskrit Grammar Camp, Sanskrit Plays and Sanskrit Day."
"Friends,  the efforts which have been made in recent times have brought a new  awareness about Sanskrit.Now is the time to increase our efforts in this  direction."
"It is our collective duty to cherish our heritage, preserve  it, pass it on to the new generation and future generations also have a  right to it."
Now is the time to increase everyone's efforts for these  works as well.
"Friends, if you know of any such person engaged in this  kind of effort, if you have any such information, then please share the  information related to them on social media with the hashtag Celebrating  Sanskrit."
"My dear countrymen, in the next few days  'Vishwakarma Jayanti' will also be celebrated."
"Here, Bhagwan Vishwakarma  is considered as a symbol of the creative power behind the genesis of  the world."
"Whoever through their skill, builds an object..innovates...  whether it is sewing-embroidery, software or satellite, all this is a  manifestation of Bhagwan Vishwakarma."
"Even though skill is being  recognized in a new way in the world today, our sages and seers have  emphasized on skill and scale for thousands of years."
"They have  interlinked skill, talent, ability with faith, thereby making it a part  of the philosophy of our lives."
Our Vedas have also dedicated many  sookta to Bhagwan Vishwakarma.
"Whichever great creations are there,  whatever new and big works have been done, our scriptures ascribe them  to Bhagwan Vishwakarma."
It is in a way a symbol of the thought that  whatever development and innovation is happening in the world happens  only through skills.This is the very sentiment behind the birth  anniversary of Bhagwan Vishwakarma and his worship.
And this has been  quoted in our scriptures too :  ‘विश्वम कृत्-सन्म कर्म व्यापारो यस्य सः विश्वकर्मा’  
"In the view of our scriptures, all the skilled,  talented people around us engaged in the process of creation and  building are the legacy of Bhagwan Vishwakarma."
"Our lives without such  individuals would be unfathomable.Think about it, if there is some  problem with electricity in your house and you cannot find an  electrician, how will it be?"
You will have to face a big hurdle!
Our  life goes on because of many such skilled people.
"Look around yourself;  be it an ironsmith, a potter, a carpenter, an electrician, a house  painter, a sanitation worker, or someone who repairs mobile-laptops."
All  of them are known only because of their skill.
"In modern form, all of  them are also Vishwakarma."
"But friends, there is another aspect to it  and it also sometimes causes concern. The situation in our country where  culture, tradition, thinking, skill, manpower have been interlinked  with Bhagwan Vishwakarma and how it has changed. once upon a time,  Kaushalya, our innate skills had a huge impact on our family life,  social life and life of the natio."
"But during the long period of slavery  and subjugation, the feeling that gave such respect to skill gradually  faded into oblivion."
The thinking became such that skill based tasks  were considered inferior.
"And now see, today, the whole world is  emphasizing the most on skill."
The worship of Bhagwan Vishwakarma is  also not to be completed only with formalities.
"We have to respect the  talent, we have to work hard to be skilled."
We should be proud to be  skilled.
"When we do something new, innovate something, create something  that will benefit the society, make people's life easier, then our  Vishwakarma Puja will be meaningful."
There is no dearth of opportunities  for skilled people in the world today.
Skills are forging multiple  paths of progress.
"Come, this time let us take a pledge to follow the  message of Bhagwan Vishwakarma along with faith in his worship."
"The  spirit of our worship should be such that we understand the importance  of skill, and also give full respect to skilled people, no matter what  work they do."
This is the time of the  75th year of our Independence.
"This year we have to make new  resolutions every day, think new, and bolster our spirit to do something  new."
"When India completes one hundred years of Independence, then only  these resolutions of ours will be seen in the foundation of its  successes."
"So, we should not let this opportunity pass."
We have to  contribute our maximum in this.
"And in the midst of all these efforts,  we have one more thing to remember."
"दवाई भी, कड़ाई भी...vaccinate and  take precautions."
"More than 62 crore vaccine doses have been  administered in the country, but still we have to be careful, be  vigilant."
"And yes, as always, whenever you do something new, think new,  then definitely include me in that."
I will be waiting for your letter  and messages.
"With this wish, once again many felicitations to all of  you for the upcoming festivals."
Thank you very much.
Namaskar!
"My  dear countrymen, Namaskar."
This is the last edition of ‘Mann Ki Baat’  this year and it’s a coincidence that this day happens to be the last  day of the year of 2017.
You and I shared many thoughts and ideas the  entire year.
"Your steady stream of letters to ‘Mann Ki Baat’, your  comments, this exchange between minds always infuses new energy in me."
"A  few hours later, the year will change, but this sequence of our  conversation will go on, just the way it is."
"We will renew this exchange  of thoughts on newer topics in the year to come, we’ll share new  experiences."
Heartiest New Year greetings to all of you.
"Over the last  few days, the festival of Christmas was celebrated across the world with  gaiety and fervor."
People in India too celebrated Christmas with warmth  and cheer.
"The pious occasion of Christmas reminds us of the great  teachings of Jesus Christ who laid much emphasis on the spirit of  service, ‘Sewa bhaav’."
The essence of the spirit of service can be felt  in the Bible too.
"The Son of Man has come, not to be served But to serve’ And to give his life, as blessing To all humankind."
"Be it any religion, caste or creed, tradition or colour in this world;  the spirit of service is an invaluable hallmark of the highest human  values."
"In our country we refer to ‘NishKaam Karma’, selfless deeds,  meaning a service done without any expectations."
"It is mentioned in our  land ‘Sewa Parmo Dharmah’… service is the noblest way of life, ‘Jeev  Seva hi Shiv Seva’… Service to living beings is service to god."
"Gurudev  Ramkrishna Paramhans used to cite, ‘serve living beings as if  worshipping the almighty."
"Come, let us remember great men &  their ideals; let us be reminded of the essence of holy occasions; let  us infuse a new awakening, a new drive into our great value system."
"My  dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th ‘Prakash Parv’ of Guru  Gobind Singh ji."
"The illustrious life of Guru Gobind Singh ji, full of  instances of courage & sacrifice is a source of inspiration to all  of us."
"Guru Gobind Singh ji preached the virtues of sublime human values  and at the same time, practiced them in his own life in letter &  spirit."
"A guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, Guru Gobind  Singh ji, in all these roles, performed the great task of inspiring  people."
He fought against oppression & injustice.
His teachings to  people focused on breaking the cordons of caste and religion.
"In this  endeavour, he stood to lose a lot on his personal front."
But he never  let antagonism raise its ugly head in his path.
"In every moment of his  life, the message of love, sacrifice & peace was palpable. His  personality was filled to the brim with the greatest of virtues."
"I’m  fortunate that at the beginning of this year, I got an opportunity to  participate in the 350th birth anniversary celebration organized at  Patna Sahib."
"Come, let us all resolve to imbibe & abide by lessons  from his great teachings & exemplary life and mould our own life in  accordance with them."
"The 1st of  January, 2018, i.e. tomorrow, in my view, is a special day."
"You’ll be  surprised, since the New Year comes every year, the 1st of January  arrives every year! But, when I refer to it as special, I really mean it  as special."
"People born in the year 2000 or later; those born in the  21st century will gradually begin to become eligible voters from the 1st  of January, 2018."
"The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st  century, the ‘New India Voters’."
I congratulate our youth & urge  them to register themselves as voters.
The entire nation is eager to  welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
"As voters of this century,  you too must be feeling proud."
Your vote will prove to be the bedrock of  New India.
The power of the vote is the greatest strength of a  democracy.
The vote is the most effective tool in bringing about a  positive change in the lives of millions of people.
And it’s not just  about you acquiring the right to Vote.
What should be the dreams of 21st century India?
"You too can be the makers of 21st century  India and this opportunity comes into being, very specially, on the 1st  of January."
"And today, in this edition of Mann Ki Baat, I wish to speak  to our successful young men & women between 18 & 25, all  infused with energy and resolve."
"I  consider them ‘New India Youth’, ‘New India Youth’ stands for  aspirations, enthusiasm & energy."
I firmly believe that the dream of  our ‘New India’ will be realized through the skill & fortitude of  these energetic youth.
"When we talk  of new India then that new India will be free from the poison of  casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption; free from filth and  poverty."
In the New India everyone will have equal opportunity and  aspirations and wishes of everyone will be fulfilled.
"New India will be a  place where peace, unity and amity will be our guiding force."
My New  India Youth should come forward and deliberate on how this New India  would be formed.
One should decide one’s own path and also decide a way  for connecting along those attached to one and the Caravan should get  going.
You should move forward and thus should the country move ahead.
"Right now, while taking to you I got an idea whether we could organize a  mock parliament in every district of India?"
"Where the youth between 18  and 25 could sit together and brain storm about new India, find ways and  chalk our plans."
How could we realize our resolves before 2022?
How  could we build an India of the dreams of our freedom fighters?
Mahatma  Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
"My  young friends, the need of the hour is that we build up a mass movement  for making a magnificent- glorious 21st century India; a mass movement  of development, a mass movement to build a capable and strong India."
I  propose that a mock Parliament be organized around 15th August in Delhi  comprising one young person selected from each district who would  participate and deliberate on how a new India could be formed in the  next five years.
How can resolve be transformed into reality?
"Today, a  lot of new opportunities have been created for the youth."
"Our youth are  coming forward in areas like skill development, innovation and  entrepreneurship and are achieving success."
I wish that the New India  Youth get information and details of all these new opportunities and  plans at one place and a system be created so that every young person on  turning 18 should automatically get to know all this and benefit from  it.
"My dear countrymen, I had talked  about positivity during the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat."
"I am being  reminded of one Sanskrit Shloka- Utsaaho balwaanarya, Naastyutsaahaatparam balam | Sotsaahasya cha lokeshu na kinchidapi durlabham ||"
Nothing is impossible for a man having  positivity and zeal.
"In English too, it is said, ‘Pessimism leads to  weakness, optimism to power’."
"During the previous episode of Mann Ki  Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to share their positive moments  of 2017 and to welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere."
"I  am very glad that a large number of people gave positive responses on  social media platform, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App and shared their  experiences."
"Lakhs of tweets were posted on Positive India hashtag (#),  which reached out to more than nearly 150 crore people."
"In a way, a wave  of positivity which emanated from India spread all over the world."
All  tweets and responses received were really inspiring.
It was indeed a  delightful experience.
"Some countrymen shared those incidents of this  year which left a special impact on their minds, a very positive one at  that."
Some people even shared their personal achievements.
 My name is Meenu Bhatia.
"I reside in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-1, Phase- I,  Delhi."
My daughter wanted to do M.B.A.
I needed to take a bank loan  which I got very easily and my daughter was able to continue her  studies.
# My name is Jyoti Rajendra  Waade.
I am speaking from Bodal.
One rupee per month was being deducted  towards insurance premium which my husband had subscribed to.
He  died in an accident.
Only we know of the situation we faced at that  time.
Assistance from the government helped us a lot and I could gather  the strength to stand myself.
# My  name is Santosh Bewani
A national highway has been constructed in 2017  through our village Bhinnar.
"As a result of this, our roads have  improved a lot and business there will surely get a boost."
"#  My name is Deepanshu Ahuja, Mohalla Saadatganj, district  Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh."
Two actions taken by our Indian soldiers  deserve a special mention – one was the Surgical Strike carried out in  Pakistan which destroyed launching pads of  terrorists and the  second was the unique valour displayed by Indian soldiers in Doklam.
# My name  is Satish Bewani.
We had a problem of water scarcity in our area and we  used to depend on an army pipeline for the last forty years.
"Now an  Independent pipeline has been constructed. So, this is our achievement  in 2017."
There are a large number of  such persons who have brought in positive transformation in the lives of  many people through endeavour at their own level.
"In fact, this is the  New India which we are all collectively building."
"Let us enter into the  New Year with such little achievements, begin our New Year and take a  concrete steps in the journey from ‘Positive India’ to ‘Progressive  India’. When we all talk of positivity, I also feel like sharing one  experience."
"Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of Anjum  Bashir Khan Khattak who is a topper in Kashmir Administrative Service  Examination."
He actually extricated himself from the sting of terrorism  and hatred and topped in the Kashmir Administrative Examination.
You  will be surprised to know that terrorists had set his ancestral home on  fire in 1990.
Terrorism and violence  were so widespread there that his family had to leave their ancestral  land and flee from there.
"For a young child, such an atmosphere of  violence could easily create darkness and bitterness in the heart, but  Anjum did not let it be so."
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different  path for himself – a path of serving the people.
He overcame the adverse  situation and scripted his own success story.
"Today, he has become a  source of inspiration not only in Jammu & Kashmir but for the youth  of the whole country."
"Anjum has proved that however adverse the  circumstances be, the clouds of despair and disappointment can easily be  cleared by taking positive steps."
"Just  last week, I had a chance of meeting some daughters of Jammu &  Kashmir."
"I was amazed at the spirit that they had, the enthusiasm that  was there in their hearts and the dreams they nurtured."
"I was listening  to them on how they wanted to make progress in various facets of life  and, how their lives were filled with hope."
"I talked to them, there was  no sign of despair; there was only enthusiasm, optimism, energy, dreams  and a sense of resolve."
"Whatever little time I spent with these  daughters, I got inspired myself. These are the strength of our nation,  they are my youth, they are the future of my country."
"My  dear countrymen, whenever there is a reference to famous religious  places, not only of India but of the whole world, it is very natural to  mention about the Sabrimala temple of Kerala."
"Millions of devotees come  to this world famous temple, seeking blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami."
"It  is a huge challenge maintaining cleanliness around such a large  religious place where devotees in such huge number come. And especially,  since this place is situated in the midst of hills and forests."
"But,  Sabrimala temple in itself is an example to show how this challenge  could be converted into a sanskar, a habit and what a tremendous  strength public participation has!"
One police officer P. Vijayan  initiated a programme Punyam Poonkavanam and commenced a voluntary  campaign of creating awareness on cleanliness.
"And, he began a tradition  that the yatra of devotees will remain incomplete if they do not  contribute by performing some physical labour or the other in the  cleanliness programme."
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every  devotee considers doing physical labour in the cleanliness drive as a  part of the Lord’s worship.
"Every morning, there is a uniquely pleasant  scene of cleanliness here when all devotees join in the drive."
"However  big a celebrity be, or however rich one might be or however high an  official be – each one contributes as an ordinary devotee in this Punyan  Poonkavanam programme and becomes a part of this cleanliness drive."
There  are many such examples before us.
This cleanliness drive in Sabrimala  and the contribution of Punyan Poonkavanam in this are so immense that  each devotee contributes and participates in it.
"Here, a strong resolve of maintaining cleanliness also is as important as the strict discipline observed during worship."
"And, all of us took  a resolve that on the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we shall  make some contribution in the direction of making Clean India which he  had dreamt of."
Efforts in the direction of cleanliness are being widely  taken across the whole country.
A change can now be seen in the form of  public participation in rural and urban areas alike.
"Cleanliness Survey  2018, the largest in the world, will be conducted from the 4th of  January to 10th of March, 2018 to evaluate achievements in cleanliness  level of our urban areas."
This survey will cover a population of more  than 40 crores in more than four thousand cities.
Separate teams will go to cities for inspection.
They will  talk to the people there and gather their reactions.
They will analyse  the use of the Cleanliness App and also about bringing reforms and  improvements in various kinds of service centres.
It is not for the government alone to maintain cleanliness.
Every  citizen and people’s organizations have a big responsibility.
And I  appeal to every citizen to actively participate in the Cleanliness  Survey to be undertaken in the coming days.
"For waste-  collection the principle of reduce, reuse and re-cycle is very  effective."
"Now ranking of cities will be done on the basis of this  survey- if your city has a population of more than one lakh, ranking  will be done on the national level and if the population of your city is  less than one lakh than it will be ranked on regional level."
Achieving  the highest ranking must be your dream and you should put all out  efforts in this direction.
"And all  of you must have a dream – ‘Our city – our efforts’, ‘Our progress –  country’s progress’."
"My  dear countrymen, there are a few things which appear small but they  have a far reaching impact on our image as a society."
"Today, in this  episode of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you."
"It has  come to our notice that if a Muslim woman wants to go on Haj  Pilgrimage, she must have a ‘Mehram’ or a male guardian, otherwise she  cannot travel."
"When  I first heard about it, I wondered how it could be possible!"
Who would  have drafted such rules?
Why this discrimination?
"And when I went into  the depth of the matter I was surprised to find that - even after  seventy years of our independence, we were the ones who had imposed  these restrictions."
"For decades, injustice was being rendered to Muslim  women but there was no discussion on it."
Even in many Islamic countries  this practice does not exist.
But Muslim women in India did not have  this right.
And I'm glad that our government paid heed to this matter.
Our  Ministry of Minority Affairs issued corrective measures and we  ameliorated this restriction by phasing out a tradition that had been in  practice for the past seventy years.
"Today, Muslim women can perform  Haj without 'mahram' or male Guardian and I am happy to note that this  time about thirteen hundred Muslim women have applied to perform Haj  without 'mahram' and women from different parts of the country from  Kerala to North India, have expressed their wish to go for the Haj  pilgrimage."
I have suggested to the Ministry of Minority Affairs that  they should ensure that all women who have applied to travel alone be  allowed to perform Haj.
I not only reiterate this wholeheartedly but it is my  firm belief that the journey of India’s progress has been possible due  to women-power and on the basis of their talent and we will continue to  march onwards on this path of progress.
It should be our constant  endeavor that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities  just like men get so that they can proceed simultaneously on the path of  progress.
"My dear countrymen, 26th  January is a historic festival for all of us."
"But 26th January, 2018,  will especially be remembered through the ages."
The Republic Day will be  celebrated with leaders of all ten ASEAN countries coming to India as  Chief Guests.
"This time, not one but  Ten chief guests would grace the Republic Day."
This is unprecedented in  India's history.
The year 2017 has been special for both ASEAN and  India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years of formation in 2017 and in 2017 25  years of India's partnership with ASEAN were completed.
On 26th January  the arrival of great leaders of 10 nations of the world as a unit is a  matter of pride for all Indians.
"My  Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, by the way our country  is a country of festivals."
There is hardly a day which does not have a  festival ascribed to it.
All of us have just celebrated Christmas and  the New Year is on its way.
"May the New Year bring greater happiness,  glad tidings and prosperity for all of you."
"Let us move forward with all  renewed zeal, enthusiasm, fervor and new resolve."
The month of January  is the period of the northward movement of the Earth on the celestial  orbit around sun and in this month Makar-Sankranti is also celebrated.
This is a festival linked with nature.
"Though all of our festivals are  associated with nature in one way or the other, but in our country  blessed with the bounty of cultural diversity, there are different ways  to celebrate this wonderful episode of nature in different forms."
"Lohdi  is celebrated in Punjab and North-India, while UP-Bihar eagerly await  for Khichdi and Til-Sankranti."
"In Rajasthan, it is called Sankrant,  Magh-bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu - all these festivals are  special in their own right and they have their own importance."
All of  these festivals are usually celebrated between 13th and 17thJanuary.
"These  festivals may have different names, but their origins stems from  attachment to nature and agriculture."
Felicitations to all of you on the  occasion of these festivals.
"And once again, best wishes for the New  Year 2018 to all of you."
I Thank you my dear countrymen.
We shall converse again in 2018.
Thank you
"My  dear countrymen, Namaskar."
The moment to bid adieu to 2019 is round the  corner knocking at our doors!
"In a matter of just 3 days, not only  will 2019 wave good bye to us; we shall usher our selves  into a  new year and a new decade; the third decade of the 21st  century!"
I extend my heartiest greetings to all countrymen on the  arrival of year 2020.
"One thing is certain about the decade to come. And  that is, it will witness the active contribution of those who were born  in the 21st century, in the country’s progress; these are  people who are growing up, understanding the significant issues  pertaining to this century."
"The young people such as these, are known by  myriad terms."
"For some they are millennials; others call them  generation Z or Gen Zee too; and broadly speaking, one thing that has  captured the collective psyche is that this is the ‘Social Media  Generation’."
All of us experience that this generation is extremely  talented.
"It thrives on the dream to do something new, something  different."
"Not just that, they prefer to follow the system."
"And in the  event of the system not responding properly, they get restless and even  courageously question the system itself!"
I consider this attribute as a  virtue.
"One can even say with certitude here, that the country’s youth  detests anarchy of any sort."
"They despise any element of lack of  governance and instability; abhorring any shades of nepotism, casteism,  favouritism or gender discrimination."
"There are times when we see them  at an airport or a cinema theatre; if someone tries to break a queue,  the first to react vociferously are these young people."
And the culprit instantly realizes the consequence.
"Thus, our new  generation is an embodiment, a reflection of a new system, a new order, a  new age, a new thought."
"Today, India eagerly awaits this generation  expectantly."
These are the very people who have to elevate the country  to greater heights.
"Swami Vivekanand ji had observed, “My faith is in  the younger generation, the modern generation; out of them will come my  workers”."
"Referring to the youth, he had remarked, “The value of youth  can neither be ascertained, nor described!” Youth is the most valuable  phase, of one’s life."
Your life & future entirely depends on the way  your utilized your youth.
"According to Vivekanand ji, young people are  the one’s full of energy and dynamism, possessing the power to usher in  change."
"I am of the firm belief that for India, this decade will be, not  only about development & progress of the youth; it will also prove  to be about the country’s progress, harnessing their collective might. This generation will play a major role in modernizing India; I feel it  beyond any doubt."
"On the birth anniversary of Vivekanand on the 12th  of January, on the occasion of National Youth Day, every young person  should give a thought to this responsibility, taking on resolve or the  other for this decade."
That very rock Memorial is completing 50 years of  existence.
"For the last five decades, it has earned a place of pride for  India."
"Kanyakumari exudes a special attraction, nationally as well as  for the world."
"Swamiji’s Memorial has inspiringly instilled a sense of  national pride amongst people, irrespective of their sect, age or  class."
"It has shown the way to realize & follow the mantra, ‘In  service of the poorest of the poor’."
"When our Hon’ble President & Vice President are  visiting such important tourist destinations in India, it is bound to  inspire our countrymen."
"My dear countrymen, all of us  study  in myriad colleges, universities & schools."
"At times, such meets turn out to be  a special  attraction that gets noticed. And it is also important for it to catch  the attention of our countrymen."
""
"Actually, an alumni meet is an occasion  for old friends to come together, refresh memories; these are happy  moments indeed. Alongside, if this union comprises a shared purpose, a  resolve, an emotional connect, it lends additional hues to the event."
"You must have seen alumni groups at times, contributing something or the  other to their schools."
"Some arrange for systems for computerization,  some organize a better library, others go for revamping drinking water  facilities or new rooms. Some have gone to the extent of facilitating  sports complexes."
One thing or the other!
"But today, I  wish to present before you a special occasion. Just recently, I came  across on the media, a story on the Bhairavganj Health Centre in the  West Champaran district of Bihar. It was such a nice feeling that I  could not stop myself from sharing it with you."
"You may say, “So what?"
What is new in that?
"This was  not a government programme, nor was it a government initiative."
This was  a step taken as part of an Alumni Meet organized by former students of  the local K.R.
"‘Sankalp 95’  means, the resolve undertaken by the 1995 Batch of that High School."
"And after that, an entire movement centred on  public health got started."
"We often say that when every  citizen of the country takes a step ahead, our nation moves 130 crore  steps forward!"
"These  women have proved that if a resolution is taken with the true spirit of  solidarity, nothing can stop conditions changing for the better."
"With the help of ‘Gramin Ajivika Mission,’a slipper  manufacturing plant has also been established here, where slippers are  being made with the help of modern machines."
"Today once again I suggest, can we  promote locally made products?"
Can we prioritize them in our shopping?
Can we link local products with our status and pride?
"A hundred years ago, Gandhiji started  a huge public movement to promote Indian products as one of its  objectives."
This was the path shown by Gandhi ji towards self reliance.
Of some we know; others will always stay anonymous.
"They all  made sacrifices, firmly carrying that dream in their hearts….that of a  free India…for the sake of a prosperous, flourishing and free India."
"My  dear countrymen, can we pledge, that by 2022, when we achieve 75 years  of independence we insist and remain steadfast at least, for about  two-three years on buying local products?"
"Products made in India, made  by the hands of our citizens, carrying the fragrance of the sweat of our  countrymen, can’t we resolve to buy such things?"
"I do not advocate this  for a long time, just till 2022, till the completion of 75 years of  independence."
"And this work should not be carried out by government,  instead of this young people should step forward at various places, form  small organizations, motivate people, explain and decide –“Come, we  will buy only local, products, emphasize on local products, carrying the  fragrance of the sweat of our countrymen - That will be the exultant  moment of my free India; let these be the dreams with which we proceed!"
"My  dear countrymen, it is very important for all of us, that the citizens  of our country become self-reliant and live their lives with dignity."
I  would like to discuss one such initiative that has caught my attention  and that is the ‘Himayat Programme’of Jammu- Kashmir and Ladakh.
The  ‘Himayat Programme’ is actually associated with skill development and  employment.
"In this programme, teenagers and youth from 15 to 35 years  of age, those denizens of Jammu and Kashmir whose studies, for some  reason, could not be completed, who had to leave school and college  midstream are associated."
"My dear  countrymen, it would gladden you that under the aegis of this programme,  during the last two years, eighteen thousand youths, have been trained  in seventy seven different trades."
"Out of these, around five thousand  people are working somewhere or the other, and many have moved towards  self-employment."
"The success stories of lives which have changed under  the aegis of the ‘Himayat Programme’, truly touch the heart!"
"Until a year ago, she was living  in a small village in Kargil."
"At present, her life has undergone a  major change, she has become confident - she has become self-reliant and  has also brought an opportunity for prosperity for her entire family!"
"Similarly, the ‘Himayat  Programme’ came as a boon for Fiaz Ahmad of Doda district."
"Fiaz, battled a heart disease for two years."
"Meanwhile, one of his brothers and a sister also died."
"In a way, his  family was overwhelmed by trials and tribulations!"
"Eventually, he was  helped by the ‘Himayat Programme’."
He received training in ITES i.e. ‘Information Technology Enabled Services' uder the aegis of the ‘Himayat  Programme’ and today he is employed in Punjab.
"Recently, he was invited to share his experience at a ‘Himayat  Programme’ ."
"One day, Rakib came to know about  the ‘Himayat Programme’ through a mobilisation camp in his block."
Rakib  immediately enrolled himself in the Retail Team Leader course.
After  completing his training today he is working in a corporate house.
"There  are many examples of talented youth who have become symbols of change in  Jammu and Kashmir, benefiting from 'Himayat Mission'."
"The  ‘HimayatProgramme’is a perfect example of a great synergy between the  government, training partners, job providing companies and the people of  Jammu and Kashmir."
"This program has given a new found confidence to the youth in Jammu and Kashmir, and shown them a way to forge ahead."
"My dear countrymen, on the 26th  of this month, we witnessed the last solar eclipse of this decade."
"Possibly, this solar eclipse prompted Ripun to write a very interesting  comment on the MyGov portal."
I  would like to share something with you.
"I remember that due to the clear  skies in our region,  we used to gaze at the stars in the sky for  hours together."
I used to enjoy star-gazing.
"Now I am a professional,  and because of my daily routine, I am unable to find time for such  activities...can you discuss this topic in your show."
"Particularly, on  how to popularise  astronomy among the youth."
"My  dear countrymen, I receive a lot of suggestions, but it would be safe  to say that this suggestion is unique."
I have often spoken about many  aspects of science.
Especially the insistence of the youth has given me  an opportunity to talk about science.
"But this topic has never been  broached, and since the solar eclipse occurred on the 26th of  this month, possibly you might also be interested in this topic."
"Like  my countrymen, especially the youth among them, I too was eager to watch  the solar eclipse on the 26th of December. But  unfortunately, on that day overcast skies in Delhi prevented me from  enjoying the sight. Though, I did get to see beautiful pictures of the  solar eclipse that was visible in Kozhikode and some other parts of  India."
The sun was visible in the form of a shining ring.
"On that day, I  had the opportunity to talk to some experts in this field...and they  told me, that this is caused due to the fact that the moon is located  far away from the earth and hence, it is unable to completely cover the  sun."
"Hence, a ring-like shape is formed."
"This solar eclipse is an  annular solar eclipse, also referred to as 'Valay Grahan' or 'Kundal  Grahan'."
The eclipse reminds us that that we are travelling in space  while residing on the earth.
"Sun, moon and other planets and celestial  bodies are orbiting in space."
"Due to the shadow of the moon, we get to  see the various forms of solar eclipse."
"Friends, India has an ancient  and glorious history of astronomy."
Our connection with the twinkling  stars in the sky is as old as our civilisation.
"Many of you might be  aware that at various places in India, there are magnificent  observatories (Jantar Mantars) – which are worth seeing."
And these  observatories have a deep bond with astronomy.
Who doesn't know about  the prodigious talent of the great Aryabhatta.
"During  his career, he has expounded in great detail about the solar eclipse,  as well as the lunar eclipse."
And he has explained it both from a  philosophical as well as a mathematical standpoint.
"Mathematically, he  has described how to calculate the size of the shadow of the earth."
He  has also provided accurate information on how to calculate the duration  and extent of the eclipse.
"His disciples like Bhaskara, strived hard to  further this spirit of inquiry and knowledge."
"Later, in the fourteenth  or fifteenth century, Maadhav of Sangam village in Kerala, used calculus  to calculate the position of planets in the universe."
"The night sky,  was not merely something that whetted the curiosity."
It was an important  source for mathematicians and scientists.
"A few years ago, I had  unveiled a book called “Pre-modern Kutchi Navigation Techniques and  Voyages'."
"This book, in a way, is the diary of Maalam."
"Maalam was a  navigator and whatever he experienced professionally, he recorded it in  his diary."
"It describes  ancient navigation technology, and  that 'Maalam's volume'   repeatedly references, the sky, the stars, the speed of the stars, and  clearly describes how the direction is determined in sea voyages with  the help of stars; it is stars that navigate us towards our destination."
"My  dear countrymen, India is quite advanced in the field of astronomy, and  we have taken path-breaking initiatives in this field."
We have a giant  meter-wave telescope near Pune.
"Not just that, in Kodaikkaanal,  Udagamandala, Guru Shikhar and Hanle Ladakh as well, powerful telescopes  are located."
"In 2016, the then prime minister of Belgium and I, had  inaugurated the 3.6 metre Devasthal optical telescope in Nainital."
ISRO has an astronomical satellite  called ASTROSAT.
"ISRO is planning to launch a satellite called Aditya,  to study the sun."
"Whether it be our ancient knowledge in astronomy, or  modern achievements in this field, we should strive to understand them  and feel proud of them."
"Today, our young scientists not only display a  great desire to know their scientific history, but also are resolute in  fashioning astronomy's future."
"The  planetariums in our country, in addition to increasing the understanding  of the night sky, also motivate people to develop star gazing as a  hobby."
Many people install amateur telescopes on their balconies or  terrace.
Star gazing can also encourage rural camps and rural picnics.
"And there are many such schools and colleges that form astronomy clubs, and such steps must be encouraged."
"My  dear countrymen, we consider our Parliament as the temple of our  democracy."
"Today, I wish to proudly mention, that the parliamentarians  that you have elected have broken all the records of the last 60 years."
"In the last 6 months, both the sessions of the 17th Lok Sabha  have been very productive."
"Lok sabha's productivity stands at 114%,  while that of Rajya Sabha is 94%."
"And prior to that in the budget  session, it had a productivity of 135%."
"Often, Parliament functioned  till late at night."
I am mentioning this because all Parliamentarians  deserve to be congratulated and complimented for this.
"The  Parliamentarians that you elected, have broken all the records of the  last 60 years."
"So much accomplishment, in itself shows the strength of  Indian democracy and the faith in democracy."
"I wish to congratulate all  the Presiding officers, all political parties and all members of  parliament for their active role in this regard."
"My  dear countrymen, the movement of the sun, moon and earth doesn't just  determine eclipses, rather many other things are also associated with  them."
"We all know, that based on the sun's motion,  various  festivals will be celebrated throughout India in the middle of January."
From Punjab to Tamil Nadu...from Gujarat to Assam...people will  celebrate various festivals.
Makar Sankraanti and UttaraayaN is  celebrated with great fervour in the month of January.
They are  considered a symbol of energy.
"During this time, we will see the  celebration of Lohri in Punjab, Pongal in Tamil Nadu and Maagh Biihu in  Assam."
These festivals have a close link with the prosperity of farmers  and their crops.
These festivals remind us of India's unity as well as  its diversity.
The countrymen have the proud privilege to celebrate the  last day of Pongal as the birth anniversary of the great Tiruvalluvar .
This day is dedicated to the great writer-philosopher-saint Tiruvalluvar  and his life.
"My dear countrymen,  this is the final episode of “Man ki Baat” in 2019."
We will meet again  in 2020.
"New Year, new decade, new resolutions, new energy, new  enthusiasm, new zeal – come let's move forth."
Let's enable ourselves to  fulfill our resolutions.
"We have to walk far, we have to achieve a lot,  we have to take our country to new heights."
"Let's show immense faith in  the pursuits (actions), the abilities and the resolve of 130 crore  countrymen, and come – let's move forth."
"Many many thanks, many many  good wishes ."
Today is the 27th of December.
"Just four days  later, 2021 is about to usher in."
"In a way, today’s Mann Ki Baat is the  concluding Mann Ki Baat of 2020."
The next Mann Ki Baat will commence in  2021.
"Friends, numerous letters written by you are there in front of  me."
The suggestions you sent on Mygov too are there.
Many have expressed  themselves over the phone.
Most of the messages comprise experiences of  the year gone by and resolutions for 2021.
"Anjali from Kolhapur has  written that on new year, we offer greetings and good wishes to others  …let us do something novel this time!"
Why don’t we greet our country;  send best wishes to the country too!
May our country touch newer heights  in 2021… May India’s image in the world strengthen further…what could  be a greater wish than this!
"Friends,  Abhishek from Mumbai has posted a message on NAMO App."
"He has written  that whatever 2020 revealed to us, taught us was unthinkable."
He has  written on myriad aspects of CORONA.
"In these letters, in these  messages, one common special factor that comes across to me is something  that I would like to share with you."
In most of the letters people have  commended the country’s capabilities and the collective strength of the  countrymen.
"When a novel experiment such as Janta curfew became an  inspiration for the whole world, when the country felicitated our corona  warriors unitedly with Taali-thaali, the applause and the reverberating  chime of plates…..people have sent in reminiscences of that too."
"Friends,  the most common amongst the common folk of the country has felt this  transformation."
I have witnessed an extraordinary ripple of hope in the  country.
There came multiple challenges … many a crisis.
"On account of  Corona, the world faced numerous hurdles in terms of supply chains…But  we learnt a new lesson with every crisis."
The country was blessed with  newer capabilities.
"Putting it into words…this capacity is termed as  “Atmanirbharta”- self reliance.Friends, the experience that Abhinav  Banerjee from Delhi has written to me is very interesting too."
Abhinav  ji wanted to buy some toys and gifts for children in the family….hence  he had gone to Jhandewalan market in Delhi.
Many  of you might be aware that this market in Delhi is known for bicycles  and toys.
Earlier even expensive toys there would mean imported ones;  cheaper toys too would come in from elsewhere too.
"But Abhinav ji has  mentioned in his letter that many shopkeepers are selling toys to  customers emphasizing on the quality, saying those are better toys since  they are Made In India."
Customers too are demanding India made toys.
"Indeed, this is it- a big transformation in the mindset… this is living  proof of the same."
A huge change has begun in the minds of our  countrymen…that too within a year.
It is not easy to gauge this change.
Even economists would not be able to assess it on their parameters.
"Friends,  what Venkat Murli Prasad from Vishakhapatnam has written to me also  contains an idea of an entirely different kind."
Venkat ji has written  that he is attaching for me his ABC for 2021.
I could not understand  what he meant by ABC.
Then I saw that Venkat ji had attached a chart  along with the letter.
I glanced at the chart and realised what he meant  by ABC…Atmanirbhar Bharat Chart.
This is very interesting.
Venkat ji  has prepared a list of all those items that he uses on a daily basis.
"It  comprises electronics, stationery, self care items besides many other  things."
"Venkat ji has said that knowingly or unknowingly, we are using  those foreign products whose substitutes are easily available in India."
He has now vowed that he would use only that product that bears the mark  of our countrymen’s toil and sweat.
"Friends,  but along with that he has also referred to something which I found  pretty interesting."
"He has written that while we are supporting a self  reliant India, there should be a clear message for our manufacturers  that they should not compromise on the quality of the products."
What he  says is right.
"This is the opportune moment to work with the ethos of  ‘zero effect, zero defect’."
I urge manufacturers and industry leaders of  the country.
Whatever is global best; we should make it in  India and prove it.
"For that, our entrepreneur friends have to come  forward."
Startups too have to come forth.
"Once again, I congratulate  Venkat ji on his stellar effort."
"Friends,  we have to cherish this sentiment…preserve it and keep nurturing it as  well."
I have said this earlier too…I once again urge countrymen…do  prepare a list.
"Whatever items we use throughout the day ….analyse them  ….think of things manufactured abroad that have permeated into our lives  unknowingly, in a way, shackling us down."
Let us find out their  substitutes made in India and decide that henceforth we shall use  products made with the hard work and sweat of the people of India.
You  make New Year resolutions every year…this time one has to certainly make  a resolution for the sake of the country.
"My  dear countrymen, in order to protect our millennia old culture,  civilization and traditions from the cruel misdemeanors of tyrants &  tormentors many a supreme sacrifice was made…….It is a day to remember  them too."
The tyrants wanted sahibzade  to renounce their faith; abandon the teachings of the great Guru  tradition.
"But, our sahibzade showed amazing courage and determination  even at that tender age."
"During the immurement, as stones began piling  up, gradually raising the height of the wall……."
"death staring into the  face…..despite that, they did not budge even a bit."
It was on this day  itself that Guru Gobind Singh ji’s mother -Mata Gujari attained  martyrdom.
"About a week ago, it was the Martyrdom Day of Shri Guru Tegh  Bahadur ji too."
"Here in Delhi, I was blessed with the opportunity to  visit Gurudwara Rakabganj to offer floral tributes and pay my obeisance  to Guru Tegh Bahadur ji."
"During this very month, inspired by Shri Guru  Gobind Singh ji, many people sleep on the floor."
People reminisce the  supreme sacrifices made by family members of Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji  with immense reverence.
This martyrdom served as a new beacon of  learning for entire humanity; for the country.
This martyrdom served  towards the great deed of protecting our civilization.
We are indebted  to this martyrdom.
"Once again I bow to the martyrdom of shri Guru Tegh  Bahadur ji, Mata Gujari, Guru Gobind Singh ji and the four Sahibzade."
"Several such sacrifices have preserved the present fabric of India,  keeping it intact."
"My dear  countrymen, I am now going to tell you something that will gladden you  and make you feel proud as well."
"In India, between 2014 and 2018, the  number of leopards has risen by more than 60 percent."
"In 2014, the  number of leopards in the country was about 7,900, whereas in 2019 it  increased to 12,852."
"These are the very leopards about which Jim Corbett  had said: “Those who have not seen a leopard wandering free in nature,  cannot imagine its beauty…."
"cannot visualise the beauty of its colours  and the charm of its gait.” In most parts of the country, especially  central India, the number of leopards has risen."
"Amongst the states with  the maximum population of leopards Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and  Maharashtra are topmost in the order."
This is a big achievement for  year.
"Leopards, across the world have been facing dangers; their habitat  has faced loss in the entire world."
"In such circumstances, the  continued growth of the population of leopards in India has shown a way  to the entire world."
"You must also be aware that in the past few years,  the population of lions in India has risen; the number of tigers too has  increased. Also, there has been an increase in India’s forest area."
"the  reason for this is that not only the government but also many people,  civil society, many institutions too are engaged in conserving our trees  and plants and wild animals."
They all deserve accolades.
"Friends,  I read about a heart-touching effort at Coimbatore in Tamilnadu."
You  too must have seen visuals of this on social media.
"We have seen  wheelchairs for humans, but daughter Gayatri in Coimbatore, along with  her father, made a wheelchair for a suffering dog."
This sensitivity is  inspiring and can happen only when a person is filled with kindness and  compassion towards all life forms.
"In Delhi NCR and other cities of the  country in the chilling cold, many people are doing a lot for the care  of shelterless animals."
"They arrange for food, water, sweaters and even  beds for those animals."
Some people arrange food for hundreds of such  animals every day.
Such efforts should be commended.
"Several noble  efforts are being undertaken in Kaushambi, Uttar Pradesh."
"There, prison  inmates are making covers from old and torn blankets to protect cows  from the cold."
"Besides Kaushambi, these blankets are collected from  jails of other districts and then they are sewn and sent to gaushaalas,  cow shelters."
Prisoners of Kaushambi are sewing several covers every  week.
"Come, let us encourage such acts of care with a sense of service  to others."
"In fact, this is a noble act that strengthens the sensitivity  of the society."
"My dear countrymen,  the letter that is in front of me now bears two large photographs."
These  are photos of a temple and depict ‘before’ and ‘after’.
The letter  which is with these photos talks about a team of youth which calls  itself Yuva brigade.
"In fact, this Youth brigade has transformed an  ancient Shiva temple named Veerbhadra Swami in Srirangapatna in  Karnataka."
All around in the temple there were widespread weeds and  shrubs…so much that even travellers could not have recognized the  existence of a temple there.
"One day, some tourists posted a video of  this forgotten temple on social media."
When the Yuva brigade saw this  video on social media they could not bear it and this team decided to  renovate it together.
"They removed the thorny bushes, grass and plants  that had come up in the compound of the temple."
They did repair and  construction wherever required.
"Seeing their good deed, the local people  too extended a helping hand."
Some offered cement; others offered paint…  people came up with many other such contributions.
All these youths  belong to different professions.
"Hence, they took out time during  weekends and worked for the temple."
"They arranged for electricity  connection too for the temple besides getting doors installed, thus  restoring the old grandeur of the temple."
Passion and firm commitment  are two means through which people can achieve every goal.
"When I see  the youth of India, I feel delighted and assured."
Delighted and assured  because the youth of my country have the ‘Can Do’ approach and the ‘Will  Do’ spirit in them.
No challenge is too big for them.
Nothing is out of  reach for them.
I read about a teacher from Tamil Nadu.
"Her name is  Hemalata N. K., and she teaches the oldest language of the world Tamil  at a school in Villupuram."
Even the Covid 19 pandemic could not create  hurdles in her teaching work.
"She recorded all the 53 chapters of the  course, created animated videos, put them in a pen drive and distributed  that amongst her students."
Her students got a lot of help from this;  they understood the chapters visually.
"Along with this, she kept  interacting with her students telephonically."
"Thus, study became quite  interesting for the students."
"All over the country during this corona  time, the innovative methods that the teachers have adopted, the course  material they have creatively prepared, those are invaluable in this  period of online studies."
I request all the teachers to definitely  upload these course materials on the Diksha Portal of the Education  Ministry.
"This will help students who are staying in far-flung areas of  the country, a lot."
"Friends, let us  now talk of Hiraman ji of Korwa tribe of Jharkhand."
Hiraman ji lives in  the Sinjo village of Garhwa district.
"You will be amazed to know that  the population of Korwa tribe is merely 6,000, which lives in hills and  forests far away from cities.Hiraman ji has taken up the task of  preserving the culture and identity of his community."
After an untiring  toil of 12 years he has created a dictionary of the Korwa language which  is getting extinct.
"In this dictionary, he has written with meanings  many Korwa words right from words used in the household to words used in  daily life."
What Hiraman ji has done for the Korwa community is an  example for the country.
"My dear  countrymen, it is said that there was a prominent courtier in the court  of Akbar named AbulFazl."
"After a visit to Kashmir, he once remarked that  the place had one such scenic view that could uplift the mood of the  most irritable and bad tempered people, making them rejoice."
"In fact, he  was referring to the saffron fields in Kashmir."
Saffron has been  associated with Kashmir for centuries.
"Kashmiri saffron is mainly grown  in places like Pulwama, Budgam and Kishtwar."
"In May this year, the  Kashmiri Saffron was given the Geographical Indication Tag or GI tag."
"Through this, we want to make Kashmiri Saffron a Globally Popular Brand."
Kashmiri saffron is globally famous as a spice that has many medicinal  properties.
"It has a strong aroma, its color is deep dark and its  threads are long and thick which enhances its medicinal value."
It  represents the rich cultural heritage of Jammu and Kashmir.
"And if  you’re talking about the quality, the saffron of Kashmir is unique and  completely different from the saffron of other countries."
Saffron from  Kashmir has now got a distinct identity with the GI Tag recognition.
"You  will be delighted to know that after obtaining the GI Tag certificate,  Kashmiri Saffron was launched in a supermarket in Dubai."
Now its exports  will get a boost.
This will further strengthen our efforts to build an  Atmanirbhar Bharat.
Farmers growing saffron will be especially benefited  by this.
"Now take a look at the case of Abdul MajeedWani, a resident of  Shar area of Tral in Pulwama."
He is selling his GI Tagged Saffron with  the help of National Saffron Mission at the Trading Center in Pampore  through E-Trading.
Many people like him are involved in this activity in  Kashmir.
"Next time you decide to buy saffron, think of buying saffron  of Kashmir!"
"Only The warmth of Kashmiri people is such that it imparts a  unique, distinct flavor to the saffron."
"My  dear countrymen, just two days ago was Geeta Jayanti."
The Gita inspires  us in every context of our life.
But have you ever thought why is Geeta  such a wonderful Granth?
That is because it is the voice of Lord  Krishna himself.
But the uniqueness of the Gita also lies in that it  begins with the quest of knowledge… starts with a question.
"Arjuna asked  the Lord a question, inquired and only then, the world received the  wisdom of Gita."
"Like the Gita, all the wisdom in our culture starts with  inquisitiveness."
"The very first mantra of Vedanta is - 'Athaato Brahm  Jigyasa', that is, come, let us inquire about Brahm."
"That is why we talk  about the inquest of even Brahma, the ultimate creator!"
Such is the  power of inquisitiveness.
Curiosityconstantly inspires you to learn  something new.
"In childhood, we learn only because we are curious."
"That  is, we are alive as long as there is curiosity in us.As long as there is  curiosity, the process of learning something new continues."
"No age, no  circumstance, matters at all in this."
"I came to know of an example of  such energy of inquisitiveness, about Shri T. Srinivasacharya Swami ji,  an elderly person from Tamil Nadu!"
Shri T Srinivasacharya Swami Ji is  Ninety-Two years old.
"Even at this age, he is writing his book on the  computer; that too, typing himself."
You must be thinking that writing a  book is fine….
"but in the times of Srinivasacharyaji, there were no  computers."
"So, when did he learn the computer?"
It is right that there  was no computer during his college days.
"But, there still is as much  curiosity in his mind and self-confidence as it was in his youth."
"In  fact, Srinivasacharya Swamiji is a scholar of Sanskrit and Tamil."
He has  written about 16 spiritual books so far.
"However, with the advent of  the computer, when he realized that the method of writing and printing  books had changed, he learned the computer and necessary software at the  age of 86… yes, at the age of eighty-six."
Now he is completing his  book.
"Friends, Shri T Srinivasacharya  Swamiji’s life are a living example of the fact that life remains full  of energy, as long as the curiosity in life, the desire to learn, does  not die."
"Hence, we should never think that we lagged behind; we missed."
"“Only if…we too had learnt this!” We should not even think that we  cannot learn, or cannot move forward."
"My  dear countrymen, we were just talking about learning and doing  something new out of inquisitiveness."
We were also referring to new  resolutions in the New Year.
"But there are also some people who  continuously keep on doing something new, keep on fulfilling new  resolves."
"You too must have felt in life that when we do something for  society, the society itself gives us the energy to do a lot of things."
Significant deeds can be accomplished with seemingly simple  motivations.One such youth is Shriman Pradeep Sangwan!
Gurugram’s  PradeepSangwan has been running a campaign ‘Healing Himalayas’ since  2016.
He goes to different areas in the Himalayas with his team and  volunteers where they clean plastic waste dumped there by tourists.
"So  far, Pradeep ji has cleaned tons of plastic from various tourist  locations in the Himalayas."
"Similarly, there is a young couple from  Karnataka, Anudeep and Minusha."
Anudeep and Minusha got married just  last month in November.
"A lot of young people go for a trip after  marriage, but these two did something different."
"Both of them always saw  that people go out on a trip, but, wherever they go, they leave a lot  of garbage and waste behind."
A similar situation was prevailing at the  Someshwar beach in Karnataka.
Anudeep and Minusha decided that they  would clean up the garbage that people have left behind at the Someshwar  beach.
This was the first resolve that both husband and wife took after  marriage.
Together they cleaned up a lot of garbage from the beach.
Anudeep also shared about his resolve on social media.
"Inspired by his  magnanimous thought, a number of young people came and joined him."
You  will be surprised to know that together these people have cleaned more  than 800 kg of waste from Someshwar beach.
"Friends,  amidst these efforts, we also have to think how this garbage gets on  these beaches, these mountains in the first place."
"After all, it is one  amongst us only, who leaves this garbage there."
We should run a  cleanliness drive like Pradeep and Anudeep-Minusha.
"But even before that  we should also take a resolve that we will not leave garbage at all, to  begin with."
"After all, this is also the first resolution of the Clean  India campaign."
"And yes, I want to remind you of something more."
"Due to  Corona, this year it could not be discussed much."
We have to make our  country free from single use plastic.
This is also one of the  resolutions of 2021.
"In conclusion, I extend my best wishes to you for  the New Year."
"Stay healthy yourself, keep your family healthy too."
"Next  year, in January, 'Mann Ki Baat’ will touch upon new subjects."
Many thanks.
"My dear countrymen, Namaskar."
Let us begin today’s Mann Ki Baat with a phone call.]
Thank  you very much for your phone call.
My young friends have asked me many  questions related to Science; they keep writing on quite a few points.
"All of us have seen that the sea appears blue, but we know from routine  life experiences that water has no colour at all."
Have we ever thought  why water acquires colour in rivers and seas?
The same thought occurred  to a young man in the 1920s.
The same question gave rise to a great  scientist of modern India.
"When we talk about Science, the first name  that strikes us is that of Bharat Ratna Sir C.V.Raman."
He was awarded  the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
One of his  discoveries is famous as the Raman Effect.
"We  celebrate the 28th of February as National Science Day since on this  very day, he is said to have discovered the phenomenon of light  scattering, for which the Nobel Prize was conferred upon him."
This land  has given birth to many a great scientist.
"On the one hand, there has  been a tradition of great Mathematicians like Bodhayan, Bhaskar,  Brahmagupt and Aryabhatt; on the other, in the field of medicine,  Sushrut & Charak have bestowed upon us a place of pride."
Right from  Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose  have brought laurels to India.
The famous particle BOSON has been named  after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently I got an opportunity to take part in a  programme in Mumbai – the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute for  Artificial Intelligence.
It was interesting to know about the ongoing  miraculous accomplishments in the field of Science.
"Artificial  Intelligence aids in making robots, Bots and other machines meant for  specific tasks."
"Through self learning, machines today can enhance their  intelligence to a smarter level."
"This technology can be harnessed to  better the lives of the underprivileged, the marginalized and the needy."
"In that programme on Artificial Intelligence, I urged the scientific  community to deliberate on how Artificial Intelligence could help us  make life easier for our divyang brothers & sisters."
Can we make  better predictions of natural disasters using Artificial Intelligence?
Can we use it to provide assistance to farmers on crop yield?
Can  Artificial Intelligence be used as tool to simplify the outreach of  health services and modernize medical treatment?
"A  few days ago, I got an opportunity to accompany the Prime Minister of  Israel to Ahmedabad, Gujarat for the inauguration of ‘I create’."
There a  young person referred to developing a digital instrument that converts  the written word into voice. This is to aid those who are incapable of  speech to converse normally like any other person.
I feel we can harness  Artificial Intelligence in many such fields.
Science  and Technology are value neutral.
They don’t possess any value in  themselves.
Any machine will work the way we want it to.
It entirely  depends on us what task we want it to perform.
"The use of Science for the sole purpose of human  welfare, with the endeavour to assist human lives touch the greatest  heights."
"Thomas Alva Edison, the  inventor of the light bulb, failed many a time in his experiments."
"Once,  on being asked about it, he quipped, “I have devised ten thousand ways  of how NOT to make a light bulb”. What I mean to say is, Edison  transformed even his failures into his own strength."
"Coincidentally, I  am fortunate today to be in Auroville, the land, the karmabhoomi of  Maharshi Arvind."
"As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought  against them and questioned subjugation."
"Thus, as a great sage, he  questioned every facet of life. Extracting answers, he showed the right  path to humanity."
The relentless quest to ask questions for knowing the  truth is very important.
"And this is the very essence, the real  inspiration behind scientific inventions and discoveries."
"Never rest  till every ‘why’, ‘what’ & ‘how’ are answered."
"I congratulate our  scientists, and all those connected with Science on the occasion of  National Science Day."
May our young generation be inspired for the quest  of truth & knowledge; may they be motivated to serve society  through Science.
"Friends,  safety in the times of crises, disasters are topics on which many  messages keep coming in- people keep writing to me."
"In a comment posted  on Narendra Modi Mobile App, Shriman Ravindra Singh from Pune has  referred to occupational safety."
"He writes that in our country, safety  standards at factories and construction sites are not upto the mark."
"Since the 4th of March is National Safety Day, the Prime Minister should  include safety in the Mann Ki Baat programme in order to raise  awareness on safety."
"When we refer to public safety, two aspects are  very important- proactiveness and preparedness."
Safety is of two kinds –  one is safety during disasters and the other is safety in everyday  life.
"If we are not aware of safety in daily life, if we are not able to  attain a certain level, it will get extremely difficult during the time  of disasters."
"Beyond that, these sentences serve no purpose in our  lives."
Leave aside natural disasters; most of the mishaps are a  consequence of some mistake or the other on our part.
"If we stay alert,  abide by the prescribed rules & regulations, we shall not only be  able to save our own lives but we can prevent catastrophes harming  society."
There are times when we come across many slogans on safety at  the work place but none following their letter and spirit.
I urge the  fire brigade under corporations and municipalities to visit school  children once a week or once a month and perform mock drills for them.
This will have a dual benefit – the fire brigade will undergo an  exercise in readiness and the new generation will get lessons in  alertness.
And all this at no added cost.
In a way it will a natural  part of the overall learning curve.
India is a land of geographic and  climatic diversities.
"As far as disasters are concerned, this country  has borne the brunt of many a natural as well as man made disaster, such  as chemical & industrial mishaps."
"Today, the National Disaster  Management Authority, NDMA is the vanguard when it comes to dealing with  disasters in the country."
"During earthquakes, floods, cyclones,  landslides, NDMA reaches the area within no time."
They have issued  guidelines; simultaneously they keep imparting training on a regular  basis for capacity building.
"In Districts prone to floods and cyclones,  an initiative names ‘Aapada Mitra’ has been launched for training  Volunteers."
Training and awareness have a very important role to play.
"Two- three years ago, thousands of people would lose their lives every  year due to heat-wave."
"After that, NDMA organized workshops on heat wave  management as part of a campaign to raise awareness in people."
Mass  participation led to good results.
"In 2017, the death toll on account of  heat wave remarkably came down to around 220 or so."
"This proves that if  we accord priority to safety, we can actually attain safety."
"I laud the  role played by innumerable individuals, citizens who immediately embark  upon rescue and relief operations wherever a disaster strikes."
"And  there are numerous such unnamed, unsung heroes."
"Our Fire & Rescue  services, National Disaster Response Forces Armed Forces, Paramilitary  Forces… these brave hearts go beyond the call of duty to help people in  distress, often risking their own lives."
Organisations like NCC and  Scouts are also contributing in this task; they are getting trained too.
Recently we have made an attempt to have joint exercise for disaster  management between countries on the lines of joint military exercise  involving different countries of the world.
"India has made a pioneering  effort – BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand,  Bhutan & Nepal – a joint disaster management exercise involving  these countries was undertaken."
We’ll have to turn ourselves into a risk conscious  society.
"In our culture, we often talk of safety of values; we now need  to realize the values of safety."
"We’ll have to make it part of our life,  our being."
Was there a scope of direct visibility when the information  was given?
"Why? Because by nature, we are not conscious. And that is why our ears hear  when we sit in the aircraft, but no one realizes that ‘these  instructions are for me’."
We experience this in all walks of life.
"Let  us not think that safety is only meant for someone else. If all of us  become conscious and aware of our own safety, the essence of safety of  society will be inbuilt."
"My dear  countrymen, in the current budget, emphasis has been laid on turning  ‘waste to wealth’ and ‘waste to energy’ through Bio gas, under the  Swachch Bharat Campaign."
An effort was initiated which was named  GOBAR-Dhan - Galvanizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
The aim of this  GOBAR- DHAN scheme is ensuring cleanliness in villages and generating  wealth and energy by converting cattle dung and solid agricultural waste  into Compost and Bio Gas.
"India is home to the highest cattle  population in the world, close to 300 million in number, with a daily  output of 3 million tonnes of dung."
Some European countries and China  use animal dung and other Bio-waste to produce energy. But India was  lacking full capacity utilization.
"Under the Swachch Bharat Mission  (Rural), we are taking rapid strides in this direction."
"A  target has been set to use cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen  waste to produce Bio gas based energy."
Under the Gobardhan Scheme our  farmer brothers & sisters in rural India will be encouraged to  consider dung and other waste not just as a waste but as a source of  income.
"Under the aegis of 'GobarDhanYojana', many benefits will accrue  to rural areas."
Biogas generation will increase self-reliance in energy utilized for  cooking and lighting.
Farmers and cattle herders will be helped in  augmenting their income.
"There will be novel opportunities for newer  jobs linked to waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc."
"An  online trading platform will be created for better implementation of  'Gobar Dhan Yojana', it will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers  can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste."
"I urge  entrepreneurs, especially our sisters residing in rural India, to step  forward."
I invite you to  become part of the movement comprising clean energy and green jobs.
"But in a unique endeavor in Raipur,  Chhattisgarh, the state's first 'Trash Mahotsav' was organized."
The  objective behind this festival sponsored by Raipur Municipal Corporation  was to generate awareness about cleanliness.
"A plethora of activities were  organized during this festival, which found full participation of  students and adults."
Music performances linked to the theme of  hygiene were held .
Raipur inspired various  types of such garbage or trash festivals in other districts too.
A festive atmosphere  regarding cleanliness got geared up.
The way the school children took  part in the entire endeavor was amazing.
"For the innovative manner in  which importance of waste management and cleanliness were displayed in  this festival, I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal  Corporation, the entire populace of Chhattisgarh, its government and  administration."
"Every year on March  8, 'International Women's Day' is celebrated."
There are many programs  that are held in our country and the world.
"On this day, women are also  felicitated with 'Nari Shakti Puraskar' who have performed exemplary  tasks in different sectors in the past."
Today the country is moving  forward from the path of Women development to women-led development.
"On  this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda."
He’d said 'The  idea of ​​perfect womanhood is perfect independence' - This idea of  ​​Swami ji about one hundred and twenty five years ago expresses the  contemplation of woman power in Indian culture.
"Today, it is our duty to  ensure the participation of women in every field of life, be it social  or economic life, it is our fundamental duty."
"We are part of a tradition  where men were identified due to women-Yashoda-Nandan,  Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Putra, these were identities of a son."
"Today  our woman power has shown inner fortitude and self-confidence, has made  herself self-reliant."
Not only has she advanced herself but has carried  forward the country and society to newer heights.
"After  all, our dream of 'New India' is the one where women are strong and  empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country."
"A  few days ago, a gentleman had given me a very sound proposition."
"Why  cannot we felicitate mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in  every Indian village or city,?"
"I just received news from Jharkhand  wherein under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan', about 1.5 million women in  Jharkhand – and this figure is not a small one organized a hygiene  campaign for an entire month!"
"Under the auspices of this campaign  starting from January 26, 2018, these women constructed 1 lakh 70  thousand toilets in just 20 days and made a record of sorts."
"There were  about one lakh ‘Sakhi Mandals,’ 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women  Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water carriers, 10 thousand  female cleaners and 50 thousand women masons were involved in this  campaign."
You can imagine what a mammoth undertaking it was!
"These women  of Jharkhand have shown that women power is an integral component of  ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’, which will change the course of the campaign of  cleanliness in general life, the effective role of hygiene in the  nature of the people ingeneral."
"My  dear Brothers and sisters, I was just watching the TV news two days ago  that electricity has reached three villages of the Elephanta island  after 70 years of independence, and this has led to much joy and  enthusiasm among the people there."
"You all know very well, that  Elephanta is located 10 kms by the sea from Mumbai."
It is a very  important tourist destination.
The caves of Elephanta are marked as the  World Heritage sites by UNESCO .
I  congratulate the administration and the populace there.
I am glad that  now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted  due to electrification.
"This is not just electricity, but a new  beginning of a period of development."
There is no greater contentment  and joy than the fact that the lives of the countrymen be full of shine  and there be happiness in their lives.
"My  dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of  Shivaratri."
"And now the month of March beckons us with ripe crops in the  fields, playful golden earrings of wheat and the captivating blossom of  mango pleasing to the mind are the highlights of this month."
But this  month is also very special to all of us because of the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March the entire country immersed in joy will celebrate the  festival of Holi.
"In The festival of Holi, the importance of colors is  as important as the ceremony of 'HolikaDahan' because it is the day when  we burn our inherent vices in the fire."
"Holi makes us forget our  rancours and gives us an opportunity to be a part of each other's  happiness and glad tidings, and it conveys the message of love, unity  and brotherhood."
"I wish a very joyous festival of Holi to all my  countrymen, I further wish you colour laden felicitations."
I wish and  hope that this festival forever remains a festival of colourful cheer in  the lives of all the countrymen- this is my wish.
"My dear countrymen,  thank you very much"
"My  dear countrymen, I am fortunate to have got an opportunity once again to  greet citizens from Kutch to Kohima, Kashmir to Kanyakumari; in fact  across the length & breadth of the country."
Namaskar to all of you.
"Reflecting on the expanse & diversity of our land, revering them  fills each & every Indian with a sense of pride."
"And an opportunity  to experience this varied diversity is one that touches the heart,  filling it up with joy; it is a flower that radiates inspiration."
"A few  days ago, at a small place at the Hunar Haat in Delhi, I witnessed hues  of our country’s diverse expanse, cultures, traditions, cuisines &  the warmth of emotions."
Listening  to a divyang woman at the Hunar Haat was a source of fulfillment.
She  told me that earlier she used to sell paintings on the pavement.
Her  life changed after she connected with Hunar Haat.
"Today,  she is not only self- reliant; she has purchased a house too."
"At Hunar  Haat, I got the opportunity to converse with many other artisans."
I am  told that over 50 per cent of the crafts persons participating at Hunar  Haat are women.
"Also, during the last three years, through Hunar Haat,  close to three lakh artisans & crafts persons have gained many  opportunities of employment."
"Hunar Haat, of course, is a platform  showcasing art & craft; it is also lending wings to people’s dreams."
It is a venue where it is impossible to overlook the country’s  diversity.
"Besides handicrafts, it displays the diversity of India’s  varied cuisine too."
"In a single row, one could savour the sight of Idli-  Dosa, Chhole- Bhature, Daal- Baati, Khaman- Khandvi & what not!"
I  thoroughly enjoyed having the delicious Litti- Chokha of Bihar.
"All over  India, fairs & exhibitions such as this are organized from time to  time."
"Whenever the opportunity arises, one should attend such events to  know India, to experience India."
"Thus, not only would you be able to be a  part of the country’s art-culture canvas; you will also contribute in  the progress & prosperity of hardworking crafts persons, especially  women."
"Throughout the year, India is home to many migratory species."
We are told that more than 500 varieties of birds fly in from varied  regions.
"Recently, Gandhinagar was host to the COP- 13 convention, where  this phenomenon was mulled over, discussed and deliberated."
India’s  efforts concerning the subject were lauded too.
"Friends, it is a matter  of pride for us that for the next three years, India will chair the COP  convention on migratory species."
"Very recently,  biologists have discovered a new species of fish whose habitat is within  the caves of Meghalaya."
It is believed that this fish is the largest  among aquatic species found under the surface of caves.
"It lives in  deep, dark underground caves, with little chance of light reaching in."
Scientists are perplexed at the ability of this large fish to survive in  such deep caves.
"It is a matter of joy that our India, and especially  Meghalaya is home to a rare species."
It lends a new facet to India’s  bio-diversity.
"We are surrounded by many such mysteries, which are still  undiscovered."
To discover such a phenomenal enigma calls for fierce  detective passion.
"The great Tamil poetess Avvaiyar writes: Kattat Kemaavoon Kalladaru Udgadvu, Kaddat Kamiyan Adva Kalladar Olaaadu."
Similar is the case with the biodiversity  of this country.
Our biodiversity too is a unique treasure for  the entire human kind.
"Record satellite launches into  space, new records, new missions fills up every Indian heart with a  sense of pride."
"When I was in Bengaluru during Chandrayan-2, I witnessed  immense enthusiasm & fervor on the part of the children present  there."
"One can never forget their  inquisitiveness when it came to Science, Technology and Innovation."
"To  give a fillip to this very enthusiasm in children & young people; to  encourage scientific temper in them, another system has been put in  place."
"You can now sit & watch rocket launching at Sriharikota,  taking place in front of your own eyes."
"Recently, the facility has been  made open for all."
"A visitors’ gallery has been erected, large enough to  seat 10 thousand people."
Online booking is also possible through a link  provided on ISRO’s website.
I am told that many schools are arranging  tour for their students to show them rocket launching and motivate them.
I urge the Principals & teachers of all schools that they should  avail of this benefit in times to come.
"Friends,  I would like to convey to you another exciting piece of information."
"I’d read the comment of Paras from Dhanbad, Jharkhand on Namo App."
Paras  wants me to tell our young friends about ISRO's 'Yuvika' programme.
Yuvika' is a very commendable effort on part of ISRO to integrate the  youth with science.
This program was launched for school students in the  year 2019.
"This  program is in consonance with our vision, ""Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai  Vigyan, Jai Anusandhaan’."
"In this programme, students, after their  exams, during their holidays, visit different centres of ISRO and learn  about Space Technology, Space Science and Space Applications."
you must read the experience of those who have  attended its earlier sessions.
"My  dear countrymen, the beautiful valleys of Ladakh witnessed a momentous  event on the 31st of January 2020."
A mixture of 10% Indian Bio-jet fuel was used in this flight  and this was the first time that this mix was used in both engines.
"Not  just that, but the airport from which this plane took off from Leh is  not only one of the highest altitude airports in India but also in the  world!"
It is procured from various tribal areas of India.
These efforts  will not only reduce carbon emissions but may also reduce India's  dependence on crude oil imports.
"I congratulate all the people involved  in this significant mission, especially the scientists of CSIR and  Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun, who made it possible to develop  the technology to fly an aircraft with bio-fuel."
Our new India is not willing to tag along with the old  approach.
"In particular, our sisters and mothers of New India are going  ahead and grasping the challenges hands on."
"I have also been told that Kamya, who has  made the country proud, is now on a new mission, which is called  'Mission Saahas'."
Under this she is trying to conquer the highest peaks  of all the continents.
I wish  Kamya all the best for 'Mission Saahas'.
Fitness has also contributed  in great measure in Kamya’s achieving great heights at such a young  age.
"A Nation that is fit, will always be a nation that is a hit."
By the  way the oncoming months are very opportune for adventure sports.
The  geography of India is such that it provides many opportunities for  adventure sports in our country.
"Our 105 year old Bhagirathi Amma, also gives  us this inspiration."
"Now you would be wondering, who Bhagirathi Amma is!"
Bhagirathi Amma lives in Kollam in Kerala.
She lost her mother when she  was very young.
"Soon after her marriage at a young age, she lost her  husband as well."
"But Bhagirathi Amma did not let go of her courage, did  not lose her spirit."
She had to quit school before she was 10-years-old.
She restarted her school education at the age of 105!
"She started  studying again!In spite of her advanced age, Bhagirathi Amma wrote her  level 4 exam…and then eagerly awaited her results."
She scored 75 percent  in her exams.
Today I specially salute Bhagirathi Amma.
This is the  story of Salman who lives in Hamirpur village of Moradabad.
Salman is  divyang by birth.
He is unable to stand on his feet.
"Despite this  hardship, he hasn’t lost hope, and decided to start his own business."
"On  top of that, he resolved to help other divyang people people too."
"And  soon enough, Salman started manufacturing slippers and detergent in his  village itself."
"And in no time, 30 divyang people joined him."
The important  thing is that Salman trained his divyang colleagues himself.
"Now all of  them jointly not only manufacture the products, but also market them."
"Today, all of them together manufacture 150 pairs of slippers a day."
"Not  just that, this year Salman has resolved to provide employment to 100  more such divyang mates."
I salute their courage and their enterprise.
A  similar determination has been manifested by residents of Ajrak village  in Kutch area of Gujarat.
"The  villagers not only nurtured their ages-old art form, but also fused it  with modern fashion."
The hardworking village folk have today  turned ‘Ajrak print’ into a major brand.
"My  dear countrymen, recently the festival of Maha Shivaratri was  celebrated throughout the country."
The blessings of Lord Shiva and  Mother Parvati has kept the ethos of this nation awakened.
"On the  occasion of Mahashivaratri, may you continue to be blessed by Bhole  baba…may Lord Shiva fulfill all your wishes…may you be energetic,  healthy…and continue to do your duties unto the country."
"Friends,  along with Mahashivaratri, now the splendour of spring will keep  blooming day by day."
"In the coming days, we will celebrate Holi and soon  after that, Gudi Padva will be celebrated."
The festival of Navaraatri  is also associated with spring.
Ram Navami will also be celebrated.
Festivals and celebrations are an inseparable part of the social fabric  of our country.
"Every festival has a hidden social message which binds  not just the society, but the entire country into a spirit of unity."
"After Holi, from the Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, the Indian Vikrami New  year also begins."
"For that too, please accept my greetings in advance."
"My  dear countrymen, I think students will be busy with their examinations  till the next Mann Ki Baat."
"Those who have completed their examinations,  will be carefree."
Many many thanks.
Namaskaar.
Yesterday was the festival of Magh Poornima.
"The month of Magh is regarded related especially to rivers, lakes and  water sources."
"In the  month of Magh, a bath in any holy water body is considered sacred."
"In  every society of the world, invariably, there is one tradition or the  other with respect to a river."
Many civilizations have evolved along the  banks of rivers.
"Since our culture is thousands of years old, the  spread of this phenomenon is more evident here."
"There must not be a  single day in India, when there is no festival connected with water in  some corner of the country or the other."
"During the period of Magh,  people even leave their homes, near and dear ones, comforts and  amenities to perform KALPVAAS on the banks of rivers."
"This time, in  Haridwar, KUMBH too is being held."
"For us, water is life; faith too and  the flow of development as well."
"In a way, water is more important than  PARAS, the philosopher’s stone."
"It is said that with the touch of a  PARAS, iron gets turned into gold."
"Similarly, the touch of water is  necessary for life; imperative for development."
"Friends,  possibly there is another reason to associate the month of Magh with  water – after this, winters come to an end and summers start knocking."
"Hence, for the conservation of water, we should begin efforts right  away."
"A few days later, just on the 22nd of the month of March, it’s  World Water Day."
has written to me that millions of people in the world spend a major  part of their lives in overcoming water shortage.
"It has not been said  without reason, ‘BIN PAANI SAB SOON’ – without water, everything comes  to a naught!"
"In order to solve the water crisis, Sujit ji of North  Dinajpur has sent me a very nice message."
Sujit ji has written that  Nature has bestowed upon us a collective gift in the form of Water;  hence the responsibility of saving it is also collective.
"It is correct  that just as there is a collective gift, there is a collective  accountability too."
Sujit ji’s thought is absolutely correct.
"River,  lake, pond or ground water – all of these are for everyone."
"Friends,  there was a time when in villages, people would collectively look after  wells and ponds."
"Now one such effort is underway at Thiruvannamalai,  Tamilnadu."
"Here, local people have been running a campaign for the  conservation of their wells."
These people are rejuvenating public wells  in their vicinity that had been lying unused for years.
The  endeavour of Babita Rajput ji of village Agrotha in Madhya Pradesh will  inspire all of you.
Babita ji’s village is in Bundelkhand.
"Close to her  village, once there was a very large lake which had dried up."
She  mobilized other women of the village itself and built a canal to bring  water to the lake.
"Through this canal, rainwater started flowing  directly into the lake."
Now this lake remains filled with water.
"Friends,  the work of Jagdish Kuniyal ji, resident of Bageshwar, Uttarakhand also  teaches us a lot."
Jagdish ji’s village and the adjoining area were  dependent on a natural source for their water requirements.
"But many  years ago, the source dried up."
This led to worsening of the water  crisis in the entire area.
Jagdish ji decided to solve the crisis  through tree plantation.
"Along with fellow villagers, he planted  thousands of trees over the entire area…and today, the dried up water  source at the place is filled to the brim once again."
"Friends,  similarly, we shall have to understand our collective responsibilities  with regard to water."
"In most parts of India, rainfall begins in  May-June."
Can we right away start a 100 day campaign for the sake of  cleaning up water sources around us and conserving rainwater?
"With this  very thought in mind, in a few days from now, Jal Shakti Abhiyan CATCH  THE RAIN is being initiated by the Jal Shakti Ministry."
"Its credo is  ‘CATCH THE RAIN, WHERE IT FALLS, WHEN IT FALLS’."
"We shall commit  ourselves to the task right now…we shall get existing rain water  harvesting systems repaired, clean up lakes and ponds in villages,  remove impediments in the way of water flowing into water sources; thus  we shall be able to conserve rainwater to the maximum."
"My  dear countrymen, whenever a discussion on the month of Magh and its  spiritual-social significance takes place, the discourse is never  complete without one name – the name is that of Sant Ravidas ji."
Sant  Ravidas ji’s birth anniversary falls on the very day of Magh Poornima.
"Even today, the words, the knowledge of Sant Ravidas ji guide us on our  path."
"He’d said: EKAI MAATI KE SABH BHAANDE, SABH KA EKAU SIRJANHAAR | RAVIDAS VYAAPAI EKAI GHAT BHEETAR, SABH KAU EKAY GHADAI KUMHAR "
Sant Ravidas ji always expressed himself openly on  the social ills that had pervaded society.
"He laid bare social evils in  front of society, showed the path of redemption; and that’s why Meera ji  had said, ‘GURU MILIYA RAIDAS, DEENHI GYAAN KI GUTKI’ ."
I have experienced the spiritual loftiness of Sant  Ravidas ji’s life and his energy at the pilgrimage site.
"Friends,  Ravidas ji used to say ‘KARAM BANDHAN MEIN BANDH RAHIYO, PHAL KI NA TAJJIYO AAS."
"Meaning,  we should incessantly strive with our Karma, our work; the Phal, the  reward is bound to come your way."
Our youth must learn one more thing from Sant  Ravidas ji.
"For doing any work, they should not bind themselves to old  methods and practices."
Decide and shape your life yourself.
"Devise your  own methods and practices, set your goals yourselves."
"If your conscience  and self confidence is unshakeable, you need not fear anything in the  world."
I say so since often due to  pressures of traditional thinking our youth are not able to do what they  really like.
"That is why you should never hesitate in thinking new,  doing new."
In the same manner Sant Ravidas ji has given another  important message.
This message is ‘to stand on one’s own feet’.
It is  not fair at all that we remain dependant on others for our dreams.
Things remaining to continue the way they are… Ravidas ji was never in  favour of this.
"Today, we see that the youth of the country too is not  at all in favour of this thinking."
"Today when I see the innovative  spirit of the youth of the country, I feel Ravidas ji too would have  definitely felt proud of our youth."
"My  dear countrymen, today happens to be the ‘National Science Day’ too."
"The day is dedicated to the discovery of ‘Raman Effect’ by the great  scientist of India, Dr C. V. Raman."
Yogeshwaran ji from Kerala has  written on NamoApp that the discovery of Raman Effect had changed the  direction of science in its entirety.
Snehil ji from Nasik too has sent  me a very good message connected with this.
Snehil ji has written that  there are many scientists from our country without whose contribution  science would not have progressed as much.
"The way we know of other  scientists of the world, in the same way we should also know about the  scientists of India."
I too agree with this view of these listeners of  ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
"I definitely would want that our youth know, understand  and read a lot about the history of science of India ; about our  scientists as well."
"Friends, when we  talk of science then many a time people restrict it to physics-chemistry  or labs, but the spread of science is much more than that. And there is  a lot of contribution of the power of science in the ‘Atmanirbhar  Bharat Campaign’."
We have to move science forward with the mantra of  ‘Lab to Land’.
Chintala Venkat Reddy  ji from Hyderabad is an example.
A doctor friend of Reddy ji once told  him about the diseases caused by deficiency of vitamin D and the dangers  thereof.
"Reddy ji is a farmer, he thought about what he could do about  solving this problem."
After this he worked a lot and developed breeds of  wheat and rice that specially contained vitamin D. 
Our Government is fortunate that Venkat Reddy was also honoured  with the Padmashree last year.
"Similarly,  Urugen Futsog of Ladakh too is working very innovatively."
"At those  heights Urugen is growing about 20 crops organically, that too in a  cyclic way, that is, he utilises the waste of one crop as manure for the  other crop."
Isnt’ it amazing?
In the  same way Kamraj Bhai Choudhary from Patan district in Gujarat has  developed good seeds of drum stick at home itself.
Some people call drum  stick as Sargava or Moringa.
Drum sticks that are grown with the help  of good seeds are of good quality too.
Now by sending his produce to  Tamil Nadu and West Bengal he is raising his income also.
"Friends,  nowadays you must be hearing a lot, the name of Chia seeds."
People  connected to health awareness give a lot of importance to it and it has a  lot of demand too in the world.
"In India, it is mostly sourced from  abroad but now people are taking up the challenge to be self-reliant in  Chia seeds too."
"Similarly, Harishchandra ji of Barabanki in UP has begun  farming of Chia seeds."
Cultivation of Chia seeds will also increase his  income and will help in the self-reliant India campaign too.
"Friends,  many experiments of creating wealth from agricultural waste too are  being run successfully in the entire country."
"Like, Murugesan ji from  Madurai made a machine to make ropes from waste of banana."
"This  innovation of Murugesan ji will solve the issues of environment and  filth too, and will also pave the way for additional income for the  farmers."
"Friends, the purpose of  talking about so many people to the listeners of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is that  we all should get motivated by them."
"When every citizen of the country  will spread the spirit of science in his life and in every field,  avenues of progress will also open up and the country will become  self-reliant too."
And I do believe that every citizen of the country can  do this.
"My dear friends, Ranjan ji  from Kolkata, in his letter, has raised a very interesting and  fundamental question and along with that, has tried to answer it in the  best way."
He asks what it means to us when we talk of becoming  self-reliant.
"In answer to this very question, he himself further writes  that- “’Self reliant India” is not just a Government policy, but is a  national spirit."
"He believes that being self-reliant means deciding  one’s own fate, that is controlling one’s own destiny."
Ranjan babu is a  hundred percent correct.
"Furthering what he has said, I too would say  that the first condition for self-reliance is to have pride in the  things of one’s own country; to take pride in the things made by people  of one’s own country."
"When every countryman takes pride, every  countryman connects; self-reliant India doesn’t remain just an economic  campaign but becomes a national spirit."
"When we see fighter plane Tejas  made in our own country doing acrobatics in the sky, when Made in India  tanks, Made in India missiles increase our pride, when we see Made in  India coaches in Metro trains in wealthy-advanced nations, when we see  Made in India Corona Vaccines reaching dozens of countries, then our  heads rise higher."
And it is not that only bigger things will make India  self-reliant.
"Textiles made in India, handicraft goods made by talented  artisans of India, electronic appliances of India, mobiles of India, in  every field we have to raise this pride."
"When we move forward with this  thought, only then will we become self-reliant in the truest sense… and  friends, I am happy that this mantra of self-reliant India is reaching  the villages of the country."
"This very thing happened in Bettiah, about  which I got to read in the media."
"A  resident of Bettiah, Pramod ji worked as a technician in an LED bulb  manufacturing factory in Delhi. During his work in the factory, he  understood the intricacies of the entire process in great detail."
But  during corona Pramod ji had to return to his home.
Do you know what  Pramod ji did after returning? He himself started a small unit to  manufacture LED bulbs.
He brought along some youngsters from his area  and completed the journey from being a factory worker to becoming a  factory owner in a few months ; that too while living in his own house.
There  is one more example from Garhmukteshwar in UP.
"Shriman Santosh Ji from  Garhmukteshwar, has written how during the Corona outbreak he turned  adversity into opportunity."
Santosh ji's ancestors were craftsmen par  excellence ; they used to make mats.
"When everything came to a halt at  the time of Corona, these people began mat making with great energy and  enthusiasm."
"Soon, they started getting orders for their mats not only  from Uttar Pradesh, but also from other states."
Santosh ji also narrated  that with this the hundreds of years old beautiful art of this region  has received a new strength.
"Friends,  there are many examples across the country where people are  contributing in a similar manner to the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan'."
"Today it has become a sentiment, flowing in the hearts of common folk."
"My  dear countrymen, I saw an interesting post by Mayur, a resident of  Gurgaon, on the NaMo App."
He is a passionate bird watcher and a nature  lover.
"Mayur ji has written that while he lives in Haryana, he wishes us  to touch upon the people of Assam, and in particular, the people of  Kaziranga."
"I thought that Mayur ji would talk about the Rhino, hailed as  the pride of Kaziranga."
But Mayur ji instead has asked for appreciation  of the people of Assam for the rise in the number of Waterfowls in  Kaziranga.
"I was searching for a common term to describe Waterfowls in  simple terminology, and found the word - Jalpakshi - Birds that nest not  on the trees but on the water, such as ducks and others."
The  Kaziranga National Park & ​​Tiger Reserve Authority has been  carrying out its Annual Waterfowls Census for some time.
This Census  reveals the population of water birds and also about their favorite  Habitat.
"Just two-three weeks ago, the survey was conducted again."
You  will also be delighted to know that this time the number of water birds  has increased by about one hundred seventy five (175%) percent compared  to last year.
A total of 112 Species of Birds have been sighted in  Kaziranga National Park during this Census.
"And of these, 58 species  happen to be winter migrants from different parts of the world including  Europe, Central Asia and East Asia."
"The most important reason for this  is that here, there is better water conservation along with very little  human interference."
"However, in some cases, positive human interference  is also very important."
Just take the  example of Shri Jadav Payeng of Assam .
He has received the Padma award for his work.
Shri  Jadav Payeng is the person who actively contributed in raising about 300  hectares of plantations in the Majuli Island in Assam.
He has been  constantly working for forest conservation and is also involved in  motivating people for Plantation and conservation of biodiversity.
"Friends,  our temples in Assam are also playing a unique role in the protection  of nature. If you take a look at our temples, you will find that every  temple has a pond in the vicinity."
"The Hayagriva Madheb Temple at Hajo,  the Nagashankar Temple at Sonitpur and the Ugratara Temple at Guwahati  have many such ponds nearby."
They are being used to save near extinct  species of turtles.
Assam is home to the highest number of species of  turtles.
The ponds of theses temples can become excellent sites for  their conservation and breeding and training about them.
"My  dear countrymen, some people think that it is necessary to be a  scientist to do innovation and some believe that it is essential to be a  teacher to teach something to others."
Those who challenge this line of  thinking are worthy of praise.
"Now for example if anyone trains someone  to become a soldier, is it necessary for him to be a soldier?"
"You may be  thinking that yes, it is necessary."
But here is a little twist!
"On  MyGov app, Kamalakant ji has shared a media report which states  something different."
There is a gentleman in Arakhuda in Odisha - Nayak  Sir.
"Although his name is Silu Nayak, everyone addresses him as Nayak  Sir."
In reality he is a man on a mission!
He imparts free training to  the youth who want to join the army.
The name of the organization of  Nayak Sir is Mahaguru Battalion.
The training touches upon all the  aspects from physical fitness to interviews and writing to training.
"You  will be surprised to know that the people this organization has  trained, have secured their places in uniformed forces such as the Army,  Navy, Air Force, CRPF and BSF."
"By  the way, you will also be amazed to know that Silu Nayak ji had himself  tried to get recruited in Odisha Police but could not succeed. Despite  this, on the basis of his own training, he has made many youth worthy of  national service."
"Come, let us all wish Nayak Sir greater success for  preparing more heroes for our country."
"Friends,  sometimes even a very small and simple question rankles the mind."
"These  questions are not very long ; they are very simple, yet they make us  think."
A few days ago Aparna Reddy ji of Hyderabad asked me one such  question.
She said “You have been PM for so many years and were CM for  so many years. Do you ever feel that something is missing?
Aparna ji's  question seems simple but is equally difficult.
"I pondered this over and  told myself that one of my shortcomings was that I could not make much  effort to learn Tamil, the oldest language in the world ; I could not  make myself learn Tamil!"
"It is such a beautiful language, which is  popular all over the world."
Many people have told me a lot about the  quality of Tamil literature and the depth of the poems written in it.
"India is a land of many languages, which symbolizes our culture and  pride."
"Speaking of language, I want to share a small, interesting clip  with you. Actually,  what you were listening to now is a guide at the Statue of Unity,  informing people in Sanskrit about the tallest statue of Sardar Patel in  the world."
"You will be happy to know that there are more than 15 guides  in Kevadiya, who guide people in fluent Sanskrit."
Now I present to you  one more voice – (SOUND CLIP CRICKET COMMENTARY) You  too would have been surprised to hear this.
"Actually, this is a cricket  commentary being done in Sanskrit."
"In Varanasi, a cricket tournament is  held among Sanskrit colleges."
"These colleges are - Shastharth College,  Swami Vedanti Ved Vidyapeeth, Sri Brahma Veda Vidyalaya and  International Chandramouli Charitable Trust."
Commentary is also done in  Sanskrit during the matches of this tournament.
I just played for you a  very small part of that commentary.
"Not only this, in this tournament,  players and commentators are seen in the traditional attire."
"If you want  energy, excitement, suspense all at once, then you should listen to the  sports commentaries."
"Long before the advent of TV, sports commentary  was the medium through which people of the country felt the thrill of  sports like cricket and hockey."
The commentary for tennis and football  matches is also very well presented.
"We have seen that games in which  commentaries are vibrant, they get promoted and gain popularity very  fast."
"Here too, we have many Indian sports, where commentary culture has  not permeated yet and due to this they are in a state of near  extinction."
"I have a thought - Why not have good commentaries of  different sports and especially Indian sports in more and more  languages, we must think about encouraging it."
I would urge the Sports  Ministry and private institutional partners to think about it.
"My  dear young friends, the coming few months are of special importance in  the lives of all of you."
Most of the young friends will have exams.
"Do  all of you remember – You have to become a warrior not a worrier, go  gleefully for the examination and come back with a smile."
"You have to  compete with yourself, not with anyone else."
Get adequate sleep and be  mindful of time management.
"Do not stop playing, for those who play are  the ones that blossom."
"Revision and smart methods of memorization are to  be adopted, that is, overall, in these exams, you have to bring out  your best."
You must be thinking how all this will be possible.
We’re  going to do it together.
"Like every year, this year too we will have  'Pariksha Pe Charcha’."
"But before the 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' to be held  in March, I request all of you exam warriors, parents and teachers to  share your experiences, your tips."
You can share on MyGov platform and  Narendra Modi app.
"This time, along with the youth, parents and teachers  are also invited to 'Pariksha Pe Charcha'."
"You will get all the  information on MyGov - how to participate, how to win the prize, how to  get an opportunity to discuss with me."
"So far, more than one lakh  students, about 40 thousand parents, and about 10 thousand teachers have  participated."
You too participate today itself.
"In the times of Corona,  I took out some time, added many new mantras in the exam warrior book;  some for the parents as well."
A lot of interesting activities related to  these mantras are given on the Narendra Modi App which will help to  ignite the exam warrior in you.
Do try them.
Best wishes to all my young  friends for the upcoming exams.
"My  dear countrymen, the month of March is also the last month of our  financial year, therefore, it will be a very busy period for many of  you."
"The way economic activities are intensifying in the country, the  activities of our business and entrepreneur friends are also increasing."
"In the midst of all these, we should not lower our guard against  Corona."
"May all of you be healthy, be happy, stay steadfast on the path  of duty and service and the country will continue to move ahead fast."
Best wishes in advance to all of you for the festivals; there should not  be any laxity in the rules regarding Corona as well.
Many many thanks.
"My dear countrymen, Namaskar!Welcome  to 'Mann Ki Baat' once again."
Today we will commence 'Mann Ki Baat'  mentioning India's success.
"In the beginning of this month, India has  been successful in bringing home an invaluable heritage of hers from  Italy."
This heritage is the over one thousand years old idol of  Avalokiteshvara Padmapani.
"This idol was stolen a few years ago from  Kundalpur temple, Devi Sthan  of Gaya ji in Bihar."
"But after innumerable efforts, India has now got  this idol back."
"Similarly, a few years ago the idol of Lord Anjaneyaar,  Hanuman ji was stolen from Vellore in Tamil Nadu."
This idol of Hanuman  ji was also 600-700 years old.
"Earlier this month, we retrieved this in  Australia; our Mission has received it."
"Friends,  in our history of thousands of years, idols, one better than the other  were always being made in various parts of the country; it also  comprised reverence, capability, skill and was full of varied diversity."
And the history of each of our idols also depicts the influence of  their respective times.
Not only were they a wonderful artistic example  of Indian sculpture; our faith was also connected with them.
"But, in the  past, many idols were stolen and kept being taken out of India."
"Sometimes in this country, at times in another, these idols were sold...  and for them they were just pieces of art."
"Neither did they have  anything to do with their history, nor with reverence attached to them."
It is our responsibility towards Mother India to bring home these idols.
These idols embody a part of the soul of India; faith as well.
They  also have a cultural-historical significance.
"Realising this  responsibility, India increased her efforts."
"And resultantly, it  fostered a deterrent fear against the tendency to steal."
"The countries  where these idols were stolen and taken away to, also started to feel  now that it could also have immense significance in the diplomatic  channel of soft power in relations with India."
"India's feelings are  associated with it; India's reverence is attached as well, and, in a  way, it creates a lot of strength in people-to-people relations as well."
"Just a few days ago you must have noted that the idol of Ma Annapurna  Devi, which was stolen from Kashi, was also brought back."
This is an  example of the changing global outlook towards India.
"Till the year  2013, nearly 13 idols had been brought back to India."
"But, in the last  seven years, India has successfully brought back more than 200 precious  idols."
"Many countries such as America, Britain, Holland, France, Canada,  Germany, Singapore have understood this sentiment of India and helped  us to retrieve these idols."
"When I went to America in September last  year, I came across a lot of very old idols and many artefacts of  cultural importance there."
"Whenever any priceless heritage returns to  the country, it is naturally a matter of great satisfaction for all of  us....as an Indian, as one who has reverence for history and  archaeology, one connected with faith and culture."
"Friends,  talking about Indian culture and our heritage, today I want to  introduce you to two people in 'Mann Ki Baat'."
"These days, two Tanzanian  siblings, Kili Paul and his sister Nima, are in the news a lot on  Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and I'm sure you too, must have heard  about them."
"They have a passion, a craze for Indian music and for this  reason they are also very popular."
Their technique of Lip Sync shows how  hard they work at it.
"Recently, a video of him singing our National  Anthem 'Jana Gana Mana' on the occasion of Republic Day went viral."
"A  few days ago, he also paid a soulful tribute to Lata didi by presenting  her song."
I really appreciate these two siblings Kili and Nima very much  for their wonderful creativity.
"A few days ago, he has also been  honoured at the Indian Embassy in Tanzania."
The magic of Indian music is  such that it fascinates everyone.
"I recall, a few years ago,  singers-musicians from more than one hundred and fifty countries of the  world, in their respective countries, in their respective costumes, made  a successful presentation of 'Vaishnav Jan', the beloved bhajan of  revered Bapu, the favourite composition of Mahatma Gandhi."
"Today,  when India is celebrating the important festival of 75th year of its  Independence, similar initiatives can be carried out regarding patriotic  songs, wherein foreign nationals or famous singers from abroad are  invited to render Indian patriotic songs."
"Not only this, if Kili and  Neema in Tanzania can lip sync the songs of India in this manner, aren’t  there many types of songs in my country... in many languages ​​​​of our  country... can’t any Gujarati children do that with Tamil songs....some  children of Kerala could do that with Assamese songs.... some Kannada  children could that with songs of Jammu and Kashmir!"
We can create such  an environment in which we will be able to experience 'Ek  Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat'.
"Not only this, we can definitely celebrate  Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav in a novel way."
I urge the youth of the country  to make videos of the popular songs of Indian languages ​​in their own  way.... you will become very popular!
"And the diversity of the country  will be introduced to the new generation.My  dear countrymen, just a few days ago, we celebrated International  Mother Language Day."
"Those who are learned can give a lot of academic  input about where the word mother tongue came from, how it originated."
"I  would emphasise about mother tongue that as our mother moulds our life,  in the same manner, mother tongue also shapes our life."
"The mother and  mother tongue, both together strengthen the foundation of life; lending  it permanence."
"Just like we cannot abandon our mother, similarly, we  cannot leave our mother tongue either."
"I remember an incident of  yesteryears, when I had gone to America, I would get a chance to visit  different families."
Once I went to a Telugu family and I got to see a  very happy scenario there.
"They told me that they had made a rule in the  family that no matter how busy one were to be, if they were not  outstation, then all the family members would have dinner sitting at the  table together and equally compulsory on the dinner table was  conversing in Telugu language only."
This was also the rule for the  children who were born there.
"Seeing this love for the mother tongue, I  was highly impressed by this family."
"Friends,  even after 75 years of independence, some people are facing a mental  dilemma due to which they have reservations with regard to their  language, their dress, their food and drink, whereas, it is not like  this anywhere else in the world."
It is our mother tongue; we should  speak it with pride.
"And, our India is so rich in terms of languages  ​​that it just cannot be compared."
"The biggest beauty of our languages  ​​is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kohima, hundreds of  languages, thousands of dialects which are different from each other  but are mutually integrated...many languages - one expression."
"For  centuries, our languages have been evolving whilst learning from each  other and ​​have been refining themselves, developing each other."
The  world’s oldest language Tamil is in India and every Indian should be  proud that we have such a significant  heritage of the world.
"In the same way, many ancient scriptures are  also there; their expression too is in our Sanskrit language."
The people  of India are proud to be associated with 121 forms of mother tongues  and 14 of these languages ​​are spoken by more than 1 crore people in  everyday life.
"That is, many European countries do not have a total  population than the people who are associated with 14 different  languages ​​in our country."
"In the year 2019, Hindi was ranked third  among the most spoken languages ​​of the world."
Every Indian should be  proud of this too.
"Language is not just a medium of expression, but also  serves to preserve the culture and heritage of the society."
Surjan  Parohi ji is doing similar work in Suriname to save the heritage of his  language.
He turned 84 on the 2nd of this month.
"His forefathers also  went to Suriname years ago, along with thousands of workers, to earn a  living."
Surjan Parohi ji writes very good poetry in Hindi; his name is  considered among the national poets there.
"That is, even today Hindustan  beats in his heart; there is a fragrance of the soil of India in his  works."
The people of Suriname have also built a museum in the name of  Surjan Parohi ji.
"It is very heartening for me that in the year 2015 I  had the opportunity to honour him.Friends, today, that is, 27th February is also Marathi Bhasha Gaurav Divas."
"“सर्व मराठी बंधु भगिनिना मराठी भाषा दिनाच्या हार्दिक शुभेच्छा|” This  day is dedicated to Marathi Kaviraj, Vishnu Vaman Shirvadkar ji,  Shriman Kusumagraj ji."
Today is also the birth anniversary of Kusumagraj  ji.
"Kusumagraj ji wrote poems in Marathi, wrote many plays, and took  Marathi literature to new heights."
"Friends,  our languages have their own special characteristics; mother tongue has  its own science."
"For understanding this science, emphasis has been laid  on studies in the local language in the National Education Policy."
Efforts are being made that our professional courses should also be  taught in the regional languages.
"In Azadi Ka Amrit Kaal, we all should  lend momentum to this effort together; this is a work indicative of  self-respect."
I would like you to know about the qualities of whatever  mother tongue you speak and write something in it.
"Friends,  A few days ago I had a meeting with my friend and former Prime Minister  of Kenya, Raila Odinga."
This meeting was interesting but also very  emotional.
"Since we are very good friends, we also discuss freely."
"While  both of us were in a conversation, Odinga ji told about his daughter."
His daughter Rosemary had a brain tumour and because of this she had to  undergo surgery.
"However, one side-effect of this was that Rosemary  almost lost her eyesight; she stopped seeing."
"You can imagine what must  have happened to the daughter.... and we can also guess the condition of  the father, we can understand his feelings."
"In hospitals all over the  world... there was not any major country in the world, where he had not  tried his best for the treatment of his daughter."
"He searched the big  countries of the world, but, there was no success and in a way, giving  up all hopes, there was an atmosphere of despair in the entire  household."
"Meanwhile, someone suggested him to come to India for  Ayurveda treatment and even though he had tried a lot and was tired, yet  he thought that let's try once again... see what happens!"
"He came to  India, started getting his daughter treated at an Ayurvedic hospital in  Kerala."
The daughter stayed here for a long time.
The effect of this  Ayurvedic treatment was such that Rosemary's eyesight returned to a  great extent.
"You can imagine, as if a new lease of life was given and  light came back into Rosemary's life."
"As the new light has come in the  whole family, Odinga ji was so emotional while telling me this and that  he wishes, that the knowledge and science of Ayurveda of India, should  be brought to Kenya."
The type of plants that are used in it will be  cultivated by them and he will do his best to get more people to benefit  from it.It  is a matter of great happiness for me that from our land and our  tradition have alleviated such a great suffering from someone's life.
You will also be happy to hear this.
Which Indian would not be proud of  it?
We all know that not only Odinga ji but lakhs of people across the  world are reaping similar benefits from Ayurveda.
Prince  Charles from Britain is also one of the big admirers of Ayurveda.
"Whenever I meet him, he definitely mentions Ayurveda."
He is also aware  of many Ayurvedic institutions of India.
"Friends,  in the last seven years a lot of attention has been paid to the  promotion of Ayurveda in the country."
The formation of the Ministry of  AYUSH has further strengthened our resolve to popularise our traditional  methods of medicine and health.
I am very happy that in the last few  years many new start-ups have emerged in the field of Ayurveda.
The  AYUSH Start-up Challenge started earlier this month.
The goal of this  challenge is to identify and support the start-ups working in this  field.
"I urge the youth working in this field, that they should take  part in this challenge."
"Friends,  once people are determined to do something together, they do wonderful  things."
"There have been many such big changes in the society, in which  public participation, collective effort, has played a significant role."
"One such mass movement named ""Mission Jal Thal"" is underway in Srinagar,  Kashmir."
This is a unique effort to clean the lakes and ponds of  Srinagar and restore their old glory.
The focus of “Mission Jal Thal” is  on “Kushal Saar” and “Gil Saar”.
"Along with public participation, a lot  of help of technology is also being taken in this."
"To find out where  there has been encroachment, where illegal construction has taken place,  a formal survey of this area was carried out."
"Along with this, a  campaign to remove plastic waste and clean up the waste was also  launched."
"In the second phase of the mission, a lot of effort was also  made to restore the old water channels and 19 springs filling the lake."
"In order to spread more and more awareness about the importance of this  Restoration Project, local people and youth were also made Water  Ambassadors."
"Now the local people here are also taking efforts for  increasing the number of migratory birds and fish in ""Gil Saar Lake"" and  are also happy to see it."
"My heartiest congratulations to the people of  Srinagar for this wonderful effort.Friends,  the 'Clean India Mission' started by the country eight years ago, with  the passage of time, it expanded manifold... new innovations were also  added."
"Wherever you go in India, you will find that some effort is being  made for cleanliness everywhere."
"I have come to know about one such  attempt in Kokrajhar, Assam."
Here a group of morning walkers have taken a  very commendable initiative under the 'Clean and Green Kokrajhar'  mission.
All of them gave a motivational message of cleanliness by  cleaning the three kilometre long road in the new flyover area.
"Similarly, under the 'Clean India Campaign' in Visakhapatnam, cloth bags  are being promoted instead of polythene."
People here are also  campaigning against Single Use Plastic products to keep the environment  clean.
"Along with this, these people are also spreading awareness to  segregate the waste at home."
The students of Somaiya College in Mumbai  have also included beautification in their campaign of cleanliness.
They  have decorated the walls of Kalyan railway station with beautiful  paintings.
An inspiring example from Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan has  also come to my notice.
"The youth here have started a campaign named  'Mission Beat Plastic' in Ranthambore, in which plastic and polythene  have been removed from the forests of Ranthambore."
"This spirit of Sabka Prayas,  everyone's effort strengthens public participation in the country and  when there is public participation, even the biggest goals are  definitely met."
"My  dear countrymen, just a few days from today, International Women's Day  will be celebrated all over the world on 8th of March."
"We have been  sharing many examples related to the courage, skill, and talent of women  in 'Mann Ki Baat'."
"Today, whether it is Skill India, Self Help Group,  small or big industries, women have taken the lead everywhere."
"Wherever  you see, women are dispelling old myths."
"Today, in our country, From  Parliament to Panchayat, women are reaching newer heights in different  fields."
"In the Army too, daughters are now playing responsibilities in  new and bigger roles and are protecting the country."
Last month on  Republic Day we saw that daughters were flying modern fighter planes  too.
"The country also lifted the restrictions on the admission of  daughters in Sainik Schools, and daughters are taking admission in  Sainik Schools all over the country."
"Similarly, look at the start-up  world, in the recent years, thousands of new start-ups began in the  country."
About half of these start-ups have women in director roles.
"In  the recent past, decisions like increasing maternity leave for women  have been taken."
The country is trying to give equal rights to sons and  daughters by fixing a common age for marriage.
"Due to this, the  participation of women is increasing in every field."
You must be  noticing another major change happening in the country.
This change is  the success of our social campaigns.
"Take the success of 'Beti Bachao,  Beti Padhao'... today the sex ratio in the country has improved."
The  number of girls going to school has also improved.
In this we also have a  responsibility that our daughters do not drop out of school.
"Similarly,  women in the country have got freedom from open defecation under the  'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'."
A social evil like triple talaq is also coming  to an end.
"Ever since the law against triple talaq has come into being,  there has been a reduction of 80 percent in triple talaq cases in the  country."
How are all these changes happening in such a short span of  time?
"This change is coming because women themselves are now leading the  change and progressive efforts in our country.My dear countrymen, tomorrow the 28th  of February is 'National Science Day'."
This day is also known for the  discovery of Raman Effect.
"Along with CV Raman ji, I pay my respectful  tribute to all the scientists who have contributed significantly in  enriching our scientific journey."
"Friends, technology has secured an  important place in our lives in the realm of ease and simplicity."
"Which  technology is good and what is the better use of that technology, we are  well acquainted with all these subjects."
"But, it is also true that the  basis of that technology, the underlying science is something that we  neglect in conveying to the children of our family."
"On this Science Day,  I urge all the families to definitely start with small efforts to  develop a scientific temperament in their children."
"Now,  for example – poor vision... after wearing glasses, vision improves  with clarity... children can easily be explained on the science behind  it."
It’s not that one should restrict oneself to just looking at the  glasses and enjoying.
Now you can simply explain to the child on a small  piece of paper.
"Now the child uses a mobile phone...how does a  calculator work, how does a remote control work, what are sensors?"
"Along  with this, are such scientific elements also discussed in the house?"
"Maybe we can easily explain these things behind the everyday functioning  of the household, what is the inherent science behind a phenomenon."
"In  the same way, have we ever indulged in stargazing together with the  children?"
There must have been conversations about stars in the night.
"Different constellations appear, tell them about them."
By doing this you  can create a new interest in children towards physics and astronomy.
"Nowadays, there are also many apps through which you can locate the  stars and planets, or, you can identify the star which is visible in the  sky and can also know about it."
I will also tell our start-ups that you  should employ your skills and scientific character in the work related  to nation-building.
This is also our Collective Scientific  Responsibility towards the country.
"Like, nowadays I see that our  start-ups are doing very well in the world of virtual reality."
"In this  era of virtual classes, one such virtual lab can be designed keeping  children in mind."
We can also make children experience a chemistry lab  sitting at home through virtual reality.
My request to my teachers and  parents is to encourage all the students and children to ask questions  and together with them find the right answers to those questions.
"Today,  I would also like to appreciate the role of Indian scientists in the  fight against Corona."
"Due to their hard work, it was possible to  manufacture the Made In India vaccine, which has helped the whole world a  lot."
"This is the gift of science to humanity.My  dear countrymen, this time too we discussed many subjects."
Many  festivals are lined up in the coming month of March... Shivratri... A  few days later we will all will start preparing for Holi.
Holi is a  festival that unites us all.
"In this festival, all differences between  near-dear ones and strangers, big and small, rancour and envy disappear."
That is why it is said that the colours of love and harmony are thicker  than the colours of Holi.
"Along with Gujiya in Holi, there is a unique  sweetness of relationships as well."
"We have to strengthen these bonds  further, and relations are not only with the people of our family but  also with the people who are part of your larger family."
You have to  remember the most important way to do so.
This is the way of celebrating  the festival through 'Vocal for Local'.
"You should buy local products  on festivals, so that the lives of the people living around you also  become colourful and vibrant."
The success with which our country is  fighting the battle against Corona and moving forward is imparting  enthusiasm to the festivals manifold.
"With this very zeal, we have to  celebrate our festivals, and at the same time, we have to maintain our  caution."
I wish you all a very Happy festival season.
"I will always be  waiting for your words, your letters and your messages."
Thank you very much!
"My dear countrymen, Namaskar."
"The mega festival of Chatth, celebrated 6 days after Diwali,  is one of those festivals which are celebrated in accordance with  strict rituals & regimen. In everything associated with it like  cuisine or attire, traditional norms are adhered to."
The unique  festival Chhath Pooja is deeply linked with nature  & worshipping nature.
"Surya & Jal –The Sun & Water are  central to the veneration in Chhath, whereas utensils made  of bamboo & clay and tubers are an essential part of the Pooja  articles."
"In this mega festival of faith, veneration of the rising sun  and worship of the setting sun convey a message that is replete with  unparalleled Sanskar."
"The world respects & venerates those who rise;  the Chatth Pooja bestows upon us the sanskaar to  respect & revere those whose setting, whose dusk is imminent."
The  expression of the significance of cleanliness in our lives is intrinsic  to this festival.
"Before the advent of Chatth, people come  together to clean up their homes, and along with that cleansing of  rivers, lakes, pond banks and pooja locations, that is ghats, with  utmost enthusiasm & fervour."
"Sun worship or Chhath Pooja is a festival of protecting the environment, ushering in wellness and discipline."
"Usually, people shy away from borrowing from others. But in Chhath Pooja,  it is specially customary to ask for Prasad after the morning Arghya  ritual."
"It is believed that the rationale behind this tradition is that,  it destroys his ego."
It is natural for each one of us to feel proud of this great  tradition of India.
"My dear  countrymen, ‘Mann - Ki - Baat’ has garnered accolades; it has also  attracted criticism. But whenever I look at the overall outcome of ‘Mann Ki Baat’,  it reinforces my belief, that it is intrinsically, inseparably woven  into the warp & weft of our common citizens’ lives, cent per cent."
Take the examples of Khadi and handloom. On Gandhi Jayanti I have always  advocated the use of handloom and Khadi.
"You  will be glad to know that on the 17th of this month on the day of Dhanteras,  the Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan store in Delhi witnessed a record sale of  Rupees one crore, twenty lakhs."
You too must be feeling happy with a  sense of satisfaction at this mega sale in just one Khadi & Handloom  store.
"During Diwali, Khadi gift coupon sales  recorded an overwhelming 680 per cent rise."
"Compared to last year, the  total sales of Khadi & Handicrafts have risen almost by 90%."
"One can clearly see that today, the youth, the elderly, women, in fact  every age group is taking to Khadi & handloom."
"I  can imagine how many weaver families, poor families, and the families  working on handlooms must have benefitted from this."
"Khadi was Khadi  foundation earlier and we talked of Khadi fashion but with my recent  experience I can say that after Khadi for nation and Khadi for fashion  now, it is becoming Khadi for transformation."
Khadi and handloom have  transformed the lives of the poorest of the poor and are emerging as a  powerful means of empowering them.
It is playing a very important role  for gramodaya.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on NarendramodiApp that he wants to know about my experience of celebrating Diwali with security forces and he also wants to know how the security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shriman  Tejas Gaikwad has also written on NarendramodiApp whether there could  be an arrangement to send our homemade sweets to the security forces.
We  also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our homemade  sweets must reach our country’s soldiers.
All of you must have  celebrated Deepawali with traditional fervour.
"To me, Diwali brought a special experience."
Luckily I got another chance to celebrate Deepawali with our courageous and brave heart security personnel.
Memories of Diwali celebrations  with our security forces in Gurez sector of Jammu & Kashmir will  stay long cherished in my heart.
"On behalf of all our countrymen, I  salute every soldier of our security forces who guard the country’s  borders with utmost dedication and a spirit of sacrifice, braving all  odds."
Whenever we get a chance or whenever there is an opportunity we  must try to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their  tales of valour.
Many of us may not be aware that the jawans of our  security forces play an important role not only on our borders but they  play a very vital role in establishing peace the world over.
"As UN  Peacekeepers, they are bringing glory to the nation in the comity of  nations."
United Nations Day was observed recently all over the world on  the 24th of October.
Everybody  recalls the efforts and constructive role of the UN in establishing  peace throughout the world.
"And, we are believers in “Vasudhaiv  Kutumbakam” which means the whole world is our family."
"And with this  belief, India has been cooperating very actively in various important  initiatives   taken by the UN."
You may be aware that the  preface of the Indian Constitution and the preface of the UN Charter;  both start with the words ‘We the people’.
India has always stressed on  the importance of equality for women and the UN Declaration of Human  Rights is a living example of this.
"In  its initial phrase, it was proposed as ‘all men are born free and  equal’ which was amended and adopted as ‘all human beings are born free  and equal’ with the efforts of the Indian representative Hansa Mehta."
It  appears to be a minor change but it reflects a vision of a healthy  thought.
India’s most important contribution under the UN umbrella is  its role in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
India has always been extending  active support to UN Peace Missions.
Many  of you may be getting to know this for the first time.
More than 18  thousand Indian security personnel have lent their services in UN  Peacekeeping Operations.
"Presently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers  are associated with UN Peacekeeping initiatives which is the third  highest number of soldiers from any country."
"Till August 2017, Indian  soldiers had lent their services in about 50 of the total of 71  Peacekeeping operations undertaken by the UN the world over."
"These  operations have been carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam,  Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many other parts of the  world."
In Congo and Southern Sudan more than twenty thousand patients  were treated in hospitals of the Indian army and countless lives were  saved.
Indian security forces have  not only saved people in various countries but also won their hearts  with their people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a  leading role in peace keeping efforts.
Very few people may know that  India was the first country which sent a female police unit to Liberia  for the United Nations Peace Mission.
And see how this initiative from  India became a big source of motivation for other countries too.
"Later,  all countries started sending their women police units."
You will surely  feel proud to know that India’s contribution is not limited to just  peacekeeping operations but it is also providing training to  peacekeepers from about eighty five countries.
The brave peacekeepers  from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Budha have sent a message of  peace and amity around the world.
Peacekeeping operation is not an easy  task.
Jawans from our security forces have to perform duties in  difficult and remote areas.
They have to live amongst many different  people.
They need to know and adapt to various situations and different  cultures.
They have to mould themselves according to the local needs and  environment.
"While remembering our brave UN Peacekeepers today, who can  forget the sacrifice of Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria who laid down  his life while fighting in Congo in Africa?"
Every  Indian feels proud while remembering him.
"He was the only UN  peacekeeper, a brave-heart, who was awarded the Param Veer Chakra."
Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one among those Indian Peacekeepers  who carved a special niche for themselves in Cyprus.
"In 1989, at the age  of 72, he was appointed the Force Commander for an operation in Namibia  and he gave his services to ensure the Independence of that country."
"General Thimaiyya, who had been India’s army chief, lead the UN  Peacekeeping force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for those peace  efforts."
"India has always been giving a message of peace, unity and  harmony to the world."
We believe that everyone must live in peace and  harmony and move ahead to carve a better and peaceful tomorrow.
"My  dear countrymen, our holy land has given great souls who selflessly  served humanity."
"Sister Nivedita, whom we also know as Bhagini Nivedita,  was one such extraordinary person."
She was born in Ireland as Margret  Elizabeth Noble but Swami Vivekanand gave her the name NIVEDITA. And  Nivedita means the one who is fully dedicated.
"And, it is inscribed on her grave – “Here reposes  Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India”."
She later proved herself  true to her name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
She  was so impressed by Swami Vivekanand that she renounced her happy-  prosperous life and dedicated herself to the service of the poor.
Sister  Nivedita felt very hurt by the atrocities of the British rule.
The  Britishers not only made us slaves but they tried to enslave us mentally  as well.
Constant efforts to belittle our culture and make us feel  inferior were on.
Bhagini Nivedita ji revived the dignity and pride of  Indian culture.
She brought the people together by infusing a sense of  national-awakening.
She travelled to various countries and raised her  voice against the mischievous propaganda against Sanatan Dharma and  ideology.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanya Bharati is well  known for his revolutionary poem Pudhumai Penn or New woman and is renowned for his efforts for Women empowerment.
It  is said that Bhagini Nivedita was the inspiration.
Bhagini Nivedita ji  also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
She helped  publication of Basu’s research and publicity through her articles and  conferences.
This is India’s unique beauty that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Sister  Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are a powerful testimony to  this.
"In 1899, plague broke out in Calcutta and hundreds of people lost  their lives in no time."
"Sister Nivedita, without caring for her health,  started cleaning drains and roads."
She was a woman who could live a  luxurious life but she dedicatedly worked for the poor.
"Getting  inspiration from her sacrifice, people came forward and joined her."
"Through  her work, she spread the message of the importance of cleanliness and  service to mankind."
"And, it is inscribed on her grave – “Here reposes  Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India”."
"Undoubtedly, she did so."
There cannot be any other befitting tribute to this great soul than  every Indian taking a lesson from her life and emulating  her.
Thank you for  your phone call.
"First of all, many felicitations to all the children on  the occasion of Children's Day celebrated on the birthday of our first  Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji."
Children are the emerging heroes in  the creation of new India.
"Your concern is correct that the diseases  which surfaced in old age, or emerged around the last lap of life - have  started to appear in children nowadays."
"It is indeed surprising today,  when we hear that children are suffering from diabetes."
"In  earlier times, such diseases were known as 'Raj-Rog' which means  diseases."
Such diseases were very rare in young people.
But our lifestyle  has changed.
Today these diseases are known as ‘lifestyle disorders.’  One of the main reasons for being afflicted with such diseases at a  young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the  changes in our eating habits.
Society  and the family need to pay attention towards this crisis.
"If you’ll  start paying attention to it, you will see that there is no need to do  anything extraordinary."
"You just need to make small regular changes in  order to transform your habits, making them a part of your way of life."
I  would like the family to consciously try to inculcate in children the  habit of playing in open grounds.
"If possible, we can make the elder  family members accompany these children to the playground and play with  them."
The children can be made to  take the stairs instead of taking the lift.
"After dinner, the entire  family can go for a walk with the children."
"Yoga for Young India. Yoga  will be helpful for especially our young friends, in maintaining a  healthy lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorders."
The  practice of Yoga 30 minutes before school can impart much benefit.
"It  can also be practised at home and the specialty of Yoga is that it is  easy, simple and accessible to all. I am saying this because a person of  any age can easily practise it."
"It is simple because it can be easily  learned and it is accessible, since it can be done anywhere. No  special tools or fields are needed."
There are several studies being  conducted on how Yoga is effective in curbing diabetes.
These studies  are being carried out in AIIMS too and the results that have emerged so  far are very encouraging.
Do not look at Ayurveda and Yoga as a means of  medical treatment only; instead of this we should make them a part of  our life.
"My dear countrymen,  especially my young friends, we have been getting glad tidings from the  field of sports."
"In different games, our athletes have made the country  proud."
"In hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey title through its  dazzling performance."
"Our players performed magnificently and on the  basis of their sterling efforts, India has become the Asia Cup champion  after an interval of ten years."
India had earlier won the Asia Cup in  Hockey in the years 2003 and 2007.
I extend felicitations on behalf of  the entire nation to the entire team and support staff.
"After  hockey, good news for India also came in badminton."
Badminton star  Kidambi Srikanth has filled every Indian’s heart with pride by clinching  the Denmark Open title with his excellent performance.
"I congratulate our young friend, Kidambi Srikanth  for this feat and enhancing the prestige of India."
"Friends,  the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month."
Teams from all  over the world came to India and all of them exhibited their skills on  the football field.
I also got an opportunity to go and watch a match.
There was a lot of enthusiasm among the players and the spectators.
This  world cup was a super event where the whole world was watching you.
"Such a big spectacle, I was astounded to see the energy, enthusiasm, and  zeal of all the young players."
The world cup was successfully organized  and all the teams performed their best.
"Regardless  of the fact that India could not win the title, the young players of  India won the hearts of everyone."
The whole world including India  enjoyed this mega festival of sports and this whole tournament was both  full of interest and entertainment for football lovers.
The signs that  the future of football is very bright have started to appear.
"I extend  my congratulations and good wishes to all the players, their colleagues,  and all the sports lovers once again."
"My  dear countrymen, a multitude of people write to me about ‘Swachch  Bharat’, I feel that if I have to do justice to their feelings then I  will have to do the program ‘Mann Ki Baat’ every day and every day ‘Mann Ki Baat’  will be dedicated solely to the subject of cleanliness."
Some listeners  send photo graphs of the efforts undertaken by children whereas others  mention the role of youth in these efforts.
Sometimes there is a story  of an innovation to bring about cleanliness or winds of change that get  ushered due to an official’s zeal.
A  few days ago I received a very detailed report highlighting the story of  transformation of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
An NGO called  Ecological Protection Organization launched a cleanliness campaign in  Chandrapur Fort.
"In this campaign lasting for two hundred days, people  performed the task of cleaning the fort, non-stop, without any fatigue  and with team-work."
Just think Two-hundred-days of continuous labour!
They sent me photographs with a caption- ‘Before and After’!
"I was  overwhelmed on seeing these and whoever will see these photographs, no  matter how upset he is on witnessing the filth around him, and wondering  how the mission of cleanliness will be fulfilled - then I have to tell  such people that you can see for yourself the toil, resolve and  determination of the members of the Ecological Protection Organization,  in these living pictures."
"Just on  seeing these pictures, your disappointment will transform into hope."
"This mammoth effort of bringing about cleanliness is a wonderful example  of fostering aesthetics, co-operation and continuum."
Forts are symbols  of our heritage.
And it is the duty of all countrymen to keep our  historical heritage safe and clean.
"I congratulate Ecological Protection  Organization, their entire team and the people of Chandrapur."
"My dear countrymen, we’ll celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of  November."
Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only the first guru of Sikhs; he’s  guru to the entire world.
He envisioned the welfare of all humanity and  considered all castes to be equal.
He stressed on women empowerment and  respect for women.
Guru Nanak Dev ji undertook a 28 thousand kilometre  journey on foot and throughout the journey spread the message of true  humanity.
"He entered into a dialogue with people and showed them the  path of truth, sacrifice & dedication."
"He advocated the message of  equality in society, not through mere words but through concrete  endeavour."
He ran a LANGAR which sowed the seeds of the spirit of  service amongst fellow beings.
Partaking of LANGAR together created a  feeling of unity & oneness in people.
"Guru Nanak Dev ji voiced three  messages for a meaningful, fulfilling life- Chant the name of the  Almighty, work hard and help the needy."
"In order to convey his ideals,  Guru Nanak Dev ji composed the Gurbani."
"Come 2019, we are going to  celebrate the 550th PRAKASH VARSH of Guru Nanak Dev ji."
"Come, let us try & advance on the path of his ideals & teachings."
"My dear countrymen, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji, two days from now, on the 31st of  October."
"All of us know that he was the one who laid the foundation  stone of modern, unified India."
We can learn a lot from the unparalleled  saga of this great son of Mother India.
The 31st of  October was also the day on which Smt.
Indira Gandhi left this world.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s speciality was that he not only put forth  revolutionary ideas; he was immensely capable of devising practical  solutions to the most complicated problems in the way.
Translating a  thought into reality was his forte’.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took on  the reins of weaving a unified India.
He ensured that millions of  Indians were brought under the ambit of one nation & one  constitution.
His decision making ability infused in him the strength to  overcome all obstacles.
"Wherever the use of force was imperative, he did not  hesitate."
He set a definite goal and moved forward on its path with grit  & determination.
It was only he who could achieve this task of  uniting India. He conceived a nation where everyone was equal. One ideal  of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will always be inspiring to all of us.
"He  had said “No division of caste or creed should be able to stop us, all  are the sons & daughters of India, all of us should love our country  and we should carve out our destiny on the foundation of mutual love  & harmony."
"These lofty ideals of  Sardar Sahab are relevant to and inspiring for our vision for a New  India, even today."
And that is why his birthday is celebrated as  National Unity Day.
His contribution in giving a unified texture to the  nation is without parallel.
"On the occasion of the birth anniversary of  Sardar Sahab, Run for Unity will be organized throughout the country,  which will see the participation of children, youth, women, in fact  people of all age groups."
"I urge you to participate in Run for Unity,  the festival of mutual harmony."
"My dear countrymen, you must’ve returned to your respective routines after the Diwali vacation, with a new resolve, with a new determination."
"May all your dreams come true, my best wishes to you."
Many many Thanks.
"My dear countrymen, Namaskar."
"During this ongoing period of Corona, the whole world is going through numerous phases of transformation."
"Today, when the two yard social distancing has become imperative, this very crises period has also served in fostering bonding among family members, bringing them even closer."
"But, for such an extended span of time and when you are together, spending time with each other. How do you ensure that every moment is filled with joy?"
"Thus, many a family, faced challenges- and the reason being a lack of our traditions that once used to streamline the course of life through adherence to certain values in the family ‘The Sanskar Sarita.’ It seems, there are many families where all this has been lost…and that is why amid the dearth, it became a little difficult for families to spend time in this period of crisis. And what was an important aspect in this?"
"Well, there was a time when in every family, invariably, there used to be an elderly member, a senior person who would tell stories, infusing a new inspiration, a new energy in the household."
"Surely, we must have realised, how significant the mores and conventions set by our ancestors are, even today.... how their dearth can be deeply felt!"
"And, as I said, one such form is the art of storytelling."
"Friends, the history of stories is as ancient as the human civilization itself."
"‘Where there is a soul, there is a story’. Stories express and bring to the fore, the creative and sensitive facets of human beings."
"If the power of stories is to be felt, one has to just watch a mother telling a story to her little one either to lull her to sleep or while feeding her a morsel."
"I spent a major part of my life as a Parivrajak, an ascetic. Wayfaring was my life."
""
"Every day it used to be a new place and people, new families. But whenever I went to a family, I would make it a point to speak to the children. At times, I would playfully ask them to tell me a story…..surprisingly, they would reply saying, No Uncle…not a story…We’ll tell you a joke! ""“They would ask me too to tell them a joke, evidently they had no clue of stories."""
"It was jokes that had pervaded their lives, in a major way."
In India there has been a rich tradition of storytelling or Qissagoi.
"We are proud to be denizens of the land that nurtured the tradition of Hitopadesh and Panch Tantra in which, through an imaginary world of animals, birds and fairies woven into stories, lessons on prudence and wisdom could be explained easily."
We have a tradition of ‘katha’ here.
This is an ancient form of religious storytelling.
‘Kathakalakshepam’ has been part of it.
Myriad folk tales are prevalent here.
"In Tamilnadu and Kerala, there is a very interesting style of storytelling."
It is called ‘Villu paat’.
It comprises a fascinating confluence of story and music.
"India has had a vibrant tradition of Kathputli, that is puppetry."
"These days, stories and storytelling based on science and science- fiction are gaining popularity."
I am noticing people who are taking commendable initiatives in promoting the art form of Qissagoi.
"I came to know about the website ‘Gathastory.in’, run by Amar Vyas, along with other colleagues."
Amar Vyas after completing his MBA from IIM Ahmedabad went abroad and later returned.
"Presently, he lives in Bengaluru and takes time out to pursue an interesting activity such as this, based on storytelling."
There are many endeavours that are popularising stories from rural India.
People like Vaishali Vyawahare Deshpande are making this form popular in Marathi.
"Srividya Veer Raghavan of Chennai is also engaged in popularizing and disseminating stories related to our culture, while two websites named, Kathalaya and The Indian Story Telling Network, are also doing commendable work in this field."
"Geeta Ramanujan has focussed on stories at kathalaya.org, whereas a network of story tellers from various cities is being created through the Indian Storytelling Network."
"There is Vikram Sridhar in Bengaluru, who is very enthusiastic about stories related to Bapu."
Many more such people must be working in this field. You must share about them on social media.
"Today, we are joined by our sister Aparna Athare and other members of the Bengaluru Storytelling Society."
"Come, let’s talk to them and learn about their experience."
How are you?
"How are you, Aparna ji?"
Very well Sir.
"First of all, I would like to thank you on behalf of Bangalore Story Telling Society for having invited and speaking to artists like us on this platform."
"Prime Minister: - And I heard, that today, perhaps your entire team is also sitting with you."
Absolutely sir.
Then it would be better if you introduce your team.
So that the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' can get acquainted with what a huge campaign you all are running.
"I am a mother of two children, the wife of an Air Force Officer and a passionate storyteller sir."
Storytelling began 15 years ago when I was working in the software industry.
"Having gone then for voluntary work for CSR projects, I got a chance to educate thousands of children through the medium of stories. And this story I was referring to, I had heard it from my grandmother."
"But when I saw the joy on the children’s faces while listening to the story, what do I say to you.... such smiles, so much happiness there... and that was the moment I decided that story telling would be a goal of my life sir."
- Who else is there in your team?
- Shailaja Sampath is with me.
 - Namaskar sir.
- I am Shailaja Sampath speaking.
"Earlier, I was a teacher. Once my children grew up, I started working in theatre and finally, felt most satisfied in storytelling."
- Soumya is with me.
- I am Soumya Srinivasan.
I am a psychologist.
"When I work, with children and older people, I try to awaken the Navrasas in human beings through stories and discuss it with them."
Healing and transformative storytelling' is my goal.
My name is Aparna Jaishankar.
"I have had the good fortune of growing up with my maternal grandparents and paternal grandmother in different parts of the country, so stories from Ramayana, Puranas, Geeta every night, were an inheritance."
"And then, there is this organization like Bangalore Storytelling Society, so I had to be a storyteller."
My fellow Lavanya Prasad is with me.
In my special project called ‘Roots’ where I help them document their life stories for their families.
Prime Minister: - Lavanya ji many congratulations to you.
"And as you said, once in Mann Ki Baat I too had asked you all that if you have grandfather-grandmother, maternal grandfather-grandmother in your family, ask them of stories of their childhood and tape them, record them, it will be very useful, I had said."
"But I felt good that the way all of you introduced yourself.... even in that... your art, your communication skills and in very few words, in a very good way you introduced yourself, for that too I congratulate you."
Prime Minister: - Now our audience of Mann Ki Baat... they too must be wanting to hear a story.
May I request you to narrate a story or two?
"For sure, this is our good fortune."
"Come, let us hear the story of a king. The name of the king was Krishna Deva Rai and the name of the kingdom was Vijayanagar."
This king of ours had many qualities.
"If at all there was any weakness, it was his excessive fondness for his minister Tenali Rama and secondly for food."
"Every day the king would sit for lunch with great hope that today something good must have been cooked and everyday his cook would serve the same insipid vegetables-ridge gourd, bottle gourd, pumpkin, apple gourd."
"One such day, the king while eating, threw away the plate in anger and ordered the cook to make some tasty vegetable the day after or else he would hang him."
What a dish!
Neither tasteless like ridge gourd nor sweet like pumpkin.
"Lord, just like you this too is the king of vegetables and that is why the rest of the vegetables have adorned it with a crown.” The king was pleased and declared that from today he would eat only this crown crested brinjal."
"“And not only myself, in my kingdom too, only brinjal will be cooked and no other vegetable will be cooked.” Both, the king and the subjects were pleased."
"Initially, all were happy as they got a new vegetable, but as days passed by the excitement began going down."
"Mashed brinjal in one house, then fried brinjal in the other."
Sambhar with brinjal at one place and brinjal with rice at the other.
How many forms could the poor brinjal alone have?
Thank you.
Thank you sir.
We heard these sisters who carry forward the unending stream of our traditions through the medium of storytelling.
"When I was talking to them on the phone, it was such a lengthy conversation and then I felt that there is a time limit for 'Mann Ki Baat', so I‘ve decided to upload all the things that we spoke about on my NarendraModiApp–you can definitely listen the entire stories on the app."
"In this 'Mann Ki Baat', I have presented for you only a tiny excerpt!"
"I would definitely urge you to take out sometime in the family every week for stories, and you can also allot every family member, for a given week, a topic, like, say compassion, sensitivity, valour, sacrifice, bravery – choose any one sentiment to be dwelt upon by all members of the family, that week and everybody will source out a story on the same subject and all of the family members in a group will tell individual tales!"
"You will see, what a huge treasure will get accrued in the family, how great research work will get carried out and how much delight it will bring to everyone!"
"And a new life, a new energy will be generated in the family - in the same way we can carry out another task."
"I urge all storytellers that soon we are going to celebrate 75 years of independence, can we propagate in our stories as many inspiring events as there were during the entire period of our enslavement!"
"Especially, from 1857 to 1947, we can introduce every major or minor incident of this period to our new generation through stories."
I am sure that you folks will definitely do this work.
"May this art of storytelling become stronger in the country, become more popularized and easier to imbibe- This is something we must all strive for!"
"My dear countrymen, come, let us now travel across the seven seas from the world of stories, listen to this voice!"
"I am from Mali, a country in West Africa."
"I had the opportunity to attend Kumbh Mela, the largest religious festival in India, in February."
It is a matter of great pride for me.
I felt good on being a part of Kumbh Mela and got to learn a lot about the culture of India by observing.
"I request that we be given the opportunity to visit India, once again so that we can learn more about India."
So this was Sedu Dembele from Mali.
"Mali is a large and land locked country in West Africa, far from India."
"Sedu Dembele, is a teacher in a public school in Kita, a town in Mali, and teaches English, Music, Painting, and drawing."
"But he also has another identity - people call him Hindustani’s Babu, and, he takes great pride in being called so."
"Every Sunday afternoon, he presents an hour long radio program in Mali entitled ‘Indian frequency on Bollywood songs!’ He has been presenting it for the last 23 years."
"During the course of this program, he renders his commentary in French as well as in Mali's lingua franca known as Bombara, and does it in quite a dramatic fashion."
He has deep seated love for India.
"Another reason for his profound association with India is that, he was also born on 15thAugust."
"Seduji has started another two-hour program now at 9 pm every Sunday, in which he narrates the story of an entire Bollywood film in French and Bombara."
"Sometimes while relating to an emotional scene, he, along with his listeners, cry together!"
Seduji's father had introduced him to Indian culture.
His father worked in a cinema theatre where Indian films were also exhibited.
"On this 15th August, through a video in Hindi, he greeted the people of India on Independence Day."
"Today, his children sing the national anthem of India with great ease!"
You must watch both of these videos and feel their love for India.
"When Seduji visited Kumbh and at that time he was part of the delegation that I met, his passion for India, affection and love are indeed a matter of pride for all of us."
"My dear countrymen, it is said here that the one who is rooted to the ground, is equally firm during the course of the biggest of storms."
"In this difficult period of Corona, our agricultural sector, our farmers are a living testimony to this."
"Even in this time of crisis, the agricultural sector of our country has again shown its resilience."
"Friends, the agricultural sector of the country, our farmers, our villages are the very basis of Atmanirbhar Bharat, a self reliant India."
If they remain strong then the foundation of Atmanirbhar Bharat will remain strong.
"In the recent past, these areas have liberated themselves from many restrictions and tried to break free from many myths."
"I get many such letters from farmers, I’ve had a dialogue with farmer organizations, who inform me about new dimensions being added to the farming sector and the changes it is undergoing."
"One such of our farmer brother lives in Sonipat district of Haryana, his name is Shri Kanwar Chauhan."
"He told us how there was a time when he used to face great difficulties in marketing his fruits and vegetables outside the mandi, the market place."
"If he used to sell his fruits and vegetables outside the mandi, then, many a times his produce and carts would get confiscated."
"But, in 2014, fruits and vegetables were excluded from the APMC Act, which, greatly benefited him and fellow farmers in the neighborhood."
"Four years ago, he, along with fellow farmers of his village, formed a Farmer Producer’s Organization."
Today farmers in the village cultivate sweet corn and baby corn.
"Their produce is being supplied directly to Azadpur Mandi, Delhi, Big Retail Chains and Five Star Hotels."
"Today, the farmers of the village are earning rupees two and a half to three lakhs per acre annually by cultivating sweet corn and baby corn."
"Not only this, more than 60 farmers of this village, through construction of net house and poly house are producing various varieties of tomato, cucumber and capsicum and earning from 10 to 12 lakh rupees per acre every year."
Do you know what is different with these farmers?
"They have the power to sell their fruits and vegetables, anywhere and to anyone! And this power is the foundation of their progress."
Now this power has also been imparted to other farmers of the country.
"Friends, about three or four years ago fruits and vegetables were excluded from the purview of APMC in Maharashtra."
An example of how this reform changed the state of farmers growing fruits and vegetables in Maharashtra is provided by Sri Swami Samarth Farm Producer Company limited - a Farmer Producer’s Organization.
Farmers in Pune and Mumbai are themselves running weekly markets.
"In these markets, the produce of about four and a half thousand farmers, of nearly 70 villages, is sold directly without any middleman!"
The rural youth are directly involved in the process of farming and selling to this market.
This directly benefits the farmers and the youth of the village are gainfully employed.
"""Another example is from then district of Tamil Nadu, here the Tamil Nadu Banana farmer produce company, This Farmer Produce Company is a company just in name, in reality, these farmers together have formed a collective."""
"This Farmer Collective purchased hundreds of metric tons of vegetables, fruits and Bananas from nearby villages during the lockdown, and supplied a vegetable combo kit to the city of Chennai."
"You just think, how many youth did they employed, and the interesting fact is that, due to absence of middlemen, not only the farmer profited but the consumer also benefited."
One such group of farmers hails from Lucknow.
"Friends, Ismail Bhai is a farmer in Rampura village of Banaskantha in Gujarat."
His story is also very interesting.
"Ismail Bhai wanted to do farming, but, now, as is these general attitude towards farming, his family raised eyebrows on the thoughts of Ismail Bhai!"
"Ismail Bhai’s father was into farming, but in that, he often incurred losses."
"Hence the father dissuaded...yet despite family members discouraging, Ismail Bhai decided that he would certainly take up farming."
Ismail Bhai had resolved that he would dispel the notion of farming being a loss making activity and change the situation as well.
"He started farming, albeit using new methods and innovative techniques."
Using drip irrigation he cultivated potatoes.... and today his potatoes are his hallmark.
He is growing potatoes that are of very high quality.
"Ismail Bhai directly sells these potatoes to large companies, the middle men are just out of the question. And the result - he is earning handsome profits."
He now has repaid all the debts of his father. And do you know the most significant fact?
"Today, Ismail Bhai is helping hundreds of farmers in his region."
He is changing their lives too.
"Friends, in present-times, the more modern alternatives we offer for agriculture, the more it will progress with newer innovations and techniques."
Bijay Shanti of Manipur is in the news for her new innovation. She launched a start-up to develop thread from the Lotus stem.
"Today, her efforts and innovations have opened new avenues in the fields of lotus farming and textile."
"My dear countrymen, I want to transport you to a period from our past."
It is a tale of 101 years ago.
The year was 1919.
The British rulers had slaughtered innocent civilians at Jallianwala Bagh.
"Post the massacre, a 12 year old boy visited the spot."
A happy and agile boy but what he saw at Jallianwala Bagh was beyond his imagination.
He was left stunned at how one could be so merciless.
This innocent boy had started to burn in the fire of anger.
"At Jallianwala Bagh, he took a vow to fight the British rule."
Did you come to know who am I referring to?
"Tomorrow, the 28th of September, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shahid Veer Bhagat Singh."
"I join my fellow countrymen in bowing before the paragon of courage and bravery, Shaheed Veer Bhagat Singh."
"Shaheed Bhagat Singh was as much a fighter as he was a scholar, a thinker."
"Bhagat Singh along with his revolutionary friends, without caring for their own selves, carried out such daring acts, which had a huge bearing in the country attaining Freedom."
"Be it his devotion towards Lala Lajpat Rai or his camaraderie with fellow revolutionaries as Chandra Shekhar Azad, Sukhdev, Rajguru amongst others, personal accolades were of no importance to him."
He had a single mission for as long as he lived and he sacrificed his life for that mission - That mission was to free India of injustice and the British rule.
I read a comment by Ajay SG from Hyderabad on the NaMo app.
Ajay ji writes - How can today's youth strive to be like Bhagat Singh?
"""Well see, We may or may not be able to become like Bhagat Singh, but the love Bhagat Singh had for his country, the drive and motivation he had to do something for his country certainly resides in all our hearts."""
That would be our biggest tribute to Shahid Bhagat Singh.
"Four years ago, around this time, the world witnessed the courage, bravery and valiance of our soldiers during the Surgical Strike."
"Our brave soldiers had just one mission and one goal - To protect at all costs, the glory and honour of Mother India."
They did not care a bit for their own selves.
They marched forward on their path of duty and we all witnessed how they came out victorious.
They enhanced Mother India’s pride.
"My dear countrymen, in the coming days, we countrymen will remember many great personalities who have made an indelible contribution in the making of India."
2nd of October is an auspicious and inspirational day for all of us.
"This day, we remember two great sons of Ma Bharati - Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri."
"Revered Bapu’s thoughts and ideals are more relevant now than earlier. The economic principles of Mahatma Gandhi, if we would have been able to understand their spirit, grasp it and practically implement them, then the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan would not have been needed today."
Gandhiji’s economic vision understood the pulse of the country and had the fragrance of India in them.
Revered Bapu’s life reminds us to ensure that all our actions should be such that it leads to the well being of the poor and deprived.
"Likewise, Shastriji’s life imparts to us the message of humility and simplicity."
11th of October is also a special day for us.
"This day, we remember Bharat Ratna Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan ji on his birth anniversary."
JP played a pioneering role in safeguarding our Democratic values.
"We also remember Bharat Ratna Nanaji Deshmukh, whose birth anniversary is also on the 11th Nanaji Deshmukh was a close companion of Jayaprakash Narayan ji."
"When JP was fighting the crusade against corruption, a potentially fatal attack was carried out on him in Patna."
"It was Nanaji Deshmukh then, who took the blow onto himself."
Nanaji Deshmukh was grievously injured in this attack but he managed to successfully save the life of JP.
This 12th of October is the birth anniversary of Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia ji too - She had dedicated her entire life in the service of the people.
"She was from a royal family and had no dearth of wealth, power and other resources."
"Even then, she spent her whole life in public service, just like a mother would with the same devotion with Vatsalya Bhava."
She had a very generous heart.
"This October 12th will mark the conclusion of her birth centenary year celebrations and today when I speak about Rajmata ji, I am reminded of an emotional incident."
"I have had the opportunity to have worked with her for many years, there are many incidents to recall."
"However, I feel like sharing one particular incident."
"We were on the ‘Ekta Yatra’, spanning Kanyakumari to Kashmir."
The yatra was moving under the leadership of Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi ji.
"It was harsh winters, months of December-January."
"Past midnight, around 12 or 1, we reached Shivpuri, near Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh. At the place where we would stay, since we would all be tired from the day’s travels, we would freshen up and sleep and prepare for the morning as well."
"It was around 2, when I, after having showered and freshened up was preparing to sleep, when I heard a knock on the door."
I opened the door and it was Rajmata Sahab who was standing in front of me.
"I was astounded to see Rajmata Sahab, that too on such a cold winter night."
"I offered my pranaam and said - ‘Mother, you at this midnight hour?’"
She had herself brought turmeric milk.
"However, when I looked to the other side, it was not just me! The entire travelling establishment of the Yatra, around 30-40 people including our drivers and other workers….She visited each room and herself ensured that all of us had milk at 2 in the night!"
I can never forget this incident as it taught me about the love of a mother and motherly affections.
It is our good fortune that such great personalities have reared the soil of India with their sacrifice and their tapasya.
"Come, let us all strive together to build such an India, on which these great personalities would pride themselves."
Their dreams should be our motivation!
"My dear countrymen, in this Corona time-period, I would once again remind you - Always wear a mask and do not venture out without a face shield."
"‘Do Gaz ki doori’, social distancing will protect you and your family."
"These few rules are the weapons in our fight against Corona, a powerful resource to save the life of every citizen."
Namaskar!
"My dear countrymen, Namaskar!"
I want to share a good news with you all at the beginning of Mann ki Baat today.
Every Indian will be proud to know that a very oldidol of Devi Annapurna is returning to India from Canada.
This idol was stolen from a temple of Varanasi and smuggled out of the country around 100 years ago somewhere around 1913.
I express my gratitude to the Government of Canada and to all those for this large heartedness who made this propitious deed possible.
Mata Annapoorna has a very special relationship with Kashi.
Now the coming back of her Idol is pleasing for all of us.
"Just like the idol of Mata Annapurna, a lot of our invaluable heritage has suffered at the handsof International gangs."
These gangs sell them at a very high pricein the international market.
"""Now not only are they being subjected to heavy restrictions. India has also increased her efforts for their return."""
"Because of such efforts, India has been successfulin bringing back lots of such idols and artifacts in the past few years.There is a coincidenceattached with the return of theidol of Mata Annapurna… World Heritage Week was celebrated only a few days ago."
World Heritage Week provides a wonderful opportunity to the lovers of culture to revisit the past and to know about thehistory of these important milestones.
"In spite of these times of corona, this time, we saw people celebrate this Heritage week in an innovative manner."
"Culture helps a lot during crisis, plays a major role in handling it."
"Even with the help of technology, culture works like an emotional recharge."
"Today, lots of museums and libraries in the country are working to make their collection fully digital."
"In Delhi, our National museum has made some commendable efforts in this respect."
"National museum is working on introducing around ten virtual galleries- isn’t this interesting! Now, sitting at your home, you can tour National Museum galleries of Delhi."
"On the one hand it is important to take cultural heritage to the maximum number of people through the medium of technology, the use of technology is also important for the conservation of this heritage."
Recently I was reading about an interesting project.
There is an island named Svalbard in the north of Norway.
"A project,Arctic World Archive has been setupon this island."
Invaluable heritage data has been stored in this archive in such a manner that no natural or manmade disaster can affect it.
"Just recently,we have received information that the heritage of Ajanta caves is also being digitized and preserved in this project."
A full view of the caves of Ajanta shall be on display in this.
"Along with the digitalized and restored painting, it shall also have important documents and quotes related to it."
"""Friends, the pandemic has on the one hand changed our ways of working on the other it has provided us with an opportunity to experience nature in a new manner."""
Our perspective in observing nature has also undergone a change.
We are now stepping into the winter season.
We will get to see myriad hues of nature.
For the past few days Internet is full of viral pictures of Cherry Blossoms.
You might be thinking that when I am referring to Cherry Blossoms I am talking about Japan’s distinct identity but it’s not like that.
These are not pictures of Japan.
These are pictures of Shillong of our Meghalaya.
These cherry blossoms have further enhanced the beauty of Meghalaya.
"Friends, this twelfth of November marked the commencement of the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Dr. Salim Ali ji."
Dr. Salim has done illustrious work in the field of bird watching – the avian world.
This has also attracted bird watchers of the world towards India.
I have always been an ardent admirer of people who are fond of bird watching.
"""With utmost patience, for hours together from morn to dusk, they can do bird watching, enjoying the scenic beauty of nature, they also keep passing on the knowledge gained to us."""
"In India too, many bird watching societies are active."
You too should connect yourselves with this subject.
"Amid the hectic routine of my life, recently in Kevadia, I alsogot a memorable opportunity to spend time with birds."
"Time spent among birds will bond you closer to nature, it will also inspire you towards the environment."
"My dear countrymen, India’s culture and Shaastras, knowledge has always been a centre of attraction for the entire world."
"Many people came to India to discover & study them & stayed back for ever, whereas some of them returned to their respective countries as carriers of this culture."
"I got an opportunity to know about the work of Jonas Masetti, also known as Vishwanath."
Jonas teaches Vedanta & Geeta to people in Brazil.
"He runs an institution named Vishwavidya, situated in the hills of Petropolis, an hour’s distance from Rio De Janeiro."
"Jonas, after studying Mechanical Engineering worked in his stock market company."
"Later he was drawn towards Indian culture, especially Vedanta."
"From stocks to spirituality, it has truly been a long journey for him."
"Jonas studied Vedanta Philosophy in India, staying at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam in Coimbatore for four years."
Jonas has another specialty- he is using technology to propagate his message.
He regularly conducts online programmes.
He also does a daily podcast.
"During the last seven years, through his free open courses on Vedanta, Jonas has taught over a lakh & a half students."
Jonas is not only doing great work – he is doing it through a language understood by a large number of people.
People are much keen on knowing how this could be of help to them during these times of Corona & quarantine.
"Through the medium of Mann Ki Baat, I congratulate Jonas on his efforts & wish him well for his future endeavors."
"Friends, similarly, one piece of news might have caught your attention."
Newly elected MP in New Zealand Dr. Gaurav Sharma took the Oath of office in one of the ancient languages of the world – Sanskrit.
The dissemination of Indian culture on part of an Indian fills us with pride.
"Through the medium of Mann Ki Baat, I extend best wishes to Gaurav Sharma ji."
All of us wish he attains newer achievements in the service of the people of New Zealand.
"My dear countrymen, tomorrow on the 30th of November, we shall celebrate the 551st Prakash Parv, birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji."
"The world over, the influence of Guru Nanak Dev ji is distinctly visible."
"From Vancouver to Wellington, from Singapore to South Africa his messages are heard all around."
"It is mentioned in Guru Granth Sahib –“sevak ko seva bun aayee”, that is the work of a sevak, a servant is to serve."
In the past few years at many important junctures we had the opportunity to serve as a Sevak.
Guru Sahib awarded us the opportunity to serve.
"550th Prakash Parva of Guru Nanak Dev ji, 350th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Govind Singh ji, next year we will have 400th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Teg Bahadur ji too."
I feel that I have been specially blessed by Guru Sahib that he has associated me very closely with his work.
"Friends, do you know that there is a Gurudwara, Lakhpat Gurudwara Sahib, in Kutch.Shri Guru Nanak ji had stayed at Lakhpat Gurudwara Sahib during his Udaasi, his spiritual travels."
During the 2001 earthquake this Gurudwara too faced damage.
It was the blessings of Guru Sahib that I was able to ensure its restoration.
"""Not only was the renovation done its glory and grandeur were restored too."" All of us were bestowed with ample blessings of Guru Sahib."
The restoration efforts of Lakhpat Gurudwara were honored with the Award of Distinction by the UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Award in 2004.
"The jury that gave away the award found that during the restoration, the fine details of the art and architecture were given special care."
"""The jury also noted that in the restoration of the Gurudwara not only did the Sikh community participate actively it was done under their guidance too."""
I had the good fortune of visiting Lakhpat Gurudwara when I was not even the Chief Minister.
I used to feel immensely energized being there.
Everyone feels blessed on visiting this Gurudwara.
I feel very grateful that Guru Sahib has granted me the opportunity to serve regularly.
Opening of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor in November last year was historic.
I will cherish this lifelong in my heart.
It is the good fortune of all of us that we got the opportunity to serve Shri Darbaar Sahib once more.
It has now become easier for our Sikh brothers and sisters abroad to send contributions in the service of Darbaar Sahib.
"With this step, the Sangat, the followers all over the world have come closer to Darbaar Sahib."
"Friends , it was Guru Nanak Dev ji who started the tradition of Langar and we saw how the Sikh community all over the world continued the tradition of feeding people during this period of Corona , served humanity – this tradition always keeps inspiring us."
I wish we all keep working as a Sevak.
May Guru Sahib keep taking services from me and countrymen in the same manner.
"Once again, many best wishes on Guru Nanak Jayanti."
"My dear countrymen, in the past few days I had the opportunity to interact with students of several universities across the country and be a part of important events in their journey of education."
"Through technology I was able to connect with students of IIT- Guwahati, IIT-Delhi, Deendayal Petroleum University of Gandhinagar, JNU of Delhi, Mysore University and Lucknow University."
To be amongst the youth of the country is extremely refreshing and energizing.
University campuses in a way are like Mini India.
"""In these campuses on the one hand we see the diversity of India on the other we also find great passion for changes for a New India."""
"Before Corona when I used to go for a face to face event at any institution, I would urge that poor students from nearby schools to be invited to the function."
Those children have been attending the functions as my special guests.
"When a small child in the grand function watches a young person becoming a Doctor, Engineer, Scientist, sees someone receiving a medal, new dreams awaken in the child- ‘I too can do it’, this self confidence arises."
There is inspiration for resolve.
"Friends, besides this, I am always interested in knowing who the alumni of the institution are, what the arrangements by the institution for regular engagement with its alumni are,how vibrant their alumni network is."
"My young friends, you are a student of an institution only till you study there, but you remain an alumni of that institution lifelong."
"After leaving school or college, two things never end - one, the influence of your education, and second, your bonding with your school or college."
"Whenever alumni interact with each other, in their memories of school or college, greater time is given to reminiscing about time on campus and moments spent with friends than about books and studies, and, from these memories, a feeling is bornto do something for the institution."
What can bring greater happiness than to lend a hand in development of the place where your personality was moulded?
"I have read certain such efforts, where the former students have given back to their old institutions in great measure."
"Nowadays, alumni are very active in this."
"IITians have provided their institutions many facilities like Conference Centres, Management Centres& Incubation Centres set up by their efforts."
All of these endeavors improve the learning experience of the current students.
"IIT Delhi has initiated an endowment fund, which is a brilliant idea."
"There is a culture of such endowments inrenowned universities across the world, which helps the students."
I think that universities of India are also capable to institutionalize this culture.
"When it comes to returning something, nothing can be deemed big or small."
Even the smallest help matters.
Every effort is important.
"Often, alumni play a very important role in technology upgradation of their institutions, in construction of buildings, in initiating awards and scholarships and in starting programs for skill development."
The old student associations of certain schools have started mentorship programmes.
"In these programmes, they guide the students of different batches and also discuss educational prospects."
"Alumni associations are robust in many schools, especially in boarding schools, where they organize activities like sports tournaments and community service."
"I would like to urge former students to keep consolidating their bonding with the institution in which they have studied!Whether it is at the level of school, college, or university."
I also urge the institutions to work on new and innovative ways of alumni engagement and develop creative platforms so that alumni can be actively involved.
A strong vibrant & active alumni network is needed not only in big Colleges and Universities but also in schools of our villages.
"My dear countrymen, the 5thDecember is the death anniversary of Sri Aurobindo."
"The more we read Sri Aurobindo, greater is the insight that we get."
"The more my young friends learn about SriAurobindo, greater will they learn about themselves, enriching themselves."
"""The state of inner consciousness in which you are, where you are engaged in trying to achieve the many resolves, amid all this you will always find a new inspiration in Sri Aurobindo you will find him showing you a new path!Just as at present when we are moving forward with the campaign 'Vocal for Local', Sri Aurobindo's philosophy of Swadeshi shows us the path."""
There is a very profound poemin Bangla.
‘Sui ChhutoPoy-Monto Ashe Tunga hote’.
"Diya-ShalaiKathi, Tau aasepote || Pro-deeptiJaliteKhete, Shutee, Jethe."
"KichhuteLokNoyaShadhiaan || That is, here, even the sewing needle and match stick come on a foreign ship!"
"The people are not free even in eating, drinking, sleeping!"
He alsoused to say that Swadeshi means that we give priority to the things made by our Indian workers and artisans.
It is not that Sri Aurobindo ever opposed learning anything from abroad.
"Wherever there is anything new, we should learn from there and then support and encourage what can be good for our country-and that is the spirit of the Vocal for Local Mantra in the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign."
Especially what Shri Aurobindo opined about adopting Swadeshi should be read by every citizen today.
"Friends, likewise, Shri Aurobindo's views on education were very lucid."
"He did not consider education to be limited only to bookish knowledge, degree and job."
"Sri Aurobindo used to say that our national education should focus on training of the hearts and minds of our younger generation, that is, scientific development of the mind and Indian ethos residein the heart should also be there, then only a young person can become a better citizen of the country."
"Whatever Shri Aurobindosaid about national education and expected then, the country is now achieving it through the new National Education Policy."
"My dear countrymen, new dimensions are being added to agriculture and its related activities in India."
The agricultural reforms in the past few days have also now opened new doors of possibilities for our farmers.
"The demands that have been made by farmers for years, that every political party, at some point or the other made the promise to fulfill, those demands have been met."
"After a lot of deliberation, the Parliament of India gave a legal formto the agricultural reforms."
These reforms have not only served to unshackle our farmers but also given them new rights and opportunities.
"In just a short span of time, these new rights have begun to ameliorate the woes of our farmers."
"You too should know how Jitendra Bhoiji, a farmer from Dhule district in Maharashtra made use of the recently promulgated farm laws."
Jitendra Bhoiji had sown corn and decided to sell his produce to traders for a right price.
The total cost of the produce was fixed at approximately Rupees Three Lakh thirty two thousand.
Jitendra Bhoi even received an advance of Rupees twenty five thousand.
It had been decided that the outstanding amount would be cleared in fifteen days.
"However, later such circumstances developed, that he did not receive the remainder of his payment."
"""Buy the crop from the farmer, keep the payment pending for months on end probably this was the long standing tradition that the buyers of corn were following."""
This continued for four months wherein Jitendra ji was not paid his dues.
"In this situation, the new farm laws that were passed in September came to his aid."
"Under this law, it was decided that all dues of the farmers should be cleared within three days of procurement, failing which, the farmer can lodge a complaint."
Another notable aspect of this law is that the area Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) has to ensure grievance redressal of the farmer within one month.
"""Now, with our farmer brother empowered with this law, his grievance had to be redressed consequently, he lodged a complaint and within days his outstanding payments were cleared."""
This correct and complete knowledge of the law became the strength of Jitendra ji.
"Whichever the field, correct knowledge, free from misconceptions and rumors can act as a force multiplier for every individual."
Mohammad Aslam ji from Baran district in Rajasthan is working in a similar fashion to increase awareness among farmers.
He is also the CEO of a farmer producer organization.
"Yes, you heard it right!"
- the CEO of a farmer producer organization.I hope this is heartwarming news for the CEOs of major companies - that farmers from far flung areas of the country are now also becoming CEOs of farmerorganizations!
"Friends, Mohammad Aslam Ji has made a Whatsapp group comprising several farmers from his area."
On this groupeveryday he shares updates with the farmers on prevalent prices at neighboring Mandis in the area.
"His own FPO also buys produce from farmers, hence, this effort of his also helpsfarmers in taking a decision."
"Friends, awareness beget spiritedness."
"Shri Virendra Yadav ji is one such farmer entrepreneur, who has influenced the lives of thousands through his awareness."
"Sometime ago, Virendra Yadav ji used to live in Australia."
"Two years ago, he came to India and now lives in Kaithal, Haryana."
"Just like others, the stubble in the fields was a big concern for him too."
"Work is being done on a massive scale to find the solution to this issue, however, today in Mann Ki Baat, I am especially mentioning Virendra ji because his efforts are different and show a new way forward."
"To find a solution to stubble, Virendra ji bought a Straw Baler machine to make bundles of straw."
"For this, he also received financial assistance from the Agricultural department."
"With this machine, he began to make bundles of stubble."
"After having made the bundles, he sold the stubble to agro energy plants and paper mills."
"You will be amazed to know that in just two years, Virendra ji has traded in stubble in excess of Rupees Two and a Half Crores and has earned a profit of approximately Rupees Fifty Lakhs."
The benefit of thisalso accrues to the farmers of those fields from where Virendra ji sources his stubble.
"We have often heard of ‘waste to wealth’, however, this initiative is a unique example of earning money and righteous goodwill while finding a solution to the problem of stubble."
"To the youth, especially the lakhs of students who are studying agriculture, it is my request that they visit villages in their vicinity and talk to the farmers and make them aware about innovations in farming and the recent agricultural reforms."
"This way, you will become stakeholders in major reforms underway in the country."
"My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we refer to a wide range of issues and topics."
"However, it has been one year of one such incidentwe would never want to remember fondly."
It has been roughly one year since the world came to know of the first case of Corona.
"Since then, the entire world has seen several ups and downs."
"Coming out of the lockdown now the discussion on a vaccine has commenced, however, any sort of negligence regarding Corona can be deadly even now."
We have to firmly keep fighting against Corona.
"Friends, Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s Punya Tithi, death anniversary is in a few days from now on the 6th of December."
"Besides paying our homage to Baba Saheb, this day is also an occasion to reaffirm our resolve to the country and abiding by the duties, assigned to us by the Constitution as an individual."
A large part of the country is also witnessing the onset of winter.
Many areas are experiencing snowfall.
"In this weather, we must take care of the children and elders in the family, especially the ailing and take precautions ourselves too."
"""It gives me joy to see people assisting the needy around them helping them with warm clothing."
Our young generation takes active part in such initiatives.
"Friends, the next time when we meet in Mann Ki Baat, the year 2020 will be drawing to a close."
"With new hopes and faith, we will move forward."
"Whatever suggestions or ideas you may have now, do continue to keep sharing with me."
My best wishes to all of you.
"May all of you stay healthy, stay active for the country."
Many Many thanks.
"My dear countrymen, Namaskar."
"You are aware that for an important programme, I have to leave for America…hence I thought it would be apt to record Mann Ki Baat, prior to my departure to America."
"""Routinely, we do remember a lot of days, we even celebrate myriad Days…and if you ask young sons-daughters at home, they are likely to furnish out an entire list of Days of the year with their chronological relevance!"""
"""But, there is one more day that all of us must remember, this day is one that is immensely congruent to the traditions of India."""
It’s one that connects us with our traditions that we have been following for centuries.
"It has been articulated here – Pibanti Naddhah, Swayameva Naambha…meaning that rivers do not drink their own water…they give it away altruistically."
"""For us, rivers are not mere physical entities, for us a river is a living unit…and that is exactly why we refer to rivers as Mother!"""
"All of you are aware – with the advent of the month of Magh, in our country, a lot of people perform Kalpvaas on the banks of mother Ganga or other rivers for an entire month."
"This tradition has ceased now…but in earlier times, it was customary to remember rivers while bathing at home. This tradition of remembering rivers may have gone extinct or exists sparsely…but there used to be a great tradition that would take one on a tour across the vastness of India while bathing early morning…a cerebral pilgrimage!"
It used to be a source of inspiration to connect with every nook and corner of the country.
"And of course, in India, it has been customary to chant a Shlok while bathing:Gange cha yamune chaiva Godavari saraswat at our homes, the elderly in the family would make children memorise the Shlok …this also led to germinating Aastha, faith towards rivers in our country."
It would inscribe an illustrated map of the great land of India on the psyche.
That used to establish an emotional connect with rivers.
"It would result in nurturing a harmonious credence towards the very river that embodied the Mother, sentimentally as well as visually…as a way of life too!"
"""It was a way to instill ‘Sanskaar’, the value system gamut.Friends, now that we are discussing the significance of rivers in our country, it is but natural for everyone to raise a question…one, in fact, has the right to do so…and answering that question is our responsibility too!"""
"Anyone can question – “you are singing so many songs dedicated to rivers, referring to a river as a Mother…then why is it that the river gets polluted?"
"Our scriptures distinctly disapprove of polluting rivers, even a bit!"
And our traditions have been synchronous with the thought.
"You know, of course, that the western region of our India, especially Gujarat and Rajasthan, suffer from scarcity of water."
"They face famines, many a time."
"Now that is why, a new tradition has developed in the social life there."
"For example, when it starts raining in Gujarat, Jal-Jeelani Ekadashi is celebrated there."
"This means, it is synonymous with what we term as ‘Catch the Rain’ in today’s times…accumulating each and every drop of water…Jal-jeelani."
"On similar lines, after the rains, in Bihar and other regions of the East, the great festival of Chhatth is celebrated."
"I hope that keeping the Chatth Pooja in mind, preparations for cleaning and repairing riverbanks and Ghats would have commenced."
We can very well undertake the endeavour of cleaning rivers and freeing them of pollution with collective effort and support.
"""The Namami Gange Mission too is making advances today…collective efforts of all, in a way, mass awareness,a mass movement has a major role to play in that."
"When Namami Gange is being referred to, one thing is certain to draw your attention…especially that of the youth."
"These days, a special E-auction is being held."
This electronic auction pertains to gifts presented to me by people from time to time.
The money that accrues through this E-auction is dedicated solely to the Namami Gange Campaign.
"The affectionate, warm spirit, with which you present me gifts …that very sentiment gets bolstered through this campaign."
"""Friends, in order to rejuvenate rivers throughout the country, in order to cleanse waters, the government and social service organizations keep undertaking one endeavour or the other."""
"""And this is not about the present day, it is going on for decades now."""
There are some people who have dedicated themselves to these causes.
"And it is this very tradition, this very endeavour, this very faith that has saved our rivers."
"Whenever such news come to my notice, from any corner of India, it evokes immense respect in my heart for people who embark upon such tasks…and I also feel like sharing that with you."
"Take a look at Vellore and Thiruvannamalai districts of Tamilnadu, whose example I wish to cite."
A river named Naagnadi flows there.
"Years ago, the Naagnadi had all dried up."
"Because of that, the water level there had terribly gone down."
"But, the womenfolk there took up the cudgels to rejuvenate their river."
"And then…lo and behold – they got people connected, dug up canals through public participation, constructed check dams and recharge-wells."
"Friends, you too would be glad to know that today, the river is brimming with water."
"And truly, when a river is full of water, it lends such tranquility to the mind…I have actually, witnessed the experience… Many of you might be aware that on the very banks of river Sabarmati, Mahatma Gandhi set up the Sabarmati Ashram…during the last few decades, the river had dried up."
"6 to 8 months a year, no water was even visible there. But river Narmada and river Sabarmati were linked…today, if you go to Ahmedabad, the waters of river Sabarmati fill one’s heart with such joy!"
"Similarly, our sisters from Tamilnadu are undertaking myriad such tasks…many such tasks are being done in various corners of the country."
"I know for sure that many of our saints, our gurus associated with our religious traditions are doing a lot for the sake of water and rivers, along with their spiritual pursuits…many of them are running campaigns to plant trees along riverbanks…at places, dirty water is being prevented from flowing into rivers.Friends, when we are celebrating ‘World River Day’ today, I praise and greet all dedicated to this work."
"""But to all people living near every river, to countrymen I will urge that in India in all corners at least once in a year a river festival must be celebrated."""
"My dear countrymen, never make the mistake of treating minor issues, little things as small."
"Through tiny efforts, at times, very significant changes occur, and if we look towards the life of Mahatma Gandhi ji we will find every moment how even small things had so much importance and how using small issues he accomplished big resolutions."
Our youth today must know how the campaign for cleanliness continuously gave energy to our freedom movement.
"Today after so many decades, the cleanliness movement has once again connected the country to the dream of a new India."
And this is also becoming a campaign to change our habits too and we must not forget that this cleanliness is a programme.
This cleanliness is a responsibility of the transition of sanskar from generation to generation and when the campaign for cleanliness continues generation after generation in the entire society cleanliness as a trait gets imbibed.
"""And that is why this is not a subject of a year or two, of one government or the other government."" Generation after generation, with alertness, continually, without being tired or stopping, with high reverence we have to remain associated with cleanliness and continue the campaign for cleanliness."
"""And I have said earlier too that this cleanliness is a great tribute by this country to revered Bapu and we have to keep paying this tribute every time, continuously."""
"Friends, people know that I don’t ever let go any chance to speak in connection with cleanliness and possibly that is why a listener of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, Shriman Ramesh Patel ji has written to me that learning from Bapu, in this “Amrit Mahotsav” of freedom, we should take the resolve of economic cleanliness too."
"""The way building of toilets enhanced the dignity of poor, similarly economic cleanliness ensures rights of the poor, eases their life."""
You are aware of the campaign that the country started regarding Jandhan accounts.
"Today,because of this the rightful money of the poor is getting credited directly into their accounts and because of this, obstacles like corruption have reduced very significantly."
It is true that technology can help a lot in economic cleanliness.
"It is matter of delight for us that even in villages, the common person is getting connected in the direction of digital transactions through fin-tech UPI… its prevalence has begun increasing."
"""I will tell you a figure which will make you proud, during last August, 355 crore UPI transactions took place in one month, that is more than nearly 350 crore transactions, that is, we can say that during the month of August UPI was used for digital transactionsmore than 350 crore times."""
"Today, on an average, digital payments of more than 2 lakh crore Rupees is happening through UPI."
"Through this the economy of the country is acquiring cleanliness and transparency, and we all know that now the importance of fin-tech is increasing a lot."
"""Friends, Bapu had connected cleanliness with independence, the same way he had made khadi the identity of freedom."""
"Today in the 75 th year of freedom when we are celebrating the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence, we can say with satisfaction today that our young generation today is giving khadi the place of pride that khadi had during freedom struggle."
Today the production of khadi and handloom has increased multiple times and its demand too has increased.
You too know that there were many such occasions when business of more than a crore rupees has been transacted in the khadi showroom in Delhi.
"I too would like to remind you again that on the 2nd of October, on revered Bapu’s birth anniversary, let us together aim for another new record."
"In your city wherever khadi is sold, handloom is sold, handicraft is sold and now that the festival of Diwali is there.., for the festive season, every khadi, handloom, cottage industry purchase of yours should strengthen the campaign for ‘Vocal for Local’, it should break all old records."
"Friends, in this period of Amrit Mahotsav, a campaign to disseminate to everyone the untold stories of the history of freedom is also going on… and for this, upcoming writers, youth of the country and the world were called upon."
For this more than 13 thousand people have registered till now and that too in 14 different languages.
And for me a thing of joy also is that non-resident Indians from more than 20 countries have expressed their wish to join this campaign.
There is another interesting information- more thannearly 5000 upcoming writers are searching out tales of struggle for freedom.
"They have taken the lead to write something on those who are unsung heroes, who are un-named, whose names don’t appear on the pages of history, on the theme of such unsung heroes, on their lives, on those events, that is the youth of the country have decided to bring forth the history of those freedom fighters who were not even discussed during the last 75 years."
"""I appeal to all the listeners, I appeal to all those connected with the field of education."""
You too motivate the youth.
You too come forward and it is my firm belief that during the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence the people who areworking for writing history will make history as well.
"My dear countrymen, we all know about the Siachen Glacier."
The cold there is so terrible that it is beyond capacity of a common person to live there.
"With snow spread far and wide, there is no sign of any vegetation anywhere."
The temperature here dips to even minus 60 degrees.
"A few days ago, the feat that a team of 8 Divyang persons performed in this inaccessible region of Siachen is a matter of pride for every countryman."
This team created a world record by hoisting its flag on the Kumar Post situated at an altitude of more than 15 thousand feet at the Siachen glacier.
"Despite the challenges of physical ability, the feats that these Divyangs have achieved are an inspiration for the whole country and when you get to know about the members of this team, you will also be filled with courage and enthusiasm, just like I was."
This operation to conquer the Siachen Glacier has been successful because of the veterans of the special forces of the Indian Army.
I commend the team for this historic and unprecedented achievement.
"It also shows the spirit of our countrymen to tackle every challenge with a “Can Do Culture”, a “Can Do Determination” and a “Can Do Attitude”."
"Friends, today many efforts are being made for the welfare of Divyangjan in the country."
"I got a chance to know about one such effort being made in Uttar Pradesh - “One Teacher, One Call”."
This unique effort in Bareilly is showing a new path to the Divyang children.
"This campaign is being led by the principal of a school in Dabhaura Gangapur, Deepmala Pandey ji."
"During the Corona period, due to this campaign, not only did the admission of a large number of children become possible, more than 350 teachers have also joined it with a spirit of service."
"These teachers go from village to village calling for Divyang children, looking out for them and then ensuring their admission in one school or the other."
I deeply appreciate this noble effort of Deepmala ji and her fellow teachers for the sake of Divyangjans.
Every such effort in the field of education is going to shape the future of our country.
"My dear countrymen, the condition of our lives today is such that the word Corona resonates in our ears many times a day… the biggest global pandemic in a hundred years, COVID-19 has taught every countryman a lot."
Today there has been an increase in curiosity and awareness about Healthcare and Wellness.
Traditionally natural products which are beneficial for wellness and health are available in abundance in our country.
"Patayat Sahu ji, who lives in Nandol, Kalahandi, Odisha, has been doing unique work in this area for years."
He has planted medicinal plants on one and a half acres of land.
Satish ji of Ranchi has shared another similar information to me through a letter.
Satish ji has drawn my attention to an Aloe Vera Village in Jharkhand.
The women of Deori village near Ranchi had undergone training in Aloe Vera cultivation from Birsa Agricultural School under the leadership of Manju Kachhap ji.
"After this they started cultivating aloe vera. ""Not only did this farming benefit in the field of health, the income of these women also increased."""
They had good income even during the Covid pandemic. One of the major reasons for this was that the companies making sanitizers were buying Aloe Vera directly from them.
Today a team of about forty women is involved in this work. And Aloe Vera is cultivated over many acres.
"Whether it is Patayat Sahu ji of Odisha or this team of women in Deori, the way they have linked agriculture with the field of health is an example in itself."
"Friends, the 2nd of October also marks the birth anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shastri ji."
"In his memory, this day also teaches us about those who attempt new experiments in agriculture."
"To promote start-ups in the field of medicinal plants, an Incubator by the name of Medi-Hub TBI is operational in Anand, Gujarat."
"In a very short time, this Incubator associated with medicinal and aromatic plants has supported the business idea of 15 entrepreneurs."
Sudha Chebrolu ji has launched her start-up only after getting the help of this Incubator.
Priority is given to women in this company and they are also responsible for innovative herbal formulations.
Another such entrepreneur is Subhashree ji who has also received help from this Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Incubator.
Subhashree ji's company is working in the field of herbal room and car fresheners.
She has also created a herbal terrace garden which has more than 400 medicinal herbs.
"Friends, the Ministry of Ayush has taken an interesting initiative to increase awareness about Medicinal and Herbal Plants among children and Professor Ayushman ji has taken the lead."
It is possible that you must be wondering who Professor Ayushman is!
Actually Professor Ayushman is the name of a comic book.
"In this, short stories have been prepared through different cartoon characters."
"Along with this, the usefulness of healthy medicinal plants like Aloe Vera, Tulsi, Amla, Giloy, Neem, Ashwagandha and Brahmi has been mentioned."
"Friends, in the current context, with the trend of people around the world regarding medicinal plants and herbal products increasing, India has immense potential."
"In the past, there has been a significant increase in the export of Ayurvedic and herbal products."
"I urge scientists, researchers and people associated with the start-up world to pay attention to such products, which not only increase the wellness and immunity of the people, but also help in increasing the income of our farmers and youth."
"Friends, moving beyond traditional farming, novel initiatives and options are being done in agriculture and are continuously creating new means of self-employment."
The story of two brothers from Pulwama is also an example of this.
"The way Bilal Ahmed Sheikh and Munir Ahmed Sheikh found new avenues for themselves in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, they are an example of New India.39 years old Bilal Ahmed ji is highly qualified, he has obtained many degrees."
He is now using his experience of higher education by launching his own start-up in agriculture.Bilal ji has installed a unit of Vermi composting at his home.
"""The bio-fertilizer prepared from this unit has not only benefited a lot in agriculture, it has also brought employment opportunities to the people."
Today 15 people are also working in this Vermicomposting unit.
"A large number of people are reaching to see this unit, and most of them are young people who want to do something in the agriculture sector."
"The Sheikh brothers of Pulwama took a pledge to become a job creator instead of a job seeker and today they are showing a new path not only to Jammu and Kashmir, but to the people across the country as well."
"My dear countrymen, the 25th of September is the birth anniversary of a great son of the country, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji."
"His economic philosophy, his policies aimed at empowering the society, the path of Antyodaya shown by him remain as relevant in the present context and are also inspirational."
"Three years ago, on his birth anniversary, the 25th of September, the world's largest health assurance scheme – Ayushman Bharat scheme was implemented."
"Today, more than two and a half crore impoverished people of the country have got free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh in the hospital under the Ayushman Bharat scheme."
Such a massive scheme for the poor is dedicated to the Antyodaya philosophy of Deen Dayal ji.
"If the youth of today inculcate values and ideals into their lives, it can be of great benefit to them."
"Once in Lucknow, Deen Dayal ji had said – “How many good things, good qualities there are – we derive all these from the society itself."
"That is, Deen Dayal ji taught us that we take so much from society, from the country, whatever it be, it is only because of the country, thus we should think about how we will repay our debt towards the country."""
This is a significant message for today's youth.
"Friends, from the life of Deen Dayal ji, we also get a lesson to never give up."
"Despite the adverse political and ideological circumstances, he never wavered from the vision of a Swadeshi, home grown model for the development of India."
Today many young people want to move ahead by breaking away from the oft-treaded paths.
They want to do things their own way.
Deen Dayal ji's life can teach them a lot.
That is why I urge our youngsters to definitely know about him.
"My dear countrymen, we touched upon many topics today."
"Like we were discussing, the time to come is of festivals."
The whole country is also going to celebrate the festival of the victory over untruth by Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram.
But during this festival we have to remember about one more fight - that is the country's fight against Corona.
Team India is making new records everyday in this fight.
"With regards to Vaccination, the country has made many such records which are being talked about the world over."
Every Indian has an important role in this fight.
"We have to get the vaccine administered when our turn comes, but we also have to take care that no one is left out of this circle of safety."
Those around you who have not got vaccinated also have to be taken to the vaccine center.
"Even after getting vaccinated, the necessary protocol has to be followed."
I hope that once again Team India will keep the flag flying high in this fight.
"Next time, we will discuss some more topics in ‘Mann Ki Baat’."
"Wishing you all, every countryman the best for the fortcoming festivals."
Thank You!
We are seeing how the country is fighting  against Covid-19 with all her might.
"This has been the biggest pandemic  in the last hundred years and during this very pandemic, India has  confronted many a natural disaster with fortitude."
"Meanwhile, there were  cyclone Amphan and cyclone Nisarg, many states had floods, there were  many minor and major earthquakes; there were landslides."
"Just recently,  in the past ten days, the country faced two major cyclones – cyclone  Taukte on the west coast and cyclone Yaas on the east coast."
Both these  cyclones affected a number of States.
"The country and her people fought  them with all their strength, ensuring minimum loss of life."
"We  experience now that compared to earlier times, we are being able to save  the lives of maximum people."
"Under these trying and extraordinary  calamitous circumstances, people of all these cyclone affected States  have displayed courage…they’ve faced this moment of crisis with immense  patience and discipline."
"I wish to commend all citizens respectfully,  wholeheartedly."
People who led rescue and relief work deserve more  appreciation than can be expressed.
I salute all of them.
"The Centre,  State governments and local administration have come together to face  this calamity."
My heart goes out to all the people who’ve lost their  near and dear ones.
Let us all firmly stand by those who have borne the  brunt of this disaster.
Her collective  strength and our spirit of service has always rescued the country from  the midst of every storm.
"We’ve seen in the days gone by how our  doctors, nurses and frontline warriors have toiled day and night without  bothering about themselves, and continue to do so."
"Amidst all this,  there indeed are people who’ve played a major role in the fight against  the second wave of Corona."
"Many listeners of Mann Ki Baat, on NamoApp  and through letters, have urged me to touch upon these warriors."
"Friends,  when the second wave came, the demand for oxygen surged all of a  sudden…this was a very big challenge…delivering medical oxygen to remote  parts of the country was indeed a huge task."
"If an oxygen tanker moves  fast, the slightest error can lead to the risk of a big explosion."
Many  plants manufacturing industrial oxygen are located in the eastern parts  of the country…transporting oxygen from there to other states of the  country requires many days.
"In confronting this challenge, the country  was helped by cryogenic tanker drivers, the Oxygen Express and Air Force  pilots, many such people worked on a war footing, saving the lives of  hundreds of thousands of people."
Joining us in Mann Ki Baat today is one  such friend 
"Modi ji – First of all, I’d want you to definitely tell us something about yourself."
"Dinesh ji – Sir, my name is Dinesh Babulnath Upadhyay."
"I am a resident of village Hasanpur, Post Jamua, District Jaunpur."
Modi ji – You are from U.P.!
"Dinesh ji – And Sir, I have a son, two daughters…also my wife and parents."
Modi ji – And what do you do?
"Dinesh ji – Sir, I drive an oxygen tanker for liquid oxygen."
Modi ji – Are the children carrying on well with their studies?
Dinesh ji – Yes Sir.
They are studying.
Both daughters as well as the son are studying Sir.
Modi ji – Are their online studies going on well?
"Dinesh  ji – Yes Sir, they are doing it well."
I’ve been driving an oxygen tanker for 15  – 17 years Sir.
"Modi ji – Okay,  you’ve been transporting oxygen for 15 – 17 years!"
Then you are not just  a truck driver!
"In a way, you are engaged in saving the lives of lakhs  of people."
"Dinesh ji – Sir, our line  of work is like that!"
"Sir, our Company of oxygen tankers, Inox Company  also takes good care of us."
"And wherever we deliver oxygen, it gives us a  lot of happiness."
"Modi ji – But during these Corona times, your responsibilities have increased a lot!"
"Dinesh ji – Yes Sir, it has increased a lot."
"Modi  ji – When you are on the driving seat of your truck, what thoughts  cross your mind?"
Any new experience compared to earlier times?
There  must be a lot of pressure.
"Concerns regarding the  family, the Corona atmosphere, pressures from people, demands!"
"Dinesh ji – Sir,  that doesn’t bother us."
"For us, it’s just that we are fulfilling our  duty…if delivering oxygen on time gives life to someone, it is a matter  of great honour for us."
Modi ji – You  are expressing your sentiment very well.
"Okay, tell us…today, during  these pandemic times when people are noticing the importance of your  work, which perhaps they didn’t realise earlier…has it led to a change  in the way they view you and your work?"
Dinesh  ji – Yes Sir.
"Earlier, oxygen drivers like us used to be caught up in  jams, somewhere or the other. But in present times, the administration  has helped us a lot."
"And wherever we go, we feel an inner eagerness  within…how soon can we reach and save people’s lives!"
"Modi ji – Okay, they indicate the V for victory!"
"Some show a V, others raise a thumbs up."
It gives us a  lot of satisfaction…we must have done a good deed in life to get an  opportunity to offer such service.
Modi ji – All your fatigue must be vanishing!
Dinesh ji – Yes…Yes Sir.
"Modi ji – So, do you come home and tell your children about that?"
Dinesh ji – No sir.
My children stay in the village.
I am here at Inox Air Products as a driver.I go home after 8-9 months.
"Modi ji – So, at times, you must be talking to the children on the phone!"
Regularly.
Modi ji – Then they must be feeling that their father should take care of himself amidst all this!
"Dinesh  ji – Sir, they say, “Papa, work…but do it with along with your own  safety.” And we work with safety."
We have a plant in Maangaon too.
Inox  helps us a lot.
Modi ji – Fine.
"Dinesh ji, I felt really nice listening to you."
And even the country  will get to know how people are working in this fight against Corona.
"For nine odd months, you are not meeting your children and family, just  to ensure that people’s lives are saved."
"When the country listens to  this, she will feel proud that we shall win the battle, since lakhs of  people like Dinesh Upadhyaya ji are persevering, leaving no stone  unturned!"
"Dinesh ji – Sir, one day or the other, we shall certainly defeat Corona!"
Modi  ji – Fine Dinesh ji…your sentiment is the strength of the country.
Many  thanks Dinesh ji.
And please convey my blessings to your children.
Dinesh ji – Shall do it Sir.
Modi ji – Thank you.
"Friends,  truly, as Dinesh ji was mentioning, when a tanker driver reaches a  hospital with oxygen, he comes across as a godsent messenger."
We can  understand the magnitude of responsibility involved in such work…and the  resultant mental pressure one undergoes.
"Friends,  at this very moment of challenge, to facilitate transportation of  oxygen, Indian Railway too has stepped forward."
"Oxygen Express, oxygen  rail has transported larger quantities of oxygen to all corners of the  country, faster than oxygen tankers travelling by road."
Mothers and  sisters would be proud to hear that one oxygen express is being run  fully by women.
Every woman of the country will feel proud at that.
"Not  just that, every Indian will feel proud."
"I have invited Shirisha Gajni, a  loco pilot of Oxygen Express, to Mann Ki Baat."
Modi ji- Shirisha ji namastey!
Shirisha- Namastey sir!
How are you?
Modi  ji- I am very fine.
"Shirisha ji, I have heard that you are working as a  railway pilot and I was told that your entire team of women is running  this oxygen express."
Shirisha ji you are doing a wonderful work.
During  corona times many women like you have come forward to give strength to  the country to fight corona.
You too are a very big example of woman  power.
"But the country would like to know, I want to know where do you  get this motivation from?"
"Shirisha-  Sir, for me my motivation are my father – mother, sir."
"My father is a  government employee, sir."
"Actually I have two elder sisters, sir."
"We are  three members, ladies only but my father encourages us to work."
My  first sister is doing a government job in bank and I am settled in  railways.
"Modi  ji- Ok Shirisha ji, you have served railways during normal days too."
You have driven trains routinely but on the one hand there was so much  demand for oxygen….you were ferrying oxygen… then it must have been a  task with much responsibility; being a bit more responsible.
"Ferrying  normal goods is a different matter, Oxygen is a very delicate thing too,  what experience did you undergo?"
Shirisha-  I felt happy in doing this work.
"During oxygen special time I observed  all – safety wise, formation wise and for any leakage."
"Next, Indian  Railway too is supportive, sir."
"I was given green path to drive this  oxygen, I reached 125 kilometres in one and a half hour with this train."
"Railway took this much responsibility, I also took responsibility, sir."
Modi  ji- Great… Shirisha ji I congratulate you a lot and convey my special  pranam to your father- mother who motivated their three daughters so  much and promoted them greatly and thus encouraged them.
And I feel…  pranam to such parents too and to you all sisters as well who served the  country like this and displayed such a spirit also.
Many many thanks  Shirisha ji.
Shirish- Thanks sir.
"Thank you, sir."
I need your blessings.
"Modi ji- May the blessings of All Mighty remain with you, blessings of mother-father be with you."
Thanks ji.
Shirisha- Thanks sir.
"Friends,  just now we heard Shirisha ji."
"Her experiences inspire us, make us  emotional too."
"In fact, this battle is so big… that in this like the  railways our country is working through all the three ways- water, land,  sky."
"On the one hand empty tankers are being flown to oxygen plants by  Air Force planes, on the other, work on construction of new oxygen  plants too is being completed."
"Along with that, oxygen, oxygen  concentrators and cryogenic tankers from abroad also are being brought  into the country."
"That is why, in this task Navy , Air Force, Army and  our institutions like DRDO are also involved."
"So many of our scientists,  industry experts and technicians too are working on a war footing."
The  countrymen are keen to know and to understand the work of all of them.
That is why Group Captain Patnaik ji from the Air Force is joining us.
Speaking from Air Force station Hindon.
"Modi  ji- Patnaik ji, during the war against corona you are handling a big  responsibility."
I would like to know as a soldier you have done a  different kind of work.
One has to run in warfare; today you are running  to save lives.
How are you feeling?
"Group  Captain- Sir we are fortunate to be able to help our countrymen at this  moment of crisis. And these missions that have been assigned to us we  are fulfilling them very well. Our training and support services that we  have are assisting us fully and the best thing, Sir, is that the job  satisfaction derived is of a very high level."
"Group  Captain- Sir, from the last one month we have been continuously lifting  oxygen tankers and liquid oxygen containers from both domestic and  international destinations, Sir. Sir, the Air force has completed more  than about 1600 sorties and we have flown more than 3000 hours."
My daughter Aditi too is with me Sir.
Modi ji- That is nice!
Aditi- I am 12 years old and I study in class 8th.
"Modi ji- So your father goes out, is in uniform!"
Aditi-Yes!
"Feel very proud that he is doing all this  important work, helping so many people suffering from corona and  bringing oxygen tankers and containers from so many countries."
"Modi ji- But the daughter does miss her father so much, doesn’t she?"
Now a days he is not able to stay home much as  he is going on so many international flights and delivering containers  and tankers to production plants so that the people suffering from  corona can get oxygen timely and their lives can be saved.
"Modi  ji - When your friend circle, your fellow students learn that your  father is engaged in oxygen service, they must be looking at you with  great respect?"
"Modi  ji –It is said here that when a daughter speaks, Goddess Saraswati is  very much present in her words and when Aditi is saying that we will  definitely win, then in a way it becomes the voice of God."
"Ok Aditi,  right now you must be studying online?"
"Aditi  - Yes, right now all our classes are going on online and right now we  are taking full precautions at home… and if one has to go out, then you  must wear a double mask and everything else…we are maintaining all  precautions and personal hygiene."
"Modi ji –Good beta, what are your hobbies?"
What do you like?
Aditi  - My hobbies are swimming and basketball but now that has stopped a bit  and during this lockdown and corona virus I have become very fond of  baking and cooking and I do all the baking and cooking for my dad so  when he returns after doing so much work then I make cookies and cakes  for him!
Modi ji –Wah!
It is really  nice!
"Alright Beta after a long time you have got a chance to spend some  time with your father, and it feels very good and I congratulate you  captain and when I congratulate the captain I mean not only him but all  our Forces-navy, army and air force, I salute everyone, the way they are  operating cohesively!"
Thank you brother.
"PM  Modi- Friends, the nation salutes these soldiers of ours, these  warriors of ours for the work that they have done."
"Similarly, millions  of people are toiling day and night."
The tasks they are performing is  not part of their routine work.
This type of disaster has hit the world  in a hundred years.
"We have met such a big calamity after a century,  therefore, no one had any experience of this kind of work."
"Behind it  lies the spirit of service for the country, and power of resolve."
This  is why the country has been able to do work that has never been done  before.
"You can guess for yourself, in normal circumstances we used to  produce 900 Metric Tonnes of liquid medical oxygen in a day."
"Now, it has  expanded to generating more than 10 times the normal output and  producing around 9500 Metric Tonnes per day."
Our warriors are  transporting this oxygen to far-flung corners of the country.
"My  dear countrymen, so many efforts were made in the country to distribute  and provide oxygen, so many people came together that as a citizen, all  these endeavors inspire you."
Everyone has done their duty as part of a  team.
"I have been told by Urmila ji from Bengaluru that her husband is a  lab technician, and how he has been continuously performing task of  testing in the midst of so many challenges."
"Friends,  at the beginning of Corona, there was only one testing lab in the  country, but today more than two and a half thousand labs are in  operation."
"Initially, only a few hundred tests could be conducted in a  day, now more than 20 lakh tests are being carried out in a single day."
"So far, more than 33 crore samples have been tested in the country."
This  huge task is made possible only because of our colleagues like those  mentioned.
"There are countless frontline workers engaged in the work of  sample collection, going amidst infected patients, and taking their  sample is an example of yeoman service."
"To protect themselves, these  friends have to wear PPE Kit continuously even in sweltering heat."
After  that the sample reaches the lab.
"Therefore, when I was reading your  suggestions and queries, I decided that these friends engaged in such  services should also be discussed."
We will also get to know a lot from  their experiences.
So now let's talk to our friend Prakash Kandpal ji  who works as a lab technician in Delhi.
"Modi ji - Prakash ji Namaskar Prakash Ji - Namaskar respected Prime Minister ji Modi  ji - Prakash ji, first of all tell about yourself to all of our  listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat'."
"How long have you been doing this work and  what has been your experience during the time of Corona, because the  people of the country neither get to see you on television nor appear in  newspapers, even then working and living in the lab like a sage!"
So I  would like that through your account the countrymen will also get  information about how work is going on in the country.
"Prakash  ji - I have been working as a lab technician for the last 10 years in  the hospital called Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, an  autonomus institution, under the Government of Delhi."
My experience in  health sector is of 22 years.
"Even before ILBS, I have worked in  prestigious institutions like Apollo Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer  Hospital, Rotary Blood Bank, Delhi."
"Sir, although in all of these  medical institutions I served in the blood bank department, but since  1st April, 2020 last year, I have been working in the Covid testing lab  under the Virology department of ILBS."
"Undoubtedly  during the Covid pandemic, there was a lot of strain on all the means  and resources related to health but I personally consider this phase of  cataclysm as an opportunity during which the nation, humanity, society  expects and hopes for display of all that more responsibility,  cooperation, strength and capability from us."
"Sometimes when our family members are apprehensive or  even a little scared, on such an occasion, I remind them that the  soldiers of our country on the borders who are always away from their  families protecting the country in dire and extraordinary circumstances,  compared to them whatever risk we undertake is less, is very less."
So  they too understand this thing and in a way they also cooperate with me  and they also contribute in whatever kind of cooperation there is during  the time of this calamity.
"Modi ji -  Prakash ji, on one hand the government is advocating everyone to keep a  distance –or maintain distance from each other during the Corona  pandemic."
And you have to be in the midst of the corona virus by being  at the forefront.
You have to encounter it from the front.
"So it is a  life-threatening affair in itself, and therefore it is very natural for  the family to be worried."
"But still, this lab technician's job is one of  the common professions."
"And in such a pandemic, another dimension gets  added to the work that you are doing."
You must be spending many an overnight in the lab.
"And  because so many crores of people are being tested, the burden must have  also increased."
"But for your own safety also, do you take precautions or  not?"
"Prakash ji –Yes Sir, we do."
"Our  ILBS lab is accredited by WHO, and thus all the protocols observed are  of international standards."
"We go to lab in it, and wearing it we work."
"And then there is a complete protocol of discarding the dress, another  for labelling and also for testing!"
"So  sir, it is God’s grace that my family and most of my acquaintances are  still untouched by this infection."
"And there is one thing that, if you  are careful and observe caution you can avoid it to an extent."
"Modi  ji - Prakash ji, thousands of people like you have been stationed in  the labs for the last one year and have been doing such arduous work"
"Prakash ji, through you I, thank all the members of your  fraternity."
I thank you wholeheartedly on behalf of the countrymen.
May you and your family stay healthy.
I wish you all  the best.
"Prakash Ji - Thank you, Prime Minister ji."
I am very grateful to you for giving me this opportunity.
Mr. Modi - Thank you brother.
"PM  Modi: Friends, I may have conversed with Bhai Prakash ji but in way,  through his words, the fragrance of service rendered by thousands of lab  technicians is reaching us."
In his words you not only get a glimpse of  the sense of service evident in thousands and lakhs of people but we  also come to realize our responsibility.
"The kind of hard work and  commitment that our friends like Bhai Prakash ji are putting in their  work, that very quantum of cooperation from them will greatly help in  defeating Corona."
"My dear countrymen,  while at present we were discussing our 'Corona Warrior."
But there also has been a very big role in this fight displayed  by many such warriors across the country.
"Think for yourself, our  country faced such a big crisis that it affected every system of the  country."
The agricultural sector protected itself from this attack to a  great extent.
"Not only did it keep itself safe, but the sector also  progressed, moving forward."
"Do you know that even in this pandemic, our  farmers have achieved record produce!"
The farmers produced record output  and this time the country went on to procure record amount of crops.
This time in many places farmers have got more than the minimum support  price (MSP) for mustard.
"Due to the record food grain production, our  country has been able to provide support to every countryman."
"Today, 800  million underprivileged denizens are being provided free ration in this  hour of crisis."
"So, no such a day ever occurs in a needy home when the  stove is not lit!"
"Friends, today the  farmers of our country are doing wonders in many areas by taking  advantage of the new arrangements."
"Take for example, the farmers of  Agartala."
These farmers produce very good jackfruit harvest.
"Anticipating their demand in the country and abroad, this time the  jackfruit of farmers of Agartala was brought to Guwahati by rail."
These  jackfruit are now being sent to London from Guwahati.
"Similarly, you  must have also heard the name of the Shahi Litchi of Bihar."
"In 2018, the  Government also gave GI Tag to Shahi Litchi so that its identity would  be reinforced and the farmers would get more benefits."
This time the  Shahi Litchi of Bihar has also been sent to London by air.
"From East to  West, North to South our country is full of such unique flavors and  products."
You must definitely have heard about the mangoes of  Vizianagaram in South India.
Now who wouldn't like to eat this mango?
"Therefore, now the Kisan Rail is ferrying hundreds of tons of  Vizianagaram mangoes to Delhi."
"The people of Delhi and North India will  get to eat Vizianagaram mangoes, and the farmers of Vizianagaram will  earn well."
The Kisan Rail has so far transported nearly 2 lakh tonnes of  produce.
"Now the farmers are able to send fruits, vegetables, grains to  other remote parts of the country at a very low cost."
"My dear  countrymen, today on 30th May we are having 'Mann Ki Baat' and  incidentally it also marks the completion of 7 years of the government."
"Over these years, the country has followed the mantra of 'Sabka-Saath,  Sabka-Vikas, Sabka-Vishwas'."
All of us have worked every moment with  dedication in the service of the country.
"Many friends have sent me  letters and said that in 'Mann Ki Baat', I should also discuss our  mutual journey of 7 years."
"Friends, whatever we have accomplished in  these 7 years, it has been of the country, of the countrymen."
"Together,  we have experienced many moments of national pride in these years."
"When  we observe that now India moves ahead not with the thought and pressure  of other countries but with her own conviction, then we all feel proud."
"When we witness that now India gives a befitting reply to those who  conspire against us, then our confidence soars."
"When India does not  compromise on the issues of national security, when the strength of our  armed forces increases, we feel that yes, we are on the right path."
"Friends,  I get messages and letters from countless countrymen spanning every  corner of the country."
"Many people are thankful to the country that  electricity has reached their village for the first time in 70 years,  that their sons and daughters are studying in the light, under the fan."
Many people say that our village too is now connected to the city by a  paved road.
"I remember some friends from a tribal area had sent me a  message that after the road was built, for the first time they felt that  they too had joined the rest of the world."
"Similarly, someone shares  the joy of opening a bank account, someone starts a new employment with  the help of different schemes, then they also invite me in sharing that  happiness."
"I keep receiving many invitations from our countrymen for the  occasion of ‘GrihPravesh’ - the house warming ceremony, after receiving  their home under the 'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana'."
"In these 7 years, I  have been associated with a million moments of your happiness."
"Just a  few days ago, a family from a village sent me a photo of the water tap  installed in their house under the 'Jal Jeevan Mission'."
"They had  captioned the photo ‘मेरेगाँवकीजीवनधारा’ - the lifeline of my village,  there are many such families!"
"In the 7 decades after independence, only  three and a half crore rural homes of our country had water connections."
"However, just in the last 21 months, four and a half crore houses have  been given clean water connections."
"Of these, 15 months were of the  Corona period!"
A similar confidence has come to the country through the  'Ayushman Yojana'.
"When the poor come home healthy with free treatment,  they feel that they have got a new life."
They feel confident that the  country stands by them.
"With the blessing of such families, the  blessings of crores of mothers, our country is moving towards  development with strength."
"Friends, in these 7 years, India has  worked to show the world a new direction in digital transactions."
"Today, you can make digital payments with absolute ease at any place; it  is proving very useful even in this time of Corona."
"Today, the  seriousness and awareness of the countrymen towards cleanliness is  increasing."
We are also launching record satellites and constructing  record roads too.
"In these 7 years, many old contestations of the  country have also been resolved with complete peace and harmony."
A new  confidence of peace and development has arisen from the northeast to  Kashmir.
"Friends, have you thought all such work which could not be  achieved even in decades, how were they done in these 7 years?"
"All this  was possible because in these 7 years, more than as the Government or as  the people, we worked together as one country."
We worked as a team.
We  worked as Team India.
Every citizen has tried to take a few steps  forward in advancing the country.
Yes!
"Where there are successes, there  are also trials."
"In these 7 years together, we have overcome many  difficult tests as well, and each time we have all emerged stronger."
"In  the form of the Corona pandemic, we are being continuously put to test."
"This is a crisis that has plagued the whole world, so many people have  lost their loved ones."
Even big countries were not spared from its  devastation.
"In the midst of this pandemic, India is moving forward with  the resolve of ‘सेवा और सहयोग’- 'service and cooperation'."
"In the first  wave, we fought courageously; this time too India will be victorious in  the ongoing fight against the virus."
"Be it ‘दो गज की दूरी’ social  distancing, rules related to masks or vaccines, there should be no letup  in our efforts."
This indeed is the path to our victory.
"Next time when  we meet in Mann Ki Baat, we will talk about many more inspiring examples  of countrymen and discuss new topics."
Do continue to keep sending me  your suggestions.
"May all of you stay healthy, keep the country moving  forward in this manner."
Many many thanks!
"Today is the festival of Vijaydashami, that is Dussehra."
"On this auspicious occasion, heartiest greetings to all of you."
The festival of Dussehra is one of the triumph of truth over untruth.
"But, simultaneously, it is also the festival of victory of patience over crises."
"Today, all of you are carrying on with immense patience, celebrating the festival with restraint….and hence, in our ongoing fight, our victory too is assured."
"Earlier, people used to throng Durga Pandals for a Darshan of Maa."
The atmosphere would be almost that of a carnival…but it was not possible this time.
"Earlier, grand fairs used to be held on the occasion of Dussehra…but in present times, they took on a different form."
"The festival of Ramleela too was one of its major attractions….but now, that too has been restricted to some extent."
"Earlier during Navratra, the notes of Garba of Gujarat would reverberate all over….this time all grand events have been curtailed."
Many more festivals are on the way in the days to come.
"There is Eid, Sharad Poornima, Valmiki Jayanti, followed by Dhanteras, Diwali, Bhai dooj, the Pooja of Chatthi Maiyya and the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji…..during this crisis-laden period of Corona, we have to exercise patience, observe restraint."
"Friends, when we talk about festivals and make preparations for them, the first thought that strikes us is when to go to the market, what all has to be purchased."
"Children especially are enthusiastic about it, wondering what they would receive this time in the festival season."
The fervour of festivals and the glitter and sparkle of the marketplace are interconnected.
"But this time when you go shopping, do remember our resolve of ‘Vocal for Local’."
"While purchasing items from the market, we have to accord priority to local products."
"Friends, amid the gaiety of festivities, we should spare a thought for the lockdown period."
"During the lockdown, we closely came to know about those members of society, without whom our lives would be miserable."
"Sanitation workers, brothers and sisters working as domestic helps, local vegetable vendors, milkmen, security guards….we have now felt the significance of their roles in our lives in a better way."
"""During the moment of crisis, they were with you they stood by all of us."""
"Now, during the festivities, amid the rejoicing, we must take them along."
"I earnestly urge you to ensure, in whatever way, in making them a part of your celebrations."
Treat them as members of your own family…..you will see for yourself how your joy rises by leaps and bounds.
"Friends, we must also think of our braveheart soldiers who are firmly stationed on our borders in the line of duty, even during these festive times…all in the service and security of Mother India."
We have to celebrate our festivals bearing them in mind.
We have to light a lamp at home in honour of these brave sons and daughters of Mother India.
"I would also like to assure our brave soldiers that despite they being away at the borders, the entire country is with them, wishing well for them."
"I also salute the sacrifice of those families, whose sons and daughters are on the border today."
I express gratitude to each and every person who is away from home and family on account of discharging duty to the country in one way or the other.
"My dear countrymen, today when we are going vocal for local, the whole world are also becoming a fan of our local products."
Many of our local products have the potential of becoming global.
One such example is Khadi.
Khadi has remained a symbol of simplicity over a long period of time but now our khadi is getting known as an eco friendly fabric.
"In terms of health, this is a body friendly fabric, an all weather fabric and now it has also become a fashion statement."
Not only is the popularity of khadi rising it is also being produced in many places of the world.
"There is a place in Mexico called Oaxaca, there are many villages in this area where the local villagers weave khadi."
Today the khadi of this place has gained popularity by the name Oaxaca khaadi.
How khadi reached Oaxaca is no less interesting.
"In fact a young person of Oaxaca, Mark Brown once watched a movie on Mahatma Gandhi."
"Brown got so inspired by watching this movie on Bapu that he visted Bapu’s ashram in India, understood him and learnt about him in depth."
"""It was then, that Brown realised that khadi was not just a cloth it was a complete way of life."""
Brown was deeply moved by the way khadi was intertwined with the rural economy and self sufficiency.
It was here that Brown resolved to work on khadi on his return to Mexico.
He introduced the villagers of Oaxaca in Mexico to khadi and trained them.
And now Oaxaca khadi has become a brand.
The website of this project bears the inscription ‘the symbol of Dharma in motion’.
You can also find a very interesting interview of Marc Brown on this website.
He narrates that initially the people were wary of khadi but ultimately they got interested and a market got ready for it.
"He states that these are matters related to Ram Rajya, when you fulfill the needs of the people, the people start connecting with you."
"Friends,this time on Gandhi Jayanti the khadi store in Cannaught Place at Delhi witnessed purchases of over one crore rupees in just a day."
Similarly the khadi masks have also become very popular during Corona.
Self help groups and other such institutions are making khadi masks in many places of the country.
There is a woman Suman Devi Ji in Barabanki of U.P.
"Suman ji , alongwith her friends of a self help group started making Khadi masks.Gradualy more and more women started joining her and now together they are producing thousands of khadi masks."
Our local products have this beauty that often a complete philosophy is enshrined in them.
"My dear countrymen, when we take pride in our own things, the world’s curiosity around them also grows – Just like our spirituality, Yoga, Ayurveda has attracted the whole world."
Many of our indigenous sports also attract attention the world over.
Nowadays our Mallakhambh too is gaining popularity in many countries.
"When Chinmay Patankar and Pragya Patankar decided to teach Mallakhambh out of their home in America, little did they know how successful it would be."
Mallakhambh training centers are running at many locations across America.
A large number of American Youth are joining and learning Mallakhambh.
"Be it Germany, Poland or Malaysia - Mallakhambh is becoming popular in around 20 other countries."
"And now, its World Championship has also been started which sees participants from many countries."
Ancient India had many such sports which would bring about extraordinary growth within oneself - they give new dimensions to our mind and body balance.
"However, probably our young friends of the new generation are not that acquainted with Mallakhambh."
Do search more about it on the internet and see for yourself.
"Friends, our country has many forms of martial arts."
I would like our young friends to know more about them learn them and over the course of time bring about innovations in the same.
"When there are no major challenges to face in one’s life, the best of one’s personality also fails to surface – hence always keep on challenging yourselves."
"My dear countrymen, it is said that learning is growing."
Today in Mann ki baat I will introduce you to a person who has a novel passion.
This is the passion of sharing the joys of reading and writing with others.
He is Pon Mariyappan from Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu.
Thoothukudi is also known as the Pearl City.
Once it was an important centre of the Pandyan Empire.
My friend from this town Pon Marriyappan is associated with the profession of hair cutting and runs a salon.
A very small salon.
He has done an exemplary and an inspiring piece of work.
He has converted a small portion of his salon into a library.
"If a customer, while waiting for his turn, reads something from the library and writes on that, Pon Marriyappan, offers him a discount"
I could not further my studies beyond that due to family circumstances.
"When I see educated people, I feel something amiss in me."
"So, I thought why not establish a library, which would benefit many people, this became an inspiration for me."
I too am feeling extremely happy while talking to respected Prime Minister.
We just spoke to Pon Mariyappan ji.
"See how he dresses people’s hair, he gives them an opportunity to dress up their lives too."
It felt nice to learn about the popularity of Thirukkural.
All of you too heard about the populairity of Thirukkural.
"Today, Thirukkural is available in all languages of India."
"Given an opportunity, one must read it."
"In a way, it is a guide for life."
"Friends, but you will be happy to know that all over India there are several people who get immense happiness spreading knowledge."
These are people who are always eager to get everyone inspired to study.
"A teacher from Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh, Usha Dubey ji in fact, has turned a scooty into a mobile library."
Every day she goes to some village or the other with her mobile library and teaches children there.
"Children lovingly call her ‘kitabon waali Didi’, the elder sister with books."
"This year in August, at Rayo village in Nirjuli of Arunachal Pradesh, a Self Help Library has been set up."
"In fact, when Meena Gurung and Dewang Hosayi from this village learnt that there was no library in the area they extended a hand for its funding."
You will be surprised to know that there is no membership for this library.
Anyone can borrow books for two weeks.
One has to return them after reading.
"This library is open all seven days, 24 hours."
Parents around are quite happy that their children are busy reading books… especially when schools too have started online classes.
"In Chandigarh, Sandeep Kumar who runs an NGO has set up a mobile library in a mini van, through which, poor children are given books to read free of cost."
"Along with this I know two organisations in Bhav Nagar, Gujarat which are doing marvellous work."
Of these one is Vikas Vartul Trust.
This organisation is very helpful to students who are preparing for competitive exams.
"This trust has been working since 1975 and provides 140 magazines, along with 5000 books."
‘Pustak Parab’ is a similar organization.
"This in an innovative project which provides literary books along with other books, free of cost."
"In this library, books related to spirituality, ayurvedic treatment and many other subjects also are included."
"If you are aware of other such initiatives, I urge you to certainly share that on social media."
"These examples are not limited just to reading books or opening libraries, but are also symbolic of that spirit of the New India, where in every field, people of every stratum are adopting innovative ways for the development of the society."
"It has been mentioned in the Geeta-Na hi gyanen sadrishyam pavitramih vidyate. Meaning, there is nothing as sacred as knowledge in this world."
"Those who spread knowledge, who take such noble initiatives, I commend all such great people from the core of my heart."
"My dear countrymen, in a few days we will celebrate Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel’s birth anniversary, the 31st of October as ‘National Unity Day’."
"Earlier too, we have talked in detail on Sardar Patel in Mann Ki Baat."
We have talked about the many dimensions of his great personality.
"You will come across few people whose personality has so many elements- depth of thoughts, moral courage, political genius, in depth knowledge of the field of agriculture and spirit of commitment to national unity."
Do you know of one thing that showcases the sense of humour of Sardar Pate?
"Just visualize the image of the Iron-man who was interacting simultaneously with kings and royalty, managing the mass movements of revered Bapu, and also fighting against the British… and in all these his sense of humour too was in full form."
Bapu had said that the jestful banter of Sardar Patel made him laugh so much that he would get cramps in the stomach. This happened not just once but several times during the day.
"Friends,this  time on Gandhi Jayanti the khadi store in Cannaught Place at Delhi  witnessed purchases of over one crore rupees in just a day."
"""In it there is a lesson for us too… keep alive your sense of humour irrespective of how difficult the situations are, not only will this keep us at ease, we will be able to find solutions to our problems."""
This is exactly what Sardar sahib did.
"My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel devoted his entire life for the unity of the country."
He integrated the Indian public with the Freedom Movement.
He endeavored to connect the issues of farmers with Independence.
He worked for the integration of the Princely States with our nation.
He was invoking the mantra of ‘unity in diversity’ in the mind of every Indian.
"Friends, today through our speech, our bearing and our actions, every moment we have to carry forward the entire spectrum of values that unite us… so that a sense of ease and belongingness is inculcated in the mind of the citizen living in one part of the country for the citizen living in the other."
Our ancestors have made these efforts incessantly for centuries.
"Now, for example His Holiness Adi Shankaracharya was born in Kerala and established four important mathas in all four directions of India… Badrikashram in the North, Puri in the East, Sringeri in the South and Dwarka in the West."
"He also traveled to Srinagar and that is the reason, a 'Shankracharya Hill' exists there."
"""Pilgrimage in itself knits India in a common thread, the chain of Jyotirlingas and Shaktipeethas binds India with the common thread."""
"Our centres of faith established from Tripura to Gujarat and from Jammu and Kashmir to Tamil Nadu, unite us as one."
"The Bhakti movement became a mass movement throughout India, uniting us through Bhakti, devotion.These elements with the strength of unity have been assimilated in our day to day lives."
"The various rivers in our country are invoked before each ritual, ranging from the Indus located in the far north to the Kaveri, the lifeline of South India."
"Often people in our country say or chant while bathing with a hallowed belief, the mantra of unity:"
Our Sikh Gurus too have enriched the spirit of unity through their lives and noble deeds.
"In the last century, in our country, we have had luminaries such as Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar who forged unity among us all through the medium of the Constitution."
The country too has given a befitting reply to these ill-intentions every time.
We have to constantly try through our creativity and love to bring out the beautiful colors of 'Ek Bharat-Shrestha Bharat' even in the smallest of our tasks!
"New colors of unity have to be filled in, and every citizen must fill them."
"In this context, I urge all of you to visit a website - ekbharat.gov.in."
This website displays our many efforts made to advance our campaign of national integration.
It also has an interesting corner –The sentence for the day.
"In this section, we can learn how to speak a sentence in different languages every day."
"You can also contribute to this website, for example every state and its culture has different kinds of cuisines."
These dishes are made with special local ingredients comprising grains and spices.
"Can we share the recipe of these local foods along with the names of the local ingredients, on the ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat’ website?"
What can be a better way to propagate unity and immunity!
"Friends, on the 31stof this month, I will have the opportunity to attend many events to be held in and around the historic Statue of Unity in Kevadiya…do connect with these."
"My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October we will also celebrate 'Valmiki Jayanti'."
I pay my obeisance to Maharishi Valmiki and extend my heartiest greetings to the countrymen on this special occasion.
Maharishi Valmiki’s lofty ideals continue to inspire millions of people and provide them strength.
He is a beacon of great hope for millions of the impoverished and Dalits… instills hope and trust within them.
"He says that if anyone has will power, one can achieve anything with ease."
"It is this will power, which provides the strength to many young people to do extraordinary things."
"Maharishi Valmiki emphasized positive thinking - for him, the spirit of service and human dignity were of utmost importance."
"Maharishi Valmiki's conduct, thoughts and ideals are the inspiration and guiding force for our resolve for a New India."
We will always be grateful to Maharishi Valmiki for composing an epic like Ramayana to guide the future generations.
"On the 31st of October we lost former Prime Minister of India, Smt. Indira Gandhi."
I most respectfully pay my tributes to her.
"My dear countrymen, today, Pulwama in Kashmir is playing an important role in educating the entire country."
"The Kashmir Valley meets almost 90% demand for the Pencil Slats, timber casings of the entire country, and of that, a very large share comes from Pulwama."
"Once upon a time we used to import wood for pencils from abroad, but, now our Pulwama is making the country self-sufficient in the field of pencil making."
"In fact, these Pencil Slats of Pulwama are reducing the gaps between states!"
"Chinar wood of the valley has high moisture content and softness, which makes it most suitable for the manufacture of pencils."
"In Pulwama, Oukhoo is known as the Pencil Village."
"Here, several manufacturing units of Pencil Slats are located, which provide employment, and, in these units, a large number of women are employed."
"Friends, Pulwama gained this recognition when individuals of this place decided to do something new, took risks and dedicated themselves towards it."
One such enterprising person is Manzoor Ahmad Alai.
"Earlier, Manzoor bhai was a simple workman involved in woodcutting."
Manzoor bhai wanted to do something new so that his coming generations wouldn’t have to live in poverty.
He sold his ancestral land and established a unit to manufacture Apple wooden boxes.
"He was engaged in his small business when he came to know that Poplar wood , Chinar wood is being used in manufacturing pencils."
"After getting this information, Manzoor bhai channeled his entrepreneurial spirit and started the supply of Poplar wooden boxes to some famous pencil manufacturing units."
Manzoor Ji found this to be extremely profitable and his income grew considerably at the same time.
"With the passage of time, he bought pencil slat manufacturing machinery and started the supply of pencil slats to some of the biggest companies of the country."
"Today, Manzoor bhai’s turnover from this business is in crores and is a source of livelihood for around two hundred people."
"Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I, on behalf of all countrymen commend Manzoor bhai and the enterprising brothers and sisters of Pulwama along with their families - All of you are making invaluable contribution in educating the young minds of our country."
"My dear countrymen, during the lockdown, many instances of technology based service delivery were explored in the country and it is not that only the big technology and logistic companies are capable of the same."
A self help group of women in Jharkhand have accomplished this feat.
These women got an app ‘Ajivika Farm Fresh’ designed through which people could directly order vegetables to be delivered at their homes.
"Through this initiative, the farmers were ensured of a fair price for their produce and fresh vegetables were also available for the buyers."
This idea of ‘Ajivika farm fresh’ app is gaining a lot of popularity there .
"Friends, with emerging possibilities in the agriculture sector, more and more youth are now engaging themselves in this field."
Atul Patidar of Barwani in Madhya Pradesh has connected four thousand farmers in his area through the digital medium.
"Through the E-platform farm card of Atul Patidar, farmers are now able to get the essentials of agriculture - such as fertilizer, seeds, pesticide, fungicide etc home delivered - the farmers get what they need at their doorstep."
Modern agricultural equipment is also available for hire on this digital platform.
"Even during lockdown, thousands of packets containing seeds of cotton and vegetables were delivered to farmers through this digital platform."
Atul ji and his team are working to impart technological knowhow to the farmers and also teaching them about online payment and procurement.
"Friends, recently, one incident in Maharashtra caught my attention."
"There, one farmer producer company procured corn from the corn producing harvesters."
"This time, the company paid not just the cost of the corn but also an additional bonus with it."
This was a pleasant surprise for the farmers.
"When the company was asked for the same, they said that under the new farm specific laws framed by Government of India, farmers are able to sell their produce in any part of the country and are getting good prices for the same."
"Thus, the company thought of sharing their extra profits with the farmers."
The farmers had a right to it and hence the bonus was shared with them.
"Friends, the bonus amount may be small but this initiative is big."
"Through this, we come to know that on ground, the new agriculture laws are full of possibilities in favour of the farmers."
"My dear countrymen, in today’s Mann Ki Baat, I have had the opportunity to bring forth extraordinary stories of my countrymen, the country and the facets of our traditions."
Our country is full of talented people.
"If you too know of any such individual, speak and write about them and share their accomplishments."
My best wishes to you and your family for the forthcoming festivals.
"However, do remember and more so during the festivals - wear your masks, keep washing your hands with soap and maintain two yards of social distance."
"Friends, we will speak again in next month’s Mann Ki Baat."
Many Many thanks.
"There must be hardly an Indian citizen who does not show deep regard for her, does not revere her."
"She is elder to most of us and has been a witness to myriad phases, different eras the country has passed through."
"We address her as “DIDI”, elder sister…."
She turns ninety this 28th of September.
"Before leaving on the foreign tour, I was blessed with an opportunity to converse with her on the phone."
This chat was akin to a younger brother speaking to his elder sister affectionately.
"""I usually refrain from sharing such personal conversations but today, I want you to listen to the tete a tete listen to Lata Didi."""
"Listen to it for yourself how Lata Didi is earnestly concerned and eager about everything concerning the country. ""Her satisfaction and reassurance too, lies in the progress being made by India, the India on the path of change, the India that is gaining newer heights."""
"Modi Ji : Didi, you are greater, not only in terms of age, but also, in terms of your illustrious work."
"Your attainment through your glorious achievements are the result of your perseverance, your Sadhana & Tapasya."
"All this is just the fruit of the blessings of my parents the blessings of my listeners."""
"For everyone from the new generation, it is a lesson."
"For us it is an immense source of inspiration that even after reaching glorious heights, you have always accorded the highest priority to acknowledge the upbringing, the sanskar bestowed by your parents and also to being humble."
And it gives me joy when you proudly say that your mother was a Gujarati.
"Didi, all we want is that you continue blessing us, blessing the whole country, may we keep on doing the good work."
I keep getting your letters and gifts as well. Our close bond feels like family and gives me immense joy.
"After you had gone to touch your mother’s feet, I too sent someone to her to seek her blessings."
"Once again, I extend my heartiest wishes for your birthday."
"This time when I had come to Mumbai, I felt like meeting you in person."
"My dear countrymen, with the advent of Navaratri today, the air is bound to be full of new hopes, new energy, newer zest and newer resolves, once again."
"After all, it’s the festival season."
The ensuing weeks shall be witness to the sparkle of festivals throughout the country.
"All of us shall celebrate the NavaratriMahotsava, Garba, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali, BhaiyaDooj, Chhath Puja…."
in fact innumerable festivals.
Heartiest greetings to all of you for these festivals to come.
"During festivals, families come together."
Homes will be filled with joy! But… you must have felt this… there are many people around us who remain deprived of these celebrations.
"And this is what is termed as “Chiragh Tale Andhera”, darkness just beneath the lamp!"
"""Perhaps this adage is not just a set of words for us, it is an order a philosophical thought, or an inspiration."""
"""Just think about it there are some homes, bathed in shimmering lights on the other hand, just close by, there are some homes mired in darkness."""
Indeed it is.
The true joy radiating out of festivals is only when the darkness subsides and dissipates and a radiant glow emerges.
"Let us distribute joy, where there is a paucity of it… let it come naturally to us."
"On the one hand, when we experience the ‘Delivery In’ of sweetmeats, apparel, gifts and so on, let us think for a moment on the process of ‘Delivery Out’."
"At least in our homes, items that are in excess and thus, not required anymore, could be allocated for ‘Delivery Out’."
"In many cities, many NGOs run by young friends have formed Start ups for this endeavor."
"They collect clothes, sweets, food from homes, look for the needy and hand them over discreetly."
"Can we, this time, during the festival season, dispel some of the darkness beneath the lamp with due awareness and resolve?"
The smiles thus accrued on the faces of numerous underprivileged families will more than double your joy during festivals… your faces will be lit up with a glow that will brighten your Diwali immensely.
"My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi, the goddess of wealth, makes an entry into each and every household in the form of fortune and prosperity."
"Of course, Laxmi should be welcomed in the traditional way."
"Can we, this time, introduce a novelty in welcoming her?"
"In our culture, daughters are considered Laxmi, since they are harbinger of fortune and prosperity."
"Can we, this time around in society, organize programmes to felicitate daughters in villages, towns and cities?"
It could be in the form of a public function.
"There must be numerous daughters amongst us who, through there perseverance, diligence and talent have brought glory to their families, society and the country."
"This Diwali, can we arrange programmes to honor the Laxmi of India?"
"Some must be engaged in teaching underprivileged children, others could be occupied in spreading awareness in the field of sanitation and health, while many could be doing society a service by working as Doctor and Engineers."
Or striving for justice to someone by working as Lawyer!
"Our society must recognize such daughters, honor them and feel proud of them."
Programmes to felicitate them should be held throughout the country.
"""We could do something more we could highlight the achievements of these daughters by sharing their achievements on social media."
"The way we jointly ran a mega campaign “Selfi with daughter”, which spread globally."
"Similarly, this time, let us do a campaign BHARAT KI LAXMI."
Encouraging the Laxmi of Bharat amounts to strengthening the paths of prosperity for the country and her citizens.
"My dear countrymen, as I have mentioned earlier, a great advantage of Mann Ki Baat is that, I’m blessed with the opportunity to converse with a lot of people, known or unknown, directly or indirectly."
"Let me read out the letter to you. Respected Mr. Prime Minister, my name is Aleena Taayang."
"I hail from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh."
"On my exam result this time, some people asked me if I had read the book Exam Warriors!"
"But on returning, I purchased the book and read it more than twice."
My experience after that has been very good.
"I felt, had I read the book before my exams, I would’ve benefitted a great deal."
"I liked quite a few aspects of this book, but I noticed that it contains may mantras for students, but for parents and teachers this book does not have much."
"""I wish, if you are thinking anew on a new edition, do include a few mantras for parents and teachers and of course new content."""
"""See… even my young friends bear this trust that whatever they ask the Pradhan Sevak, the principal servant of the country to do, it will be done."""
"My young student friends, first of all, I thank you for writing to me."
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors more than twice .
"And special thanks for pointing out shortcomings in the book. At the same time, my little friend has entrusted me with a task, in fact there are orders for me."
I shall certainly comply with your directions.
"As you have told me, I shall positively try to write something for parents as well as teachers, as and when I get the time to pen a new edition."
But I urge all of you… can you be of help to me?
It is about experiences in your daily lives.
"I call upon all students, teachers and parents to come up with your experiences and suggestions on aspects of stress free exams."
"I shall duly go through them, study them."
"I’ll give it due thought and whatever comes across as apt, I shall try and incorporate that in my own words. And quite possibly, if the suggestions are sufficiently large in number, it will lend certitude to the idea of a new edition."
"So, I shall eagerly wait for your thoughts to flow."
"Once again, I express my gratitude to our little friend, student Aleena Taayang from Arunachal."
"My dear countrymen, you update yourselves with the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and television, you even discuss the engagements."
"But, I hope you are aware that I am just as common a being as you are."
"Being an ordinary citizen, whatever affects you has the same effect on me, since I’m just one amongst you."
"""Just see how on the one hand, victory in the U.S. open was discussed on the other, runner up Daniil Medvedev’s speech was equally doing the rounds in public discourse, especially on social media."" Hence I too heard the speech and watched the match."
The sheer simplicity and maturity displayed by the 23 year old Daniil Medvedev touched everyone.
It surely stirred me.
"Moments before this speech, he had suffered defeat at the hands of Tennis legend Rafael Nadal, 19 times grand slam winner."
"""An event such as this would have pushed anyone towards remorse and despair,in the case of Medvedev, there was no sign of the slightest pallor on his countenance."""
"Rather, his expression lit up the faces of those watching him with meaningful smiles."
"""He won hearts with his humility and simplicity, the epitome of the spirit of sportsmanship in the truest sense that he is, in letter and spirit."""
Spectators welcomed his reflections with warmth and fervor.
"He also touched upon Nadal being the inspiring force in Tennis for millions of young people, adding how difficult it was to face him in the game."
The way Medvedev heaped praise on his opponent after a defeat in a fierce duel makes him a living example of the true essence of the spirit of sportsmanship.
"Of course, on the other hand champion Nadal too showered glowing praise on Daniil’s game."
The display of the indomitable ardour of the defeated and the sheer humility of the victorious in the same frame was a sight to behold.
"If you haven’t heard Medvedev’s speech yet, I shall urge you, especially young friends to watch this video."
It holds much for people across the age and class spectra to see and learn.
"These are moments that go way beyond winning and losing, where victory and defeat cease to be."
It is life that is victory. This has been beautifully articulated in our scriptures.
The wisdom of our ancestors is truly praiseworthy.
"My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to tellyou now is directly for your benefit."
"Discourses and debates will continue, the support and opposition will continue, but, if some things are checked before they proliferate, then there is a huge benefit."
Things that spawn and spread a lot are very difficult to stop at later stages.
"But, if we become aware at an early stage and put a stop to it, then a lot can be saved."
"Continuing in the same vein, I feel, today, that I should definitely have a talk with my young friends."
"We all know that addiction to, tobaccois very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit this addiction."
"People who consume tobacco are vulnerable to high risk diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure etc."
Everyone knows that.
Tobacco intoxication occurs due to the nicotine present in it.
Brain development is hampered by its consumption during adolescence.
"But, today, I want to have a discourse with you on a new topic."
"You must be knowing that, recently the e-cigarette got banned in India."
"An e-cigarette is a type of electronic device unlike a typical cigarette.In ane-cigarette, theheating of nicotine-containing fluids creates a type of chemical smoke and this is the pathway through which nicotine is consumed."
"While we all understand the dangers of common cigarettes, a misconception has been generated about e-cigarettes."
The myth that has been spread is that e-cigarettes pose no danger.
"Like the conventional cigarette, it does not spread odour as fragrant chemicals are added to it."
"We have seen around us, that, even if the father in any house is a chain smoker, still he tries to stop the rest of the household from smoking and wants his children not to fall prey to the habit of cigarettes or bidis."
His effort is that no family member should take to smoking.
He knows that smoking or tobacco causes great damage to the body.
There is no confusion about the dangers posed by a cigarette.
It only causes harm and this even its seller too knows.
The smoker also knows this fact and so do people around.
But the case of e-cigarettes is quite different.
There is little awareness among people about e-cigarette.
They are also completely unaware of its danger and for this reason sometimes e-cigarettessneak into the house out of sheer curiosity.
"And Kids at times pretending to be showing some magical trick, blow smoke in the presence of Peer Company or their parents, without lighting a cigarette or striking a match to light it!"
"And as if a magic show is going on, the family members respond with applause!"
There is no awareness!
"There is no knowledge that once the teenagers or our youth get caught in its clutches, then, slowly, they become hookedand fall prey to this noxious addiction."
"And our real wealth -the youth become condemned to tread on the path of waste, quite unaware!"
"In fact, many harmful chemicals are added to e-cigarettes, which have a deleterious effect on health."
"You are aware of the fact that when someone smokes around us, we come to know about it through its odour."
"Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in someone’s pocket, the smell can be detected."
"However, this is not the case with an e-cigarette and many teenagers and young people, unknowingly and sometimes proudly displaying an e-cigaretteas a fashion statement, keep itbetwixt their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes hold it in their hands and thus fall prey to it."
The younger generation is the future of our country.
The e-cigarette has been banned so that this new form of intoxication does not destroy our demographically young country.
It does not trample the dreams of a family and waste the lives of our children.
This scourge and this obnoxious habit should not become rooted in our society.
I urge all of you to quit the addiction to tobacco and do not harbour any misconceptions about e-cigarettes.
"Come, let us all build a healthy India."
Oh Yes!
Do you still remember Fit India?
"Fit India does not mean that if we go to the gym for two hours every morning and evening, it will suffice!"
All these addictions have to be avoided to be a part of Fit India.
"""I am sure you will not misconstrue whatever I’ve said, but rather happily accept my counsel, I will definitely like it."""
"My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great providence that our India has been the birthplace and work-place of extraordinary denizens, who spent all their lives, not for themselves, but for the good of the society."
"Our Mother India, our country is a bountiful land!"
Many gems of human beings took birth here.
"India has not only been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, but also the land of their karma."
And these are the people who have spent themselves in service of others.
One such illustrious Indian is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
"It is a matter of pride for every Indian that, on the coming 13thOctober, His Holiness Pope Francis will declare Sister MariamThresia a saint."
"Sister MariamThresia, in her short lifespan of 50 years, worked for the good of humanity becoming a noble example for the entire world."
"She had built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and throughout her life, remained devoted to this cause."
"I once again pay heart felt tributes to Sister MariamThresia and congratulate the citizens of India, and especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement."
"My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world today, while we are celebrating ‘Gandhi 150’, our 130 crore countrymen have pledged to be rid from the menace of Single Use Plastic."
"In view of the kind of lead that India has taken towards environmental protection, today the countries of the entire world are looking towards India as a model example."
I am confident that you will all be a part of the campaign for liberation from the menace of Single Use Plastic on 2ndOctober.
"In India, citizens are contributing in this campaign in their own way."
"But, a young man from our country has initiated a very unique campaign."
"My attention was drawn towards his work, so, I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand the new experiment being attempted by him."
It could be that this attempt of his may work for other people of our country.
Mr. RipudamanBelviji is making an unique effort by attempting plogging!
"When I first encountered the term Plogging, it was novel even to me."
Perhaps this word is in usage in certain measure in foreign lands.
Let's talk to him.
"You have designed this entire programme in a very innovative manner, in a way that it will be liked, especially by young people."
Heartiest congratulation to you.
"And friends this time on the anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports too is organizing a ‘Fit India Plogging Run’."
"""On the 2nd of October, plogging for two kilometers, and it will be held across the country."""
"""We heard through the experiences of Ripudaman Ji, how this programme should be organised, what it should consist of."""
"""What we have to do in this campaign that commences on 2nd of Octoberis that while we jog for 2 kilometers and on the way, collect all kinds of plastic waste."""
"""Through endeavor, we shall not only pay better attention to our health we shall also take a step towards ensuring protection for Mother Earth."""
"""This campaign is resulting in raising awareness levels in people as far as sanitation and cleanliness, along with fitness levels."""
I do believe that a single step towards freedom from single use plastic taken by 130 crore countrymen will give India a lead by a 130 crore steps.
"Ripudaman ji, once again, many thanks to you."
"And to your team, and your imaginative, innovative bent of mind, heartiest congratulations from my side."
Thank you.
"My dear countrymen, groundwork for 2ndOctober is going on all over the country and also the world over, but we want to transmute 'Gandhi 150' as a task on the path of our duty."
We want to move forward devoting our lives in the interest of the nation.
I would like to remind you one thing in advance.
"Although in the next episode of 'Mann Ki Baat' I shall dwell upon it in detail, still today I am telling this ina advance so that you get time to prepare."
"""You do remember that, 31stOctober is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and that ‘Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat’ is our common dream, hence for that reason, every year on 31 October, we run for fostering unison in the country as 'Run for Unity', all over the nation."""
"""We have to run for the unity of the country on that day in in large numbers, elders, everyone, schools, colleges, all of us have to run for unity in lakhs of villages across the span of Hindustan."""
"So, better start preparing from this instant onwards!"
"""I shall talk about it in detail later, but right now we have time on our hands"
"My dear countrymen, you will remember, that on 15 August, I had in my address said from the ramparts of Red Fort that by 2022, you should visit 15 tourist destinations in India."
"At least 15 places and if possible, make a program to stay over there for an over night, two-night stay."
"You should observe, understand and experience India."
We have so much diversity.
"And when holidays come in the shape of Diwali and allied festivals, people do travel and that's why I urge you to visit any 15 such places in India."
"My dear countrymen, the 27th of September, two days prior to today, was celebrated as World Tourism Day and you will be happy to know that certain reputed tourism agencies of the world which rank standards of travel & tourism have shown that India has displayed a lot of improvement in the Travel & Tourism Competitive Index."
And all this has been possible due to your cooperation and especially because understanding the importance of tourism has increased.
The Swachhata Abhiyan also has a big role to play in all of this.
"And you will be delighted to know that today our rank is thirty four on this index whereas five years ago we were ranked65th, which in a way is a big jump."
"If we tried all that harder, then by the 75th year of our independence, we would have carved a place for ourselves amidst the major tourist destinations of the world."
"My dear countrymen, once again I wish you all the best for various festivals that would be celebrated in the oncoming season in India, which is filled with diversity!"
Yes!
"Also, please see to it that during the celebration of Diwali, firecrackers do not lead to incidents of fire or loss of a life."
"Whatever precautions or preventive care is to be taken, should be taken during Diwali."
"Happiness should co-exist with joy, and of course there must also be enthusiasm and our festivals do indeed bring the aroma of collectiveness, and also the rituals connected with communal harmony."
Symbiotic living provides us with renewed vigour and the festive season is the symbol of culmination of that renewed vigour.
"Together brimming with enthusiasm, renewed dreams and resolutions we should celebrate."
Once again here’s wishing many felicitations to you all.
"On the pious festival of Deepawali, greetings  to all of you."
"We are familiar with the lines of the Shlok- Shubham Karoti Kalyanam, Aarogyam Dhansampadaa."
"Shatrubudhdhi Vinashaay, Deepajyoti Namostute!!"
"What  a fine, purposeful message!"
"The shlok says: It is Light that ushers in  joy, health and prosperity into our lives, dispelling negative thought,  bringing in positivity."
I salute the divine flame respectfully.
"To make  this Diwali memorable, what could be a better way than an attempt to let  light spread its radiance, encouraging positivity, with a prayer to  quell the feeling of animosity?"
These days Diwali is celebrated across  many countries.
"And notably, it is not limited to Indian communities;  even governments, citizens and social organisations wholeheartedly  celebrate Diwali with gaiety and fervour."
"In a way, they nurture a  microcosm of India at their respective places."
"Friends,  festival tourism has its own exciting attractions."
"Our India, the  country of festivals, possesses limitless possibilities in the realm of  festival tourism."
"It must be our endeavour to ensure that we should  welcomingly include people of other states, other countries when we  celebrate Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal or Bihu, spreading their true  spirit."
"Here, every state, every region is replete with distinct  festivals, generating a lot of interest in people from other countries."
"Hence, the Indian Diaspora has a significant role to play in promoting  festival tourism in India ."
"My dear  countrymen, in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to  do something different this Diwali."
"I had urged all of you to celebrate  India’s Nari-Shakti, the power and achievement of women, thereby  felicitating the Lakshmi of India."
"And within no time, there followed a  slew of innumerable inspirational stories on social media."
Kodipaka  Ramesh from Warangal has written on Namo App-“My mother is my strength.
"In 1990, when my father expired, the responsibility to raise five sons  fell on her shoulders."
"Today, all five brothers are doing well in their  respective professions."
My mother is God to me.
"She is the Lakshmi of  India in every sense of the term.” Ramesh ji , respectful greetings to  your mother."
"For Kavita  Tiwari, her daughter is the Lakshmi of India, her strength."
She is proud  of her daughter’s excellent painting ability.
She has also secured a  good rank in the CLAT exam.
Whereas Megha Jain has mentioned that a 92  year old woman has been offering free drinking water to passengers at  Gwalior Railway Station.
Megha Ji is truly inspired by the humility and  compassion of this Lakshmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared  by people.
"Do read them, get inspired and share similar instances. I  respectfully salute all the Lakshmis of India."
"My  dear countrymen, the well known 17th century poetess Sanchi Honnamma  has penned a poem in Kannada"
"That that embodies the same thought, the same  words pertaining to every Lakshmi of India that we referred to. One  feels the foundation of the idea was laid in the 17th century itself."
"Our daughters are our pride…their prodigious  virtuosity cradles our social fabric, ensuring its bright future.M"
The luminescence of Guru Nanak Dev ji’s influence can be felt not only  in India but around the world.
Many of our Sikh brothers and sisters  settled in other countries committedly follow Guru Nanak dev ji’s  ideals.
I can never forget my visits to Gurudwaras in Vancouver and  Tehran.
"There is much about Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you,  but it will require many an episode of Mann ki Baat."
He accorded the  highest significance to the spirit of service.
Guru Nank Dev ji firmly  believed that any service done selflessly was beyond evaluation.
He  stood firm against social ills such as untouchability.
Sri Guru Nanak  Dev ji radiated his message to all corners of the world.
He was the  widest travelled of those times.
"And wherever he went he won hearts  through his straightforwardness, humility and simplicity."
Guru Nanak Ji  undertook many significant spiritual journeys called ‘Udaasi’.
"Carrying  the message of harmony and equality, he travelled north, south, east and  west, meeting people, saints and sages."
It is said that the revered  Assamese saint Shankar Dev too was inspired by him.
He also travelled to  the holy land of Haridwar.
There is a holy place in Kashi named  ‘Gurubagh Gurudwara’.
It is believed that Guru Nanak Dev Ji had halted  there.
He also went to Buddhist holy sites such as Rajgir and Gaya.
"His  journeys to the south took him to Sri Lanka, as well."
"During his Yatra  to Bidar, Karnataka, he devised a solution for water woes the place was  grappling with."
"Gurunanak Jhira Sahib is a famous place in Bidar  dedicated to him, cherishing reminiscences of him."
"During one Udaasi,  Gurunanak Dev Ji travelled north to Kashmir and neighboring areas."
This  forged a strong bond between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev  Ji also went to Tibet where people accorded him the status of a Guru.
"He  is revered in Uzbekistan too, which he had visited."
"During one Udaasi,  he widely travelled to Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq  and Afghanistan."
"He secured a revered place in the hearts of millions  who followed his messages with complete devotion, a practice that  continues even in the present times."
"Just a few days ago, Ambassadors of  approximately eighty-five countries went to Amritsar from Delhi."
"There  in the Golden Temple itself, they undertook a holy Darshan,  commemorating the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji."
"Besides  Darshan, all these Ambassadors had the opportunity to know more about  Sikh traditions and culture."
"Following that, many Ambassadors shared  those photos on social media, writing about their glorious  experiences.It's my devout wish to imbibe Guru Nanak Dev Ji's thoughts  and ideals into our lives; may we be all the more inspired to make it  happen."
"My dear brothers and sisters,  I am sure all of you remember the significance of the 31st of October."
"This day marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar  Vallabhbhai Patel, the unifying force in bonding us as a Nation; our  Hero."
Sardar Patel used to observe  even the minutest of things in-depth; assessing and evaluating them  simultaneously.
He was a 'Man of  Detail' in the true sense of the term.
"Along with that, he was also  adept at organising skills."
Chalking out plans and devising strategies  was his core forte'.
"When we read and hear about Sardar Saheb's style of  working, we come to know of the sheer magnitude of the meticulousness  in his planning."
"In 1921, in the Congress Session in Ahmedabad,  thousands of delegates from across the country were slated to  participate."
Sardar Patel was entrusted with overlooking all the  arrangements.
He utilized this opportunity in improving the city’s water  supply network.
He ensured that not a single person would face a  problem on account of water.
"To ensure  that, what he did will surprise you.He contacted farmers and urged them  to craft khadi bags."
These were made and sold to the delegates.
"They  carried the bags with their shoes inside, free from any tension of the  footwear getting stolen."
"On the other hand, it led to a major rise in  the sale of khadi."
Our country will always be indebted to Sardar Patel  for his steller role in the Constituent Assembly.
He strove to ensure  enshrinement of fundamental rights that obliterated any possibility of  discrimination on the basis of caste and community.
"Friends,  all of us know that as India’s first home minister, Sardar Patel  undertook the colossal, historic task of integrating Princely states."
Scrutinizing the minutest of events closely was his rare quality.
"On the  one hand, he concentrated on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other States; on  the other, he was watching far flung Lakshadweep intently."
"Actually,  when we refer to Sardar Patel’s endeavour, his role in the unification  of just a few notable States is discussed."
"He played a far more  significant role, when it came to a small region such as Lakshadweep  too."
Lakshadweep is one of the most beautiful landscapes in India.
"Soon  after Partition in 1947, our neighbour had cast an eye on Lakshadweep; a  ship bearing their flag was sent there."
"When Sardar Patel was informed  of this, he wasted no time in initiating stern action."
"He urged the  Mudaliar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxman Swamy  Mudaliar to immediately undertake a mission with people of Travancore to  Lakshadweep and take the lead in unfurling the Tricolour there."
"Following his orders, the Tricolour was promptly unfurled there and the  nefarious dreams of the neighbour of annexing Lakshadweep were decimated  within no time."
"After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar  brothers to personally ensure all assistance for development of  Lakshadweep."
"Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly in India’s  progress."
It is an attractive tourist destination too.
I hope you get  the opportunity to visit the picturesque islands and its pristine  beaches.
"My dear countrymen, the 31st  of October, 2018, is the day when the 'Statue of Unity',in memory of  Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world."
It is the  tallest statue in the world.
It is double in height compared to the  'Statue of Liberty' located in the US.
The distinction of having the  world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride; the head of every  Indian is held high.
"You will be happy to note that in a year, more than  26 lakh tourists visited the 'Statue of Unity'."
This means that an  average of eight and a half thousand people witnessed the grandeur of  the 'Statue of Unity' every day.
The reverence and devotion for Sardar  Vallabhbhai Patel in their hearts was reflected in the form of homage  paid to him.
"Besides, at present,it houses many centres of attraction  such as Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Jungle Safari, and Children’s  Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery, which are all constantly evolving and  providing a fillip to the local economy."
"Local people are not only  getting innovative opportunities of employment but for the convenience  of visiting tourists, many villagers are providing facilities like home  stays."
And these hosts are being professionally trained in the technique  of running a home stay.
The locals have now started the cultivation of  Dragon fruit and I am sure that it will soon become a major source of  livelihood for the people there.
"Friends,  for our nation and the constituent states, as well as for the tourism  industry, this 'Statue of Unity' can be a subject of research."
We are  all witness to the fact that how within a year a place developed as a  world famous tourism destination.
People arrive there from the country  and abroad.
"And one after the other, ancillary services like transport,  lodging, guides and eco-friendly services are getting inducted by  themselves."
A large economy is developing and people are generating  facilities as per the requirement of the tourists.
The government is  also playing its role.
"Friends, which Indian will not be imbued with  pride for the fact that recently, Time magazine has included the ‘Statue  of Unity’in its list of 100 important tourist destinations around the  world."
"Of course I hope, that all of you will devote some of your  precious time to visit the ‘Statue of Unity’."
"But my appeal is, that  every Indian who takes out time to travel must visit at least 15 Tourist  Destinations of India with family and experience a night stay at  whichever place you go to; this still remains my appeal."
"Friends,  as you know that 31st October every year since 2014 has been celebrated  as 'National Unity Day'."
"This day imparts the message to protect the  unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost."
"On 31st  October, this year too ‘Run for Unity’ is being organized in consonance  with previous years."
"It will include people from all walks of life, from  every segment of our society."
"‘Run for Unity’ is a symbol of unison,  that the nation being united, is moving in one direction and  collectively aims for- One goal!"
"Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat!"
"The  last five years have witnessed - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of  cities of India, union territories, state capitals, district centres,  even in small cities belonging to tier two or tier three categories,  innumerable men, women, be they the city folk, village folk, children,  the youth, the elderly, divyang, all are participating in‘Run for  Unity’in large numbers."
"Anyway, at present, people have adopted and  found a passion for the marathon."
‘Run for Unity’ is also one such  unique provision.
"Running is beneficial for the mind, body and soul."
"During ‘Run for Unity’not only do we have to run, but in doing so the  spirit of FIT India is also reflected."
We also find ourselves connected  with Ek Bharat- Shrestha Bharat!
"And so, not just our body, but our mind  and value system get integrated with ushering unity in India to take  India to loftier heights!"
"And so, in whichever city you reside, you can  find out about the ‘Run for Unity’ schedule."
A portal namely  runforunity.gov.in has also been launched for dissemination of  information about this event.
"In this portal, information has been  provided about the venues where ‘Run for Unity’ is to be organized  across the country."
"I hope you will all run on October 31st –not only  for the unity of India, but also for your physical fitness!"
"My  dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the nation with the thread of  unison."
"This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our life and in a  country like ours filled with diversities, we should continue to  strengthen this mantra of unison on all paths, at every bend, and at  every pit-stop."
"My dear countrymen, our nation has always been very  proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the  country."
"If we look around us, we will find many examples of individuals  who have been working ceaselessly to foster communal harmony."
"But  sometimes it so happens, that the efforts of the society and its  contribution, get wiped from our collective memory."
"Friends,  I remember when the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on Ram  Janmabhoomi in September 2010."
You could jog your memory a bit and  reflect about the atmosphere then.
Various kinds of people took to the  arena!
Various interest groups were playing games to take advantage of  that situation in their own way!
The kind of language that was spoken in  order to generate tension in the atmosphere!
There was also an attempt  to instill shrillness in the tone of different speakers.
Some of the  loudmouths and the braggarts had the sole intention of hogging the  spotlight at that time.
And we all know what kind of irresponsible talk  was floating around!
"But this scenario had continued for five days, or  seven days, or ten days, but, the delivery of the court’s decision  generated a pleasant and surprising change of mood in the country."
"On  the one hand, the machinations went on to generate tension for week or  two, but, when the decision was taken on Ram Janmabhoomi, the  government, political parties, social organizations, civil society,  representatives of all sects and saints gave restrained and balanced  statements."
There were attempts to reduce the tension in the  sociopolitical environment.
But I remember that day vividly.
"And  whenever I do that, I get happy that the dignity of the judiciary was  very proudly honoured and no allowance for any heated discourse or  tension was made anywhere."
These incidents should always be remembered  as they impart us a lot of strength.
"That day, that moment, instills in  us all a sense of duty."
It is an example of how the voice of unison can  bestow strength upon our country.
"My dear countrymen, on 31st  October, on the same day… the former Prime Minister of our country Smt  Indira ji was assasinated."
It was a traumatic moment for our country.
"Today, I pay homage to her too."
"My  dear countrymen, today, if one story that rings from home to home, and  rings far and wide,is heard from north to south, east to west and from  every corner of India, then that IS the story of cleanliness and  sanitation."
"Every person, every family, every village wants to narrate  their pleasant experiences in relation to the cleanliness mission,  because behind this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 125 crore  Indians."
The outcome also belongs to  125 crore Indians.
But therein lies a pleasant and interesting  experience too.
"I heard it and I think, I will share it with you too."
"Just imagine the highest battlefield in the world, where the temperature  drops from zero to 50-60 degrees minus."
Oxygen in the air is also at a  miniscule level.
Living in the midst of such adverse conditions and  challenges is not less than any display of valour.
"In such a difficult  situation, our brave heart soldiers are not only protecting the borders  of the country, but are also running a ‘Swacch Siachen’ campaign in that  arena."
"On behalf of our countrymen, I  commend the Indian Army for this amazing commitment."
I also express my  gratitude.
It is so cold there that its near impossible for anything to  decompose.
"In such a situation, the segregation and management of  garbage is a very important task in itself."
"In this scenario, to remove  130 tons and more of garbage from the glacier and its surrounding area’s  fragile eco-system is a great service!"
It is an eco-system which is  home to rare species like the snow leopard and rare animals like ibex  and brown bears.
We all know that Siachen as a glacier is a source of  rivers and clean water.
"Therefore, running a cleanliness campaign here  means ensuring clean water for those who live in low-lying areas and  also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok."
"My  dear countrymen, festivals are occasions that awaken a new  consciousness in our lives."
"And especially during Diwali, it is  customary in every family to buy something new, get something from the  market in smaller or larger quantity."
I had once said that we should try  to buy local products.
There is no need to go to the tehsil if our need  is met in our village.
"If it is found in Tehsil, then there is no need  to go to the district."
The more we try to buy our local things; the  'Gandhi 150' will become a great event in itself.
"And I keep insisting  that we must buy some handloom products made by our weavers, our khadi  artisans.Even during this Diwali, you must have bought quite a few  or a lot of things before Diwali."
But there are many people who think  that if they go shopping after Diwali then may be they could get a good  bargain.
"So there will be many people, who still have their shopping  left."
"Hence along with the best of wishes on Deepawali, I would urge you  to come forward and become a patron of local things and buy local."
"And  witness for ourselves, how we can play an important role in making  Mahatma Gandhi's dream come alive."
I once again wish you all the very  best on this auspicious festival of Diwali.
In Diwali we burst fire  crackers of all kinds!
"But, sometimes fire is caused due to  carelessness."
An injury can also occur.
I urge all of you to take utmost  care of yourself and also celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
I extend many felicitations to you.
Thank you very much.
Namaskar.
"The entire country welcomed  them with open arms, with high spirits."
"And  for long, brave hearts have been responding to the challenge."
"It will not just be a loss of a game; it  will be the loss of the spirit of childhood, something that will exist  only in the verses of poetry. Take away all my riches, bereave me of all this fame, snuff out my youth if you so wish But do return the monsoon that drenched me as a child, the puddles & my paper boats, the magic of my rains."
"And we will be forever reduced to listening to this song, hence we must  keep our traditional sports alive."
"It is crucial that today schools,  neighbourhoods and youth congregations should come forward and promote  these games."
There was also loss of life and property.
"Centuries ago, the great Sanskrit Poet Bhartahari had  written in his ‘Shataktrayam’. धैर्यं यस्य पिता क्षमा च जननी शान्तिश्चिरं गेहिनीसत्यं सूनुरयं दया च भगिनी भ्राता मनः संयमः।शय्या भूमितलं दिशोSपि वसनं ज्ञानामृतं भोजनंएते यस्य कुटिम्बिनः वद सखे कस्माद् भयं योगिनः।"
"The  practice of yoga leads to building up of courage, which always protects  us like a father."
The practice of yoga leads to germination of a sense  of forgiveness in the same manner as a mother has for her children and  mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
"Bhartahari has said that with  regular yogic exercise, truth becomes our child, mercy becomes our  sister, self restraint our brother, earth turns in to our bed and  knowledge satiates our hunger."
Who amongst us does not know the Vedic shloka 'Tamso Ma  Jyotirgamaya'!
"Through ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I once again have been blessed with the  opportunity to be face-to-face with you."
"I am sure you distinctly  remember that for the last many months, a naval team comprising six  women Commanders was on a voyage."
I want to tell you something about the  ‘Naavika Saagar Parikrama’.
"These six illustrious daughters of India  circumnavigated the globe for over more than 250 days on board the INSV  Tarini, returning home on the 21st of May."
"They traversed a multitude of  oceans, many a sea, over a distance of almost twenty two thousand  nautical miles."
This was a first of its kind event in the entire world.
"Last Wednesday, I got an opportunity to meet these daughters and listen  to their experiences."
"Once again, I congratulate these daughters and  their spirit of adventure for bringing laurels to the country, for  raising the glory of the Navy and significantly so, for conveying to the  world that India’s daughters are no less."
Who does not know of the  sense of adventure?
"If you view the journey of human evolution, you will  notice that breakthroughs in progress have taken birth in the womb of  some adventure or the other."
"There is an umbilical link between  development and adventure; the resolve to achieve something, the burning  desire to do something unparalleled, the sentiment proclaiming “I too  can do it”."
"The number of such people may be miniscule, but they turn  out to be sources of inspiration for millions of others, spanning an  array of eras."
"Recently, you must have come across quite a few notable  happenings pertaining to mountaineers attempting to scale Mount Everest. For centuries, Everest has been throwing the gauntlet at humankind. And  for long, brave hearts have been responding to the challenge."
"On  the 16th of May, a team comprising five tribal students of an Ashram  School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra- Maneesha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant  Madhavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam- scaled the world’s highest  peak."
"These Ashram School students began training in August, 2017।"
"These young boys  & girls had been selected under ‘Mission Shaurya’. True to its name,  they brought glory to the country with their brave deed of conquering  the Everest."
"I congratulate these young friends and members of the  school in Chandrapur, from the core of my heart."
"Just a while ago, 16  year old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to scale  Everest from the Nepal side."
"Heartiest congratulations, Beti Shivangi."
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the first ever father-daughter duo  to ascend Everest.
And it’s not that only the young are climbing  Everest.
"On the 19th of May, Sangeeta Bahal, aged more than 50, scaled  the Everest."
"There are some mountaineers who have shown that apart from  possessing skills, they are sensitive too."
"A  few days ago, under the ‘Clean Ganga Campaign’, a group from the BSF  Scaled the Everest and while returning, removed loads of trash littered  there and brought it down."
This deed is commendable indeed; it also  displays their commitment towards cleanliness and the environment.
"People have been ascending the Everest for years & many have managed  to reach the peak successfully. I congratulate these daredevils,  especially the daughters from the core of my heart."
"My  dear countrymen, especially my young friends, just a couple of months  ago, when I mentioned ‘Fit India’, I did not think it would draw such a  good response; that a large number of people would come forward to  support it."
"When I say ‘Fit India’, I believe that the more we play, the  more we will inspire the country to come out & play."
People are  sharing videos of Fitness Challenge on social media; they are tagging  each other to spread the challenge.
Everybody is now getting connected  with this Fit India Campaign.
"People from the film fraternity, from the  world of Sports, common citizens of the country, members of the armed  forces, school teachers or even those toiling in fields and farms, their  rising notes are building up a crescendo ‘Hum Fit toh India Fit’… ‘If  we are fit, India is fit’."
"For me, it’s heartwarming that the captain of  the Indian Cricket team Virat Kohli ji has included me in his  challenge… and I too have accepted his challenge."
"I believe this is  gainful and this kind of a challenge will inspire us to be fit along  with others, as well."
"My  dear countrymen, many a time in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, you must have heard me  mention a thing or two about sports & sportspersons."
"And in the last  episode, our heroes of the Commonwealth Games shared with us their  ‘Mann Ki Baat’, matters close to their hearts through this programme."
"Chhavi  Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call."
"It is true that  sports & games that were once a part & parcel of every child’s  life, in every lane in the neighbourhood, are fading into oblivion."
These games used to be a special feature of summer holidays.
"Sometimes  in scorching afternoons; at times after dinner, children used to play  with exuberant abandon for hours together, leaving all worries behind. Some games saw the participation of the whole family. Aiming the ball at  the crooked column of stone slats- Pitthoo, playing marbles, testing  one’s agility in Kho kho, spinning the top, Lattoo, or applying skills  in swiftly flicking the tapered- edged wooden peg and hitting it  aloft-Gilli-Danda, innumerable games were an inseparable part of each  & every child’s life from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to  Kamrup."
"Aiming the ball at  the crooked column of stone slats- Pitthoo, playing marbles, testing  one’s agility in Kho kho, spinning the top, Lattoo, or applying skills  in swiftly flicking the tapered- edged wooden peg and hitting it  aloft-Gilli-Danda, innumerable games were an inseparable part of each  & every child’s life from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to  Kamrup."
"Of course, those games were known by different names, depending  on the place."
"Some called it Lagori, at other  places it was Satoriya, Saat Pathar, Dikori, Satodiya… one game with  many names!"
Traditional sports and games comprise both varieties…  outdoor and indoor as well.
"The unity, intrinsic to our country’s  diversity can be witnessed in these games."
A single game is known by  distinct names at different places.
I am from Gujarat. I known of a game  played in Gujarat called Chomal Isto. It is played with cowries or  tamarind seeds or dice on an eight by eight square board.
It used to be  played in almost every state.
"Known as Chowkabara in Karnataka, Attoo in  Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakaali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Daayaam  and Thaayaam in Tamilnadu, Changaa Po in Rajasthan, it had innumerable  names."
Who amongst us would not have enjoyed playing Gilli-Danda in our  childhood?
This is a game that is played across villages and cities.
It  is also known by different names.
In Andhra Pradesh it is called  Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
"In Odisha it’s called Gulibadi and in  Maharashtra, Vittidaaloo."
Some games are seasonal.
There is a season for  flying kites.
"While flying a kite or playing a game, one freely  expresses one’s inherent unique qualities."
"You must have seen many a  child, shy by nature, leap up with zest, the moment a game begins. Even  children with a seemingly serious countenance start expressing  themselves; while playing, the innate child within them comes to the  fore."
"Traditional sports and games are structured in such a manner that  along with physical ability, they enhance our logical thinking,  concentration, alertness and energy levels."
"Games are not just games;  they teach us values in life, such as, setting targets, building up  determination, developing team spirit and fostering mutual co-operation."
"I recently noticed in a training programme in Business Management, our  traditional sports and games being used for improving overall  personality development and interpersonal skills."
"From tiny tots to  Grandfather-Grandmother, when we all play these games together then the  term ‘Generation Gap’ disappears on its own."
"At the same time, we also  come to know about our culture and traditions."
"Many games also make us  aware about our society, environment and other spheres."
"It  is a matter of concern, whether these sports & games will fade away  to the point of extinction."
Through crowd sourcing we can create a very large archive  of our traditional games.
"The Videos of these games can be shot,  outlining the way to play these games along with the mandatory rules and  regulations."
"Animation films can also be made so that our young  generations for whom these games played in our streets are something to  marvel about, can see, play for themselves and thus bloom.My dear  countrymen, on the 5th of June, our nation, India will officially host  the World Environment Day Celebrations."
This is a very important  achievement for India and it is also an acknowledgement as well as  recognition of India's growing leadership in the direction of tackling  climate change.
This  time the theme is 'Beat Plastic Pollution'.
"I appeal to all of you,  that while trying to understand the importance of this theme, we should  all ensure that we do not use low grade polythene and low grade plastics  and try to curb the negative impact of plastic pollution on our  environment, on our wild life and our health."
Let us all visit the World  Environment Day website ‘wed-india 2018’ and try to imbibe and  inculcate the many interesting suggestions given there into our everyday  life.
"Whenever we face a torrid summer, or floods, incessant rains  or unbearable cold, everybody becomes an expert, analyzing global  warming and climate change. But does empty talk bring about any  solutions?"
"Being sensitive towards nature, protecting nature, should  come naturally to us; these virtues should be embedded in our sanskar."
"In  the past few weeks, we all witnessed that there were dust storms in the  different regions of the country, along with heavy winds and unseasonal  heavy rains."
""
"These calamities  are basically the result of the change in weather patterns. Our  culture, our traditions have never taught us to be at loggerheads with  nature."
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this  wisdom at every step of his life.
"Today when India speaks of climate  justice or plays a major role in the Cop21 and Paris agreements or when  we unite the whole world through the medium of International Solar  Alliance, they all are rooted in fulfilling that very dream of Mahatma  Gandhi.On this environment day, let all of us give it a good thought  as to what can we do to make our planet cleaner and greener?"
How can we  progress in this direction?
What innovative things can we do?
The rainy  season is fast approaching; we can set a target of achieving record  plantation of trees this time and not only plant trees but also nurture  and maintain the saplings till they grow.
"My  dear countrymen and especially my young friends, you do remember the  21st of June now; not only you and I, June 21st remains a part of the  entire world’s collective consciousness."
The 21st of June has been  mandated and is celebrated as the International Yoga Day in the entire  world and people start preparing for it months in advance.
The news  being received these days is that there are preparations afoot in the  whole world to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day.
Yoga  for unity and a harmonious society conveys a message that has permeated  the world over.
"Centuries ago, the great Sanskrit Poet Bhartahari had  written in his ‘Shataktrayam’."
"This  observation expressed centuries ago, straightaway implies that  practicing yogic exercises on a regular basis leads to imbibing benefic  attributes which stand by our side like relatives and friends."
"When so many attributes become one's  partner, then that yogi conquers all forms of fear."
"Once again, I appeal  to all the citizens to adopt their legacy of yoga and create a healthy,  happy and harmonious nation."
"My  dear countrymen, today is the 27th of May, the death anniversary of the  first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji."
I render my  pranam to Pandit ji.
Memories of this month are also linked with Veer  Savarkar.
"This was the very month, the month of May 1857, when Indians  had displayed their strength against the British."
"In many parts of the  country, our youth and farmers demonstrated their bravery whilst  standing up against the injustice."
"It is indeed sad that we kept on  calling the events of 1857 only as a rebellion or a soldiers’ mutiny for  a very long time.In fact, May 1857 was not only evaluated as a  minor historical incident but was also an attempt to dent our  self-respect."
It was Veer Savarkar who boldly expostulated by writing  that whatever happened in 1857 was not a revolt but was indeed the First  War of Independence.
Savarkar along with his band of brave hearts  celebrated the 50th anniversary of the First War of Independence with  great fanfare at India house in London.
It is also an amazing  coincidence that the month which witnessed the First Struggle for  Independence was the month in which Veer Savarkar ji was born.
Savarkar  ji’s personality was full of special qualities; he was a worshipper of  both weapons or shashtra and Knowledge or shaashtras.
Generally  Veer Savarkar is renowned for his bravery and his struggle against the  British Raj.
"But besides these sterling qualities, he was also a  striking poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on goodwill  and unity."
A wonderful account about Savarkarji has been given by our  dear honorable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
"Atal ji had said - Savarkar  means brilliance, Savarkar means sacrifice, Savarkar means penance,  Savarkar means substance, Savarkar means logic, Savarkar means youth,  Savarkar means an arrow, and Savarkar means a Sword!"
What an  accurate depiction of Savarkar by Atal ji!
Savarkar marched along with  both poetry and revolution.
"Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a  courageous revolutionary."
"My  dear brothers and sisters, I was watching a story on TV about our  underprivileged daughters of certain slums in Sikar, Rajasthan."
"Our  daughters, who were forced to sift through garbage and beg from home to  home in order to earn a living - today they are learning sewing and  stitching clothes to cover the impoverished."
This is an example where  the daughters are stitching ordinary to good quality clothes for  themselves and other families.
"Along with this, they are undergoing a  training course in skill development."
These  daughters have become self-reliant today and are living their lives  with respect and have become a strong support to their families.
"I wish  all these daughters, brimming with hope and trust, a very bright future."
They have demonstrated that if you have the desire to do something and  if you are determined towards that goal then success can be achieved  despite all odds!
"And this is not only about Sikar, but in every corner  of India, you will witness something akin to this."
"If you observe in  your neighbourhood, then you will witness for yourselves how people  overcome the difficulties in their lives!"
"You  must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, and enjoy tea  there, a discussion with some of the customers automatically ensues."
"These discussions are also political and social in nature, can be about  movies, sports and sportspersons or can focus even on the problems of  the country – any problem with probable solutions are discussed at  length – but often the problems and their solutions remain limited to  such animated discussions only."
"Such is the story of D. Prakash Rao, living in the slums of Cuttack,  Orissa, who gave up everything of his in order to adopt and realize the  dreams of others!"
Just yesterday I’ve had the good fortune of meeting D.  Prakash Rao.
Shriman  D. Prakash Rao has been a tea vendor in the city of Cuttack for the  past five decades.
A meagre tea vendor; today you will be surprised to  know that the lives of more than 70 children are being illuminated  through education due to his efforts.
"He has opened a school named 'Asha  Ashvaasan', spending 50% of his income for children living in slums and  hutments."
"He ensures education, health and meals for all the children  coming to this school."
"I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work,  his persistence and for providing a new direction to the lives of those  poor children attending his school."
He has banished the darkness from  their lives.
"His life is an inspiration to us, our society and the whole country."
Your surroundings too must be full of such inspiring happenings.
There  must be innumerable incidents.
"Come, let us take positivity forward."
"The  month of June is so hot that people anxiously wait for the rains,  gazing towards the sky for the clouds to appear."
People will wait for  the moon in a few days from now onwards.
Witnessing the moon means that  the festival of Eid can be celebrated.
"After an entire month of fasting  during Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a harbinger of celebrations."
I  hope and believe that everyone will celebrate Eid with gaiety and  fervor .
I  hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of  harmony in our society.
Heartiest felicitations to all of you.
"My dear  countrymen, many thanks to you all."
We shall meet once again in another  episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ next month.Namaskar
